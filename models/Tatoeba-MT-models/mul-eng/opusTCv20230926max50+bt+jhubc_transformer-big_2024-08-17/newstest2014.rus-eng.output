In Kineshma and the area, two men committed suicide.
Previously, one of the hanged had already attempted suicide.
On October 30, around 1-00, in the village of Lugovoye at the place of his residence, a man born in 1947 committed suicide through hanging.
It is known that he had already attempted suicide earlier.
What prompted a man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, 11-50, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, died at the place of residence.
No signs of violent death have been found, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Kineshemsky" reports.
Do you have a black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find money to repair a crumbling system of roadways, many are starting to see a solution in a small black box, neatly mounted on your car’s dashboard.
These devices, which track every mile that a motorist drives and transmits this information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt to modernize America’s outdated highway financing system, undertaken by Washington and the state’s planning authorities.
Usually, the boring arena of highway planning has unexpectedly given rise to intense debates and colorful alliances.
The libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to give the government the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you drive and even, perhaps, the one where you drive them, and then to use that information when creating tax accounts.
Teapot movement in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions regarding private life.
And while Congress cannot yet agree, continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They’re thinking about how the next decade can move on to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already taken to the test these black boxes, some of which have the function of satellite tracking.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not the question on which we may have the right to choose,” said Hassan Ihrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which is preparing plans to begin tracking the state of mile traveled by every Californian motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There are already technologies for that.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Road Construction Fund, which is funded by taxes that Americans pay on auto-fuels.
Americans don’t buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars travel more than a mile per gallon.
The federal tax, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even by one cent at high gasoline prices.
“The gas tax is simply impossible to keep,” said Li Mannic, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices have recently been installed on cars to test the faulty payment system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long run,” he said.
This is called a faulty user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts city liberals, since with the help of taxes it will be possible to change the nature of trips to reduce the loading of roads and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planned bodies in California are looking at this system in the process of developing strategies to achieve the targets set by the state's ambitious laws to combat global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives, Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House Transport Committee, said he also sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Proponents of the free market at the Reason Foundation are also delighted that they will force drivers to pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that’s going to go into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of political affairs Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also backed by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 called on Congress to move towards the wrong payment.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project involving about 10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the fears of rural legislators representing voters who often have to travel many miles in their daily lives to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, follow this path on their own.
The biggest enthusiasm is manifested in the state of Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are drawn to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for mileage instead of a gasoline tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
In New York, it is being considered.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 states of the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they will be able to make these changes.
This concept has not been universally recognized.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track every step of their lives.
“The concern about the ‘big brother’ and such things is a big problem,” said Alouddin Khan, who heads the Nevada Department of Transportation’s strategy and efficiency management department.
It wasn’t what people wanted.
When the tests were in full swing, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, massive technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where there are difficult searches for low-cost technology that would allow the state authorities to take into account the miles driven by the car, but without information about the place and time.
If you can do that, Khan said, society will feel more at ease.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not assist in the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the developing auto insurance market, where drivers pay on the basis of the race.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is periodically downloaded using a modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t track their speed and don’t track their location,” Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage, said in a statement.
There have been several major errors in some of these state pilot programs.
There are far less expensive and less burdensome ways to do so.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with providing drivers with a variety of options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely abandon the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state travel.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea to the guarded public, forcing the devices to do more, not less.
In New York City, transport officials are seeking to develop a tax-deductible device that will also accept parking bill payments, provide “payments as you drive” insurance, and collect a real-time speed data pool from other drivers to fly away.
“Automobilists will be drawn to the participation of the benefits that they will offer,” – says in the document of urban design.
Some designers of transportation systems, however, wonder if all the talk about faulty payment is just a huge distraction.
In the city’s San Francisco Bay Transportation Commission, officials say that Congress could very simply overcome the bankruptcy of the Trusted Highway Construction Fund by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied from drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline to pay their fair share.
“There’s no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission on Legislation and Public Relations.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private lives and a lot of other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure on Russia
The European Union has a backup plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan, if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating a stand-by loan, and another EU official, directly involved in the negotiations, added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the EU itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing disagreements over funding conditions.
He does not believe in the possibility of reforms needed to get help, and the international rating agency S&P, which lowered Ukraine’s sovereign rating to one degree on Friday – to “B-” with “B”.
However, EU representatives say that the IMF can show flexibility in lending conditions, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country’s financial support plan, the EU has a backup option to provide Ukraine with gas, the bulk of which is now coming from Russia.
Perhaps it will be a gas from the Nord Stream or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in case Russia “isolates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that such a method of reverse deliveries to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and will likely lead to a reduction in deliveries to other regions.
"Between EU countries and Ukrainians, negotiations are underway on how to create favorable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," the source added.
Russia is out of the fight for pollution of cities by cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities have been observed in most of the world’s metropolises since the second half of the 20th century.
As a rule, it was either about their redevelopment and expansion of highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for car trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
An example of Singapore is widely known, where a strict quota of the increase in the number of private cars is introduced, and the right to purchase them is purchased at auctions.
Its price can be two to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entry into the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, where entry is only allowed for cars with a certain eco-class, which also use high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
Beijing's Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a "five-year clean air plan" worth a total of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
According to the Director of the Department of Transportation Pollution Control of the Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau of Beijing Li Kunsheng, the main goal of the five-year period is the reduction of leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, and the increase in the number of private cars up to the level of 5 is not higher than the level of 5,
According to the agency, now Beijing’s road transport is responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program is the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
In addition, the urban measures of the "green five-year-olds" include the transport of motor vehicles (cars and motor vehicles) accelerated in comparison with the rest of the country, the introduction of the local system of eco-standards and the marking of cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, the use of motor vehicles (cars and cars)
Beijing’s automotive innovations also include a ban on all private vehicles operating within the 5th traffic ring of the year (six of them in the capital of the People’s Republic of China) one day a week (the corresponding information is contained in the vehicle’s license plate number), as well as the issuance of registration plates for cars (the 2011
According to the current state program “Environmental Protection for 2012-2020”, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011 41% of all emissions of contaminants into the atmosphere of cities came from “moving sources”.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial ones, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In Russia, they are just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy, said that the administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for motor travel are notoriously unpopular and can only be taken by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem associated with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of weakly sensitive to any regulatory effects - service and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the total number of which is not less than 200 %.
Yesterday, urban planners from the center of the ECOM in St. Petersburg prepared a study, which analyzes the balance of urban areas between residential development, the area of road coverage and the amount of road transport.
The main findings of the researchers: the city center is provided with roads twice as much as required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in the parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking, but car storage, not to expand, but to reduce the passage (so that the streets become more pedestrian-friendly), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the territory of the district of the historical center, of the city's 3rd district.
Penalties for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will increase at times
According to the city authorities, the increase in the size of the fines will help to establish order in Vologda and free the streets from the natural palaces and bars.
Most street vendors don’t pay taxes, the products they sell often don’t have proper sanitary control.
This means that the health of the wetlands is at risk.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase by six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, according to the press service of the Administration of Vologda.
Goldman Sachs warns of risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs has warned about the growing risks for Russia’s main driver of fragile economic growth – consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of defaults on unsecured consumer loans and massive reductions in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of this growth.
Recently, it is entirely due to consumption, which almost does not reduce turnover,” said Goldman Sachs’ chief economist for Russia, Klemens Grafe, presenting yesterday a quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
Currently, the nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
At 6% inflation, it will be able to provide future consumer demand around the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so, most likely, they will deal with the optimization of personnel costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages increase by 10%, then GDP - by only 2%, - explained Mr. Grafe.
The companies faced a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to layoffs and unemployment growth.
The Russian business cannot raise wages, comments the chief economist Barclays Capital on Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment is close to historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
In order to shift employees from the side or keep the current ones, employers have to raise wages.
The consumption in Russia of support is alive and very fast growth in consumer credit.
According to Mr. Grafe, due to extremely high consumer borrowing rates, this type of lending does not have a multiplier effect on the economy of the country.
“We have not seen any benefits for the economy from the growth of consumer credit, the money does not divide the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments,” the economist said.
But the problem is, Goldman Sachs is expecting a delay in unsecured loans.
They are taken mainly by the poor people, who have nothing to provide.
The percentages for such loans are high.
As a result, they are not returned more often,” said Mr. Grafe.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is a possible crisis of default on unsecured loans.
The Director of the Bank Institute of WSE Vasily Solodkov already sees signs of a looming banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without having access to the cheap resources that the state banks have, were forced to attract the population's funds below high interest rates.
In response, the state banks went on the path of war and began to reduce credit rates, - continues the economist.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same percentage, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the state banks do not give up dumping, Russia is in danger of a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
Deprivation of licenses from a number of banks in recent weeks has seen economists as a precursor to the mass collapse.
“The state banks themselves will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was initially not designed for a systemic crisis,” the head of the institute warns.
But consumption growth will slow even without a crisis of non-payments, according to the investment bank, - due to the refusal to index salaries of civil servants and military, laid out in the current version of the draft budget.
Partial impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, a decrease in inflation).
But only partially: if investments do not grow (and there are no prerequisites for this yet – see the report), consumption growth will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is confident.
Vladimir Pantyushin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
“The main risk is the continued drop in oil prices,” he says.
According to him, Russia’s economy will begin to decline at oil prices below $90/barre.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is not yet in a position to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has decreased, and banks have started raising rates.
This may mean that they did not trust the Central Bank, which announced the transition to targeting inflation,” said Clement Grafe.
The Central Bank’s interest rate policy does not affect market rates, it only affects interbank lending rates.
"For the Central Bank, this is a breach of all hope," Clemens Grafe said.
The money received at the Central Bank auctions, banks use not to credit the economy, but to manage their liquidity
Once the rate is reduced, the exchange rate immediately changes, which means that the funds are trying to go on speculation against the ruble.
“Early or later, the Central Bank will realize that this strategy is not working,” Mr. Grafe said, noting that the government is planning to release the ruble in “free swimming” by the end of 2015.
But it will either have to do it sooner, or raise the central bank’s key rate (5.5%), he believes.
According to him, the ruble rate is now artificially increased by 10%.
I only rub one way - to weaken, - concludes the expert.
But if the central bank plunges in the financiers, despite the shadow of doubt, that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, it can break the ruble much stronger.
In Chelyabinsk, the Second Congress of Peoples of the South Urals was held.
The Forum is dedicated to the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and areas of the region, representatives of national-cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive bodies - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening international consensus.
Here we can set an example not only to other regions, but also to other countries.
We have no differences and no disagreements.
We live in full mutual understanding,” says Theophan, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoustovsky.
During the meeting, a number of issues were considered, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
As a result, the Assembly adopted a resolution.
The informal part of the forum continued in the theatre of opera and ballet.
Here opened an exhibition of national and cultural associations of Chelyabinsk region.
Snowden is ready to “collaborate” with Germany on the issue of U.S. intelligence
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence chief, said he was willing to go to Berlin to give evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, were unable to answer questions about his activities.
German MP Hans-Kristian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bel met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his date of testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, which a deputy presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, it was said: “Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a betrayal and seeks to criminalize political statements by criminal charges, no, no.
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the U.S. government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German officials, we will find ways to make this possible.”
Relations between the U.S. and Germany have become strained after allegations that the NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Operman, a deputy who heads the parliamentary group that oversees the intelligence service, said that if there is an opportunity to listen to Mr Snowden as a witness, “without putting him in danger and not destroying relations with the United States completely,” it should be used.
Mr. Str<0xC3><0xB6>bel, a Member of Parliament from the Green Party of Germany, posted his photo with Mr. Snowden on Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Streebele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be there “safely,” the MP said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he faced a “hard and constant” campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was inspired by the world’s reaction to “his political statements.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials—including in the United States—considered exposing an uncontrolled system of all-encompassing surveillance useful to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities, “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved.”
Frontier Airlines will charge for hand luggage.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying a manual bet on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a manual bet and $2 for coffee or gas, although their announcement on Wednesday said passengers would be able to leave the entire bank.
The new fee for the manual deposit is applied to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travelers would pay only after leaving for the landing.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said a $100 fee should make passengers take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to charge for it,” she said.
The airlines began charging for the first and second bags, which were delivered in baggage, in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges charge as much as they can in a handbag placed in the upper luggage compartments, which is why these compartments often lack space.
Fees are one of the ways to get passengers to spend less on board.
O’Malley said that this new fee is actually not for the sake of making money.
The fact is that the most loyal Frontier customers claim that finding a place in the top luggage compartments is becoming more and more difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in a row at the departure of the Frontier flight may be able to carry the bag for free, while the next passenger in a row may pay $100 for the same bag.
O’Malley said the change in procedures on the website and at Frontier registration booths is meant to ensure that passengers will know about the collection before they get off the ground.
The new Frontier collection for the manual bet will not start to charge until summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service have to pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of airline tickets after several years of losses.
However, most of them did not touch the fees for the manual bet.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual layoff three years ago, and another Allegiant Air discounter later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a charge is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors additional charges.
According to his estimate in a December 2011 report, the hand-betting fee brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former top manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew a Spirit flight, and he was interested in finding it at the departure when passengers face an unusual Spirit charge for a hand bet.
“The landing process was the smoothest of those I’ve seen in my career at airlines,” he said.
I was expecting to see a cross of teeth and the appearance of a fight at the exit to the landing.
The plane was full, he said, “and the landing passed quickly.”
Frontier also follows Spirit for a fee of $2 for coffee, tea, gas or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who receive a gas or juice can leave their entire bank and that a cup of coffee will be provided free of charge.
It will still be free to distribute the water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but refused to do so seven months later, after passengers began complaining and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier’s initiative to charge for hand luggage, when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is its last step in attracting customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than to contact a travel agency online.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, she began giving twice as many bonus miles as a frequent flyer to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the premium number of miles to 25 percent of the mile trip.
Thus, a trip 1000 miles from Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would allow you to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming a loser.
Revenue fell by 9 percent, and flight opportunities fell by almost 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to repair Frontier’s finances as part of the airline’s sale.
NSA blames "internal error", not hackers in the termination of the site
The covert National Security Agency said on Friday evening that the shutdown of their site for several hours caused a technical breakdown, not hackers, as claimed on the network.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during the planned update,” the agency said in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The statements that the breach in the work was caused by a distributed attack of the type of “no service” [DDoS] are incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems registered that the NSA site did not work for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, a representative of the NSA told ABC News that the agency’s internal secret network was “not at all” hacked.
No classified information is in danger, the representative said.
At least one online group of hacker-activists said it was responsible for deactivating the NSA’s website with the help of a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to engulf the target site by traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is out of order.
The tactics of hackers are relatively simple, and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the supersecret NSA, once nicknamed “No Such Agency”, has found itself in the center of public attention and fierce criticism in recent months after a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and inside the country — all of these files are leaked to the SEC.
The growing controversy around the agency has sparked speculation that today’s incident was the result of targeted actions by hackers.
Bombardier's profit is falling with drop in deliveries and number of orders for aircraft
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, said on Thursday it would cut its net profit by 15 percent under the influence of a reduced number of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway unit.
The Montreal-based company Bombardier also did not publish any data on the flight tests of its latest CSeries aircraft and did not provide new information on whether ambitious plans to introduce the aircraft into commercial operation will be implemented by next September.
After the first flight of an experimental sample of the aircraft, which took place about one and a half months ago, he flew only three more times, causing questions about whether the stage of testing on the schedule is going.
The results did not justify the forecasts and led to a fall of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerxen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, cut his valuation from “over-medium” to “medium” on Thursday because he believes stock growth is limited to the next quarter or two.
“While the decline in the number of aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed by the transport department’s profit indicators,” Doerksen said in a stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight testing program continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect that the market will be more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to take a place in the lower-cost segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus now dominate.
The first experimental sample of the aircraft was presented in March and was first flown in September after several months of delay.
However, the firm’s orders on the CSeries are not too many yet – 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to verify the company’s claims about the fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
In total, there are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Bodwan was confident that Bombardier would reach its target in 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft was launched into commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is moving forward as planned.
“The actual model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Bodwan said during a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned for the flight.
All manufacturers plan the tests in a different way.
We decided to take the first flight and make a break for the upgrades, so we did.
This will be the case during the entire flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is due to be flown in the coming weeks, and all others will follow soon, the company said.
And yet analysts are skeptical of the statement that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it is assessing the time frame for the launch and will provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight testing — though apparently consistent with Bombardier’s internal schedule — reinforces our view that commissioning will be carried out in the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ending September 30, Bombardier’s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted profit per share remained the previous - 9 cents.
Gross income declined slightly – from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected earnings of 10 cents per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer reported that it had set 45 aircraft per quarter, which is less than the figure for the previous year - 57.
The total number of orders dropped from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The order portfolio of the aerospace department was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
“In the aerospace field, the results corresponded to our goals, but a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become an unpleasant factor,” Boduan said.
Gross revenue in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, reported that gross income in this sector rose by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport unit amounted to $32.6 billion as of September 30, which is slightly above the figure as of December 31.
The revenues of the transport unit had a negative impact on the problems with the execution of several large contracts.
The management said that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s shares, which also announced that Google’s chief financial officer Patrick Picchett would join the board of directors, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 in mid-Thursday sales.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and its closest competitor, Bombardier, said on Thursday it had cut its quarterly revenue by 10 percent.
Sony expects to make a lower annual profit.
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony Corporation, has completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, cut the forecast for earnings for the current financial year.
Sony’s results for the period from July to September 2013 turned out to be more daunting than expected, which is due to the fall in demand for TVs, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony’s television business, which brought the company’s first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in the second quarter in three years, fell again to 9.3 billion yen of operating loss in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through tough times, especially as demand for televisions has fallen.
And while competitors are striving to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main rivals, Panasonic, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components: here, sales of the company are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that this figure would be significantly higher and would amount to 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding the product line.
In the middle of this month, it was announced the start of sales of “smart” watches from a Japanese corporation, given a number of fashionable features, which will allow you to get rid of the need for 100 times a day to get out of your smartphone pocket.
After Sony lowered its annual profit and revenue forecast, the company’s shares at the opening in Tokyo lost more than 11% in the morning, dropping to the level of 1668 yen for a single share.
The gene of speech has been a stimulant of synapse formation
Scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School have discovered a protein that allows the “talking gene” Foxp2 to perform its function, stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, on the magazine’s website you can read its brief content.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other themselves.
The researchers found that family members had a violation of the work of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function remains unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least some of its functions Foxp2 performs as a stimulus for the formation of new brain synapses associated with speech formation.
This is done by another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of the 10 similar genes found by the authors, with only Foxp2 relying on its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vocalization, scientists confirmed in an experiment on mice.
When the activity of the gene in animals was artificially reduced, they shouted less when separated from the mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of the emitted sounds was restored.
Previously, mice were also shown to be related to the vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
The animals that introduced a human copy of the gene were eating more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
So far, however, scientists don’t know whether Foxp2’s work is related and, accordingly, managed by SRPX2 to purely “mechanical” properties of sound formation or more subtle processes.
A lawyer with cocaine addiction, who warned the head of a criminal group about a police investigation, is in prison.
42-year-old Basharat Dietta handed over information to criminal authority Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Royal Court.
The prestigious lawyer, who told the drug lord about a major police investigation because he was afraid to expose his secret drug addiction, was jailed for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Dietta gave the criminal authority of Nila Scarborough secret information about his illegal drug trafficking investigation after he was threatened because of his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer named Bash, who was called a “cruel lawyer” among the criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to track Scarborough, which he had previously represented in a drug-related trial.
Officers noticed that 32-year-old Scarborough left three packs of cocaine at a lawyer's house in Blackburn County of Lancaster while he was at a bar association dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta "regularly used" a class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried illegally to obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later jailed after police seized <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine during a series of raids, as well as more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash.
The 42-year-old Ditta was giving information to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be exposed.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors, a law firm based in Blackburn, was covered with shame after admitting his guilt in two cases of intentional obstruction of justice following a three-week Corvette trial.
He admitted to storing cocaine at one of the previous court hearings.
The lawyer's disclosure came after police investigating Scarborough's activity found out that he had been talking to Diett regularly on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked down the suspect and found him walking to Diett's house in Blackburn and placed the drugs of 60 percent purity in a black golf glove under the lawyer's trash cans.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough repeatedly called with Ditt, who was at dinner at the Ivy Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine conversations took place between them.
The court found that Ditta “consistently used” cocaine after tests found traces of a class A drug in his hair, wallet, and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, said he was talking to a suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted their communication was a “lawyer’s secret.”
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, he also had a hair sample taken.
In an interview with the police, he said that along with the workplace, he also had a home office, and the clients came to him home on legal matters.
However, it became known that after major arrests, he called the largest participants in the illegal drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented in court to tell what detectives know about them.
In a statement, White said: “If anyone knows that you should not break the law, that’s a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, as he has entered into too close relationships with certain clients.
The contact we’re talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations will certainly turn out to be legitimate, as he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the ordinary relationship between a lawyer and a client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible in order to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not respect his profession, but shamed it.
He got too close to certain customers, in particular Scarborough, and allowed himself to doubt his uninterestingness.
Ditta pleaded not guilty and said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and would like to pass on Mr. Scarborough’s information, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Holstead of Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Dietta has turned from a criminal lawyer to a criminal as soon as he started buying drugs from representatives of organized crime.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the purposes of the main members of the criminal groups, who instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and instill trust and confidence in the society.
Mr. Dietta betrayed this trust and tried to cover up his profession.
The investigation into Mr. Diett's case was led by the Lancashire Division on a particularly dangerous organized crime, which has already been convicted of three cases of cocaine storage, and now also on obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire for a just trial.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after admitting his guilt in a conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people who participated in the machination were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers, in which he says that the work of his dream is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the ideal companion for him for dinner – Mohammed Ali, and motivation at work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready for the reception of 22,000 spectators, said police officers, who were present today at the meeting of the KDC of the Russian Federation.
According to them, the ticket program has been exceeded about twice.
During the match 1/16 of the final of the Russian Cup with Spartak, only a thousand stuards were used under the regulation rule of nine thousand.
Spartak fans had 2,200 seats, i.e. 10 percent of the stadium’s capacity, however, in agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5,000 tickets.
This data was announced by the head of the KDC Arthur Grigoryants.
The Americans listened to Japanese high-ranking officials.
On Friday, November 1, one of the U.S. intelligence officials, who preferred not to disclose his name, said the U.S. was listening to phone calls from high-ranking Japanese officials.
This person confirmed that in the country of the rising sun there are several points intended for listening.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
According to him, this was the case during World War II, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are objects for intelligence activities, NHK reported.
Officially, none of the parties has commented on this information so far.
Recall, news of the surveillance of U.S. special services of the German Chancellor appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to listen to Merkel’s phone for the past ten years.
The Chancellor herself, according to some reports, received the news of her hearing very painfully.
She said that the allies, which she believed were Germany and the United States for decades, such an oversight of the head of government was unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was ready to share the details of Angela Merkel’s phone conversation with the German prosecutor’s office staff.
The German flew to Moscow specifically to meet with a former CIA officer.
Bashkiria may put grain on the market not before the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria in the course of state procurement interventions can put grain on the market not before the beginning of 2014, according to the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
As long as the market price is higher, there is demand.
"Perhaps the grain will be put on the market after the New Year," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that in the current year agricultural crop crops under the 2013 harvest amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
Under the 2014 harvest, 550,000 hectares were planted (by 105,000 hectares more than in 2012).
The area under the winter wheat and triticale increased, the rose remained at the previous level.
There is no “Brother’s Circle” group in the MVD bases, to which Leps was assigned in the US.
In the databases of Russian rapists of the group "Brother's Circle", to which Washington attributed singer Grigory Leps, does not matter.
As noted "Interfax" in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after in the media there were reports about the introduction of the U.S. Ministry of Finance Grigory Lepsa in the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brother's Circle", all the gangs were checked.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth about the so-called “Russian mafia”, which allegedly operates abroad, believe in the power structures.
“Even in the title itself – ‘Brother’s Circle’, there is some element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret lodge.
“It’s all very much like a pear-action,” the agency’s interlocutor said.
On October 31, the U.S. Treasury announced the inclusion of Arthur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergey Moskalenko, Yakov and Ryba in its checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate.
Persons included in this list are suspected of being in contact with some Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on the U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the US authorities, Grigory Leps "serves as a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev".
In the production center, Grigory Lepsa refused to comment on US accusations against the singer, calling them "cold".
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama referred the Brotherhood syndicate to the "substantial transnational organized criminal groups" and commissioned the minfin "to suppress and prevent their global criminal operations."
The blacklisting of a person in the U.S. Mint entails blocking his assets in the U.S. and prohibiting business contacts with him or her in the U.S.
The video went to the police.
Toronto's head Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and blatantly reckless outings, caught on smoking crack.
Police in the Canadian city said they have a video and are ready to start an investigation against the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reported.
The information that the authorities have evidence of Rob Ford's drug use appeared on the Toronto police website.
The head of the local law enforcement authorities, Bill Blair, held a press conference on the matter.
The sheriff said he is not authorized to share the footage with the public, but he regrets their existence.
According to Blair, the compromising Rob Ford video was found during an anti-drug raid conducted by law enforcement officers in the summer of 2013.
Earlier on the existence of this video was already written by the Canadian press, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself makes no comment on the matter.
He just says he's not to blame for anything and he's not going to resign.
The video found by the police is one of the evidence in the case of a 35-year-old friend of Ford Alexander Lisie, who is accused of trafficking in drugs, extortion, obtaining illegal income, as well as criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Lizzy served as the driver of Rob Ford.
Residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public in drunk form, allowed himself racist and sexist statements.
Rostovaeroinvest JSC recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the choice of the general designer of the facility.

A politician in Turkey has declared a hunger strike against a wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, authorities began the construction of a partition wall in the area of the city of Nusaybin in south-eastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish PMD party strongly opposed the construction.
A mayor on the border with the Turkish city of Nusaybin Aishe Gekhan has declared a hunger strike, protesting against the construction of a partition wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, RIA Novosti reported in the press service of the Party of Peace and Democracy (PMD) in Friday.
The police have repeatedly staged protest demonstrations.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammar Guler first denied the construction, then said the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"Mayor Nusaybin Aishe Gekhan, a member of the PMD, declared a hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a death struggle," the party's press service said in a statement.
The mayor believes that the construction of the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds crossed the border freely for half a century.
“This is an inhuman situation that the Kurds will never agree with,” Aishe Haekhan, a party spokesman, said.
According to the press service, on November 7, a rally against the construction of a partition wall is planned in Nusaybin.
Venezuela to set exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency - the Bolivar - in relation to the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on November 1, citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand U.S. dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the country’s purchased bolivars at the time of departure.
The specific exchange rate for the dollar will be set later.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
In the black market, however, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, Bolivia has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
The Minister of the Petroleum Industry and Vice President of the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, said on October 18 that Venezuela had no plans to devalue the Bolivar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to lower its national currency rate after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of withholding prices for consumer goods and products, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, led to a shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
Andrey Belmach, director of Yugra, said it was difficult to say how long it would take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergey Shepelev.
The resignation happened just a few hours ago, so to say how much time it will take to find a new coach, I am not ready, - says ITAR-TASS Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are studying all possible options.
The priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I want not just to find a coach, but a person who will work in our club for several years and get certain results with it.
Kenyan press outraged by provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there is a reason for the question: what may not allow Parliament to destroy the independence of the judicial system in the future?” the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punishable, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, a parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased as it is a continuation of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us and we are asking him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law will essentially allow the government to "take the media dead", and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya "had received a serious blow", and criticized the bill as "draconian".
The adoption of the bill is part of measures taken to strengthen national security after the September attack by Muslim terrorists in the Westgate shopping center.
Kenyan media have angered authorities by broadcasting footage of surveillance cameras, where troops, who were sent to the scene of the attack, are allegedly robbing an expensive shopping mall.
The response of police chief David Kimajo was the call of two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was cancelled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, the publication can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists – up to one million with an additional risk of being “excluded from the lists”, i.e. getting a ban on obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender's property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations.”
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya’s so-called “revived blogosphere.”
Politicians understand that by forcing the media to shut up, they will be able to do whatever they think is unpunished.
“No one will ever know,” Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew wrote, describing Kenyan media as a key source of deterrent and balancing forces in public life.
“Politicians presented themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to the hunt and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been targets of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to cancel the cuts appointed by the National Wage Commission and restore the size of their huge salary, amounting to about 532,000 shillings a month, not taxed, — one of the highest in the world.
In the municipal payments of the burglars will appear a new line of expenses - accounting for the capital repair of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact norm will be determined by the government of the region.
But when you paint the entrance, arrange the staircase cells or even replace the elevator - the residents will decide themselves.
This law was approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, the chairman of the Voronezh regional Duma, noted: "In this case, it is also necessary to establish order - to establish the order of the capremont of houses, to accumulate funds not in the management companies - which we often register in Moscow, it will be in Orenbuer, it will be the re-registering of the state, it will be in Orenbuer.
Under the control of the state now and the partial construction.
The law, which protects against fraud, is approved by the aggrieved party in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people have been injured by dishonest builders.
The problems of the majority were solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and responsibilities for all participants in the share construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that abuses in this area also began, due to the fact that in 98 years the same shareholders fell, and in 2000 the same shareholders."
People began to earn money on this to cover the loophole, including the adoption of these two laws.
Under Voronezh, it was decided to build a temporary residence center for foreign citizens to be deported.
The regional parliament passed such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
The problem of illegal migrants in the region is at least slow down.
So, last year, a little more than 100,000 foreigners joined the migration account.
However, only one in five of them issued an official work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "They have violated the law, but they are not criminals."
There is no court, and you have to be deported - you have to keep them somewhere.
Such a decision was taken by the Federation that, through regional means, such places should be equipped.
In the Voronezh region such a place is defined - it is the Old Olshanka of Semiluk district.
Well, finally, the regional parliament has granted new benefits to multi-child parents.
First, families where 5 or more children are raised are completely exempt from the transport tax.
In this case, the budget is lost 3.5 million – but so is the savings of many parents.
Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who will adopt 3 or more children, from the new year will issue housing subsidies.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30,000 per meter.
A family, for example, of 6 people - a father, a mother, a mother-in-law and a third - adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the state buys housing with an area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West microregion - a quite acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage at the resort for that amount.
Baumgertner nominated to the Board of Directors of "Uralkalia"

Later, however, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said at a press conference that Baumgertner’s accusations were reclassified as “the kidnapping”.
Matt Dalton, the "Nephtheimist", refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krykunov from the position of the mentor of the lower house.
Holkiper believes that the incumbent head coach Dmitry Balmin enjoys great authority from the players and will cope with his responsibilities.
Recall, today, "Neftechimik" sent to resign Krykunova.

U.S. Secretary of State: Security services sometimes “go too far” when collecting data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that when collecting data and wiretapping, U.S. intelligence agencies sometimes “walked too far,” however, the politician noted that the information appearing in the media about the wiretapping of 70 million people did not correspond to reality.
I assure you that innocent people were not harmed during this process, but the attempt to gather information was.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was of an irregular nature.
I recognize this, as the president acknowledges ... and we will ensure that this does not happen in the future,” the secretary of state said.
Italian workers with interns give way to young people
Italy's unemployment hit a record high.
The data released on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country’s population is now unemployed.
Such bad things have not happened since the Second World War.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of residents between the ages of 15 and 24 have no employment.
In the opinion of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already being conducted by the country’s largest energy company, and the laws passed allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement for workers with interns.
However, Italy, on the other hand, is waiting for the general problem of the ageing population for Europe.
And economists aren’t sure that the delay with the premature rotation of the personnel justifies itself.
What will lead to the construction of TPU in Moscow
With each passing year, the capital authorities promise to equip more and more transport-transition hubs (TPUs).
By 2020, it is planned to put in place 255 TPUs.
As far as the project is concerned, our correspondent understood.
A few months ago, a construction fence was built at the metro "Smolenskaya" Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.
The inscription said that the installation of the transport-transition node is underway.
All this was very strange, because next to "Smolenskaya" no ground transport is stopped and, therefore, it is not possible to move on it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, it is necessary to overcome about 130 meters, including the ground crossing through the Karmanitsa Pass.
Now in Smolensk, almost everything is finished.
The flower lark disappeared, a newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance was replaced by a birch.
Here's the whole transport node.
Transport and transfer nodes are flat and capitalized, - explained in the press service of the capital's transport department.
There are no capital injections yet.
And the flats involve the construction of parking lots, the extraction of commercial facilities that hinder the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and improvement.
In fact, flat TPUs are not even occupied by transporters, but by professional repairers from the department of capital repair of the city of Moscow.
The transport node is not necessarily a complex structure, - explains the director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes there are enough roofs over the head and a signboard warning about the time of the arrival of the transport.
Here, for example, the metro "Yasenevo" recently opened a fully-fledged flat transfer node.
Let no curtains, but with parking spaces and a sign indicating when the bus will arrive.
But in pursuit of the number of officials record everything in the TPU.
As early as 2011, the mayor planned to build on all 151 nodes, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now, the plans for 2020 amount to 255 TPUs.
Half a dozen of them promise to give up this year.
Although there is a program of development of TPU in the city, no quality criteria are specified, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization "City and transport".
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of the transplant on each of them often deteriorates.
The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: first - reduction of transfer time, second - convenience.
First of all, it is possible to change the mode of transport without going into the rain.
In Moscow, when arranging the TPU sometimes goes exactly the opposite way.
A bright example of the metro "VDNH".
Previously suburban buses from Yaroslavl Highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the VVC.
Now their stops have been moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavlka to the street of the Cosmonauts.
Far away from the metro, far away from the monorail, but closer to the residential houses.
As a result, the residents did not want the bus station under the windows and complained in all possible instances.
With the capital TPU in Moscow, it was not immediately established.
The first of them began to build five years ago at the Metro "Plannernaya".
The project was designed to be exemplary.
And it really turned out a sample of how a transfer node, dedicated to the redemption of investors, turns into a banal trading center.
No, there's a bus stop, a trailer so you don't go from the subway in the rain, and three floors of the parking lot.
However, the chemical trolleybuses No202 and No203 in the Moscow TPU did not give places in principle.
They were pushed away from the subway like strangers.
There are still more places to trade.
One only clothes 32 stores, and in general there are almost everything - from zookeepers to the car showroom.
Well, in fact, suddenly, who of the passengers of the bus will need to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital TPU, for some reason there is always a shopping center.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion, when some of the parking lots decided to market.
Now on the third floor of TPU "Planernaya" among the parking spaces located on the floor there is a boycott trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech, and bodyguards looking at our photographer maliciously.
The transfer node has finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact is that earlier the metro "Planernaya" had a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, the merchants complained and let on the interceptive parking of the crossing node.
However, because of the high prices there is always empty.
The funniest thing is that the market is down to build a new flat TPU in its place.
That's the rocking.
In the metro "Kaluzhskaya", the distance of the approach from the vestibule of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the entire mall.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to circumnavigate it under the open sky.
However, the constructions on "Planerna" and "Kalujska" will soon be shown with flowers.
In mid-September, the City and Land Commission of the City Council approved the planning decisions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25-story, not counting two or three underground yards.
The main monster will grow at the metro "Tusino", it will be 418.7 thousand square meters of area.
Representatives of the Directorate of Railway Stations of RZD, responsible for the construction of the TPU at the metro, have already told journalists: in future multi-storey will be located shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials assure that multi-storey car parks are muddy from a third to a half of the area.
Take, for example, the public garages.
Let’s say, the garage for 258 car seats, which was recently built on International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters.
So, for parking for 2,6 thousand cars in "Petrovsko-Rasumovskaya" will need about 80 thousand "squares".
That's less than a third of the machine they're going to build there.
Let one or two floors go to each of the bus platforms.
At least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate remain.
And this, for a minute, is almost two Gums.
If the capital TPUs at the stations and stations are built by railways, then the rest of the platforms will be conquered by the metro police.
They also promised that there would be a lot of "functional facilities", including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, in the property department of the city of Moscow recently told journalists that they are developing a draft resolution, according to which investors will be able to apply for a plot for the TPU to the officials directly.
Without any contests.
Therefore, he said that transportation issues for the city are a priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the station "Garvard" in Boston or "Spadaina" in Toronto, - Alexander Morozov is sure.
There, trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the level of the metro and the distance from the metro train to the tram is only 50 meters without exit to the street.
There is no extra trade.
But Moscow officials are throwing away in extremes.
Either we're not going to build anything, or we're going to demolish 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Esser proposes to equate extremism with an insult to patriotic feelings
For the legal protection of patriotic feelings of citizens from the provocations and insults directed against Russia, “Just Russia” offers to equalize the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to punish for this five years in prison.
According to the newspaper "Izvestia", such amendments to the legislation prepared by the promulgation of the Duma Committee on Energy by Oleg Mikheev are already aimed at obtaining a ruling in the Supreme Court and the government.
Under the patriotic sentiments of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional relationship of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for that country, a responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, in domestic legislation there are sanctions for abuse of the formal signs of state power - flags and coats of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be affected by the insult of state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect to our country, is insufficiently worked out in Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites the debates that take place annually on the eve of Victory Day, when some media people allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - every year a real Vakhanaly is held.
Exercising in astrology and an "alternative view" of history, some publicists come to the conclusion that, unfortunately, the cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride for history remains the main “spiritual stronghold” of the nation,” Oleg Mikheev is outraged.
In addition, according to Mikheev, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and it is possible to insult patriotic feelings almost without punishment.
According to the voter, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to prescribe the corresponding punishment in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for punishment for the insult of patriotic feelings: from a 100,000 fine to a five-year sentence.
The 6.6-magnitude earthquake occurred on Thursday, October 31, in the area of the city of Kokimbo in central Chile, Reuters reported.
The quake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers southwest of the city, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS) website.
The bullets were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1 in Moscow).
Nothing has been reported about the victims or about the subterranean pressures of destruction so far.
Chile is located in one of the most seismically active areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of different forces are not uncommon there.
One of the most serious things happened in 2010.
Then the magnitude 8.8 earthquake and the tsunami caused by it led to the death of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile has had the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960 there was recorded a magnitude 9.5.
As a result of this natural disaster, more than five thousand people died.
Dmitry Medvedev: The case of Greenpeace will be considered fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian legislation.
France may have no doubt that the case will be handled in compliance with the law, we hear all concerns.
“We can guarantee compliance with the laws,” Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detained activists, Greenpeace is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisanu, like other activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," RIA Novosti quoted Mr. Ero as saying.
"Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws," Dmitry Medvedev said in his turn.
According to him, the activity of any structure that tries to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including the extraction of energy carriers, is dangerous.
He stressed that these objects “like a powder can,” and recalled what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, reports RIA Novosti.
UN announces new goals for poverty alleviation
The United Nations should immediately begin work on a new set of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “Sustainable Development Goals” for the replacement of the CRT, which expires in 2015, before the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro last night.
They were included in the final version of the document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit participants the night before that it was time to “be above national interests.”
“I am pleased that the UN member states have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating the universal Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will become an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will make every effort to use the powers granted to me by the Member States to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the CTI.
Concern about security in Mozambique is growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under looking at them from the top down the statue of Samora Mashel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands gathered in the center of Maputo to chant slogans about the world at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sus, CEO of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a t-shirt decorated with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday at the capital’s Independence Square.
Within two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo were received, one of the most violent clashes since the truce was concluded more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement that was first supported by the white authorities of Rhodesia, and then by the South African government of the apartheid era as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to again escalate into a full-scale conflict, but recent events have forced foreign investors and local residents to become nervous.
The rates are high for a fast-growing economy, as the opening of huge shale reserves of gas and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion as an investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil and Eni from Brazil.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo Party accuse each other of creating tension.
The Renamo party claims that the government has been the co-ordinator of the latest clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofia, the traditional siege of Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked the Renamo base and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakamu, the group’s leader, Fernando Mazanga, a Renamo spokesman, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Gebuza has tried to dispel concerns about instability.
Gebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama felt he was a "failure" who wanted to use "everything that was left of his power to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns grew after the announcement that Mazanga had declared Renamo's withdrawal from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he meant a non-compliance by the Frelimo party.
“Our goal is to get back to the negotiations, but seriously,” Mazanga said.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tension that has been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebuza and Dhlakama) who have been hit by their heads,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is willing to go to the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already said it will boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The proportion of votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by former Renamo member is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said Mr. Gebuza, who was due to leave the post next year when his second term ended, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capabilities Renamo has, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on the key highway leading from north to south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofal, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beira — a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio halted the use of railways for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was absconding when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo’s party wanted to “warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not going very well,” Mazanga said.
Instability has increased government dissatisfaction, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and recent kidnappings, said Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies with the government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultan, a participant in the demonstration, said people just want stability.
“No one cares about either Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to renew the world, they want free access to the roads,” he said.
A series of premieres of "Art-mainstream" will be held in Moscow
A series of screenings of "Art-mainstream", where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will take place in the cinema "Rolan" from November 1 to 5, the RIA Novosti.
The program "Art-Mainstream" will open the French comedy of director and actress Reim Kerichi "Paris at any cost".
This is the story of a French model working in the French capital of the Maya (Kerichi herself), who is deported to his native Morocco due to visa problems.
In addition to Kerichi's film, viewers will also be shown a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki-duk Mebius, the melodramatic biopic of Oliver Hirshbigel's Diana: A Love Story (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role and the lead role in the film.
The only Russian participant "Art-mainstream" will be the winner at the festival "Kinotavr" film of Alexander Veledinski "Geograph globe is lost" on the motives of the novel of the same name Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - the charming loser-teacher Viktor Sluzhkin - in the film was played by Konstantin Khabensky, whose work was also awarded the "Kinotavra" prize.
Children should study myths and legends as “life-style models,” says the author.
Tales of the Torah could show that “the brute force cannot overcome subtle cunning,” and legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will turn out to be “too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too indecent to teach in schools,” Crossley-Holland advocates a “careful selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it’s great that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I was in favor of introducing them to the curriculum for twenty years.
He added that the “excessive moralization” of authors and teachers “rejects interest” in children, and the main ideas are “sublimated” into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated "Beowulf" from the Anglo-Saxon language and also wrote "A Collection of Norwegian Myths" for Penguin Publishing and "British Folk Tales," said: "You may of course have intentions, but you better keep them with you."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults, and an adult author writing for children, is the need to feel some hope.
It is not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary that there be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; it is revealed through history, and not clearly formulated.
The old principle: to show, not to tell.
In the Voronezh region, a football fan was detained, who broke a window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o'clock in the evening of 29 October at the station Gryazi-Voronezh transport police officers removed from the passenger train two football fans - natives of the Moscow region.
After going to the game of a favorite team, the guys along the way arranged a drunk deboss on the train.
Young people were taken to the working part of the linear police station at Hryazi station to draw up a protocol on administrative offence.
There, the fans repented in their anti-social behavior.
The police drew up administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station began to wait for his arrival.
In the middle of the first night, the fans left the building of the railway station, however, one of them, a 22-year-old boy, unexpectedly returned and broke the window of the entrance to the waiting room of the station.
On the call of the broken glass fell an employee of the transport police and a guard of the CPP "RZD".
They managed to arrest an attacker who tried to escape from the scene of the incident.
The employees of the South-East LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia are being checked.
The issue of the initiation of a criminal case is resolved, said the senior reference of the direction of information and public relations of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on transport Sergey Olkhovik.
Vitaliy Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we came back 15 years ago.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about the riots on the stands during the match of the Russian Cup "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I support the fact that the organizers of sports events are responsible for all this: clubs, leagues, the Russian Federation.
But we can see that they have taken a tough position.
They're waiting for someone to come over and set the order.
This is a very good position, but not quite right.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs should invite their flight attendants, and not let the case stand alone.
We have now developed a special government regulation on rules of conduct in the stadiums.
Once it is accepted, we will deal with this problem completely.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read an interview with Leonid Fedun.
The state, please, let the law go faster.
The feeling that it was the fans of "Bavaria" came to Yaroslavl and arranged it all.
We are third-party observers.
And in general, it's terrible - to see the stands float out of the fire pit.
And this is in a country that is preparing for the World Cup.
“I feel like we’re back 10 or 15 years ago,” Mutko said.
Snowden may be questioned in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden is unlikely to travel outside Russia to give evidence on the cases of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's telephone conversations.
According to Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, an American can answer questions from representatives of the German Prosecutor General’s Office in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure outside of Russia is virtually ruled out.
"In this case, it will lose refugee status and can be issued to Washington by countries - U.S. allies," the agency's spokesman said.
"At the same time, in principle, the Prosecutor General's Office of the Federal Republic of Germany could send its representatives to the Russian Federation or forward written questions to Snowden," the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, the deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Kristian Strebele reported that Edward Snowden was ready to give testimony on the case about the U.S. special services hearing of the Chancellor of Germany's negotiations.
Snowden is ready to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or on the territory of Germany.
The former CIA officer made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the U.S. NSA has blocked all of his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
For this, however, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of its arrival," Strebel told Euronews.
Snowden’s lawyer Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement from an Interfax source, said his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide for himself.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he published information about U.S. intelligence intelligence operations on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow by transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport was cancelled by the U.S. authorities, provisionally making serious accusations against him, and remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport until the beginning of August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document on granting him temporary asylum on the territory of Russia for a year and on the same day left Sheremetyevo.
Yesterday, U.S. attorney Anatoly Kucherena said that his client was set up to work in a “big Russian company”.
German media reported last week about the NSA’s surveillance of Angela Merkel.
According to journalists, the phone conversations of the US Chancellor began to be heard as early as 2002.
The surveillance station was allegedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities after the publication of this information stated that the monitoring of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomarev left “Just Russia”
A member of the State Duma from the party "Just Russia", a member of its Novosibirsk branch Ilya Ponomarev made a statement about leaving the political organization.
As the MP said, he submitted the statement to the party’s Novosibirsk regional office.
According to her charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev has left the ranks of "righteous".
We're sitting, drinking tea...
"For some reason, many want to see the picture "Ilya Ponomarev puts a part-ticket on the table", but there is nothing so epic about it," - commented the MP on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the "essers".
Meanwhile, from the mandate of the deputy of the State Duma, Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to refuse.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and cannot legally leave it.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarev’s intention to leave the “Just Russia” party appeared on October 30.
It was reported that along with him, Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov will leave the "SR", but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the issue of the conclusion of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Fumiyo Kishida, met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to openly exchange views on the further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," he said at the meeting.
Japan’s foreign minister recalled that after Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and acquired a bilateral character.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation will go to Japan in solving complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies the solution of the issue of disputed Northern territories.
In this regard, there are protests in Tokyo today demanding the return of the country lost after the Second World War.
In the Japanese capital, there are cars, of which the loudspeaker reports: "Return the northern territories!".
The police do not stop the protesters, they are watching that the level of noise does not exceed.
Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It can be argued boldly that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, edgy artist Frank Fay, who worked at a conference at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Faye's innovation has over time been embraced by others, quite recently - the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolinas stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started in the Carolinas and then achieved more success, they reached the level when they were already too famous to perform at the club,” Hursh said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as "Standup for Heroes" - an annual music-comedy charity concert for military veterans at the Madison Square Garden, where they will perform amongst others, St. George's, and St. George's.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Several comedians taking part in the festival this year gained popularity in a non-traditional way, for example, thanks to shows on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Croll gained fame thanks to his role in the comedy series on a little-known cable channel (especially the scrumptious FXX "League" on the theme of fantasy football), and now runs his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slater joined the cast on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation Zones", although she is best known for a series of viral films "Marcel - a pumpkin in shoes".
Both Croll and Slate, like other young comedies with a distinctive style (surrealism- pessimistic Anthony Jesselnick, a ludicrous, racially focused Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be an interview by David Steinberg with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but later became a successful director on television and in film, as well as an unofficial comedic historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he was the lead show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is certainly the central element of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walked down some street between the two houses and thought, “If I’m totally out of money, maybe I’ll live here.”
Pakistani authorities have started negotiations with local Taliban forces.
The Pakistani government has begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the country’s embassy in the UK, where Pakistani Prime Minister Navaz Sharif is on a visit.
The head of the government of Pakistan made a statement on talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed issues of Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The prime minister said that dialogue with the Taliban has begun," the Pakistani embassy in London said in a statement.
“He said he hoped and prayed that the dialogue would work in accordance with Pakistan’s constitution,” the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently in the northwestern areas of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are trying to create an Islamic state.
In the past, the government of Islamabad has been trying to start negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement has refused to engage in dialogue.
It said it would only negotiate if the authorities were to take troops stationed in areas where the Taliban are operating and to release the detained Islamists from prison.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London that discussed the prospects for a peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell to $96 a barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, when concerns about the formation of large reserves obscured a message showing that China’s energy-intensive manufacturing sector was gaining strength.
The U.S. oil benchmark in December’s supply rose by 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 a barrel later in the morning for European time in e-commerce on the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract increased by 39 cents, which amounted to a fall in the October price by 5.8 percent.
Rich oil reserves have impacted its value over the past few weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. stocks have increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, the reserves were replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, according to two reports about the Chinese industry, which showed a surge in its activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to gain momentum after the growth rate in the third quarter rose to 7.8 percent after a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent oil, a benchmark of international oil used also by U.S. oil refineries, has been priced at 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the London Intercontinental Exchange.
The head coach of Colorado, Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release goalkeeper Semen Varlamov from the first minutes in Friday's match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not disturb his confidence in the "Shlia" from the Russian, the overrun.
And what are we waiting for," Rua said after the morning launch of Lavin.
Of course, we all worry about what happened, but we are sure of it and feel that it will be useful for him to get out on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure that the situation didn't affect the doorman's condition?
I'll see you today.
Undoubtedly, our players will support Warley by helping him to keep the gate as it was in previous games of the season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to draw any conclusions until the court understands this situation.
In Siberia, it is not worth being a vegan: a thermal tomato will not replace the soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for living in Siberia, RIA Novosti’s correspondent said.
People who are completely deprived of animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they do not tolerate winter without loss of health, and no warm tomatoes do not compensate them, according to Novosibirsk dietitians and doctors polled on the eve of Vegan Day.
Drink oil in liters
Strict vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, doctors-dietologists are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict dietary norms, at least, is not good for health.
The complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain irreplaceable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for by plants.
It is necessary to include in the diet at least milk or eggs,” says the dietitian Marina Bohay.
It is an example of a fish that contains the essential fatty acid Omega-3.
The most abundant vegetable oil they have is flaxseed.
“To consume it in the amounts necessary for a person, you need to drink liters!” – says the dietitian.
Doctors are convinced that the inhabitants of Siberia need to pay special attention to the diet in winter.
During this season, vegetarianism is particularly questionable.
In the conditions of our realities, there are high demands for food.
In order not to freeze, you need an increased caloric content.
“If a person restricts himself to animal products, accordingly, this caloricity he does not get,” says a specialist.
This is according to dietician Olga Pozniak.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not an option.
It is better for a person to eat mainly foods that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is designed to better absorb and digest these products.
And in winter people don’t want to bite a cucumber, but a hot soup or something more delicious,” explains the doctor’s position.
According to her, from the fact that there can be vegans, different cereals, cereals, beans, local vegetables, apples left in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But this is clearly not enough for a full-fledged diet.
According to the gastroenterologist Clavdia Arifulina, the level of vitamins in Siberians in the body is sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
The complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and the snow in May is not ideal.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, first of all, fat,” says the doctor.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.
And by adhering to vegetarianism, we give them incomplete.
Pregnant women also need an increased content of protein, vitamins, and microelements in the menu.
“They’re not going to get it,” God assures them.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, “to play in the toys he wants.”
It has already formed organism, skeleton, organs.
Children need to eat at full value.
If parents deprive him of some microelements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
“The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones will no longer recover tomorrow,” she says.
All the medical experts interviewed agree on the low quality of winter-grown vegetables and fruits grown in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses, contains less of the microelements we need than (grown) in open ground.
“The quality of the food is not that,” God says.
Arifulina also notes that imported and thermal vegetables and fruits are far from perfect standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to harvest more crops is detrimental to quality.
"Apples don't turn brown on the cut, cucumbers quickly yellow and bleak, tomatoes tasteless and unflavourable," - cites examples of doctors, adding that they are likely to be drunk with excessive amounts of fertilizer.
And they become suppliers not of vitamins, but of fiber.
This is not according to the lab of the Siberian Institute of Physical and Technical Agrarian Problems, candidate of the agricultural sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all the norms and requirements in greenhouses, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables.
If you try to expel more from the square meter, then, of course, and water will become more common, and refuel the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and unsweetened,” she explains, adding that the issue of quality, first of all, depends on the conscience of the manufacturer.
The court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of “stop-and-go” in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the federal district appeals court suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department’s “stop-and-visit” program, and removed the judge from the case.
The U.S. District Court of Appeals said that the execution of Judge Shira Sheindlin’s decisions will be suspended until the results of the appeal filed by the city are received.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the constitution in the way it carried out a program of street arrests and interrogations.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and decision on corrective measures, including a prescription to appoint a controller to help the police department change the practice of work and its related training program.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard arguments from the parties on the application for suspension of the case.
The Appellate Court stated the need for the removal of the judge because it violated the U.S. Code of Conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid demonstrations of bias, in part because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements containing a public response to the complaint.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, inadvertently turning to blacks and Latinos under the program “stop-and-go.”
She has appointed an external controller to oversee large-scale changes that include policy, training and control reforms, and has also decided to launch a pilot program to test body-mounted video cameras in those police areas where the majority of the arrests take place.
In August, New York decided to discontinue the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were terminated after a police check.
The city's appeal hearings are due to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of “stop and search” has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
The “search stop” has been practiced for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of whom are black and white.
In 2004, four people, all of them representatives of national minorities, filed a collective lawsuit.
Proponents of the changes in the “stop-and-go” program at the New York Police Department say that these changes will put an end to unscrupulous practices, form a more reliable and effective police service, and can affect how other departmental resuscitations.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce the combat spirit of the police, not the level of crime, will lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve a more global problem of complex conditions in the police due to a reduction in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that it does not stop the “stop-and-go” practice, which complies with the constitution, but changes the way New York police stop people.
In the area of the Tretyakov Gallery opened a pedestrian zone
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the area of Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a plot two kilometers from the metro station "Novokuznetskaya" to Bolotnaya Square.
Throughout the course, street towels, flower pots, cupboards, urns and toilets are installed, deaf shutters and illegal advertising are removed.
In addition to the Klimentovsky and Lavrushinsky lanes, which were already pedestrianized, five streets were closed for cars - the Ordinsky Stupik, the Big and Small Tolmachevsky lanes, the Kadashevsky embankment and Bolotnaya Square.
Traffic on the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka is not limited.
On the site of the Friday street from the vestibule of the station "Novokuznetskaya" to the Klimentovsky pass created conditions for pedestrians without removing movement and cutting the passage part, newsmsk.com reports.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the Temple of the Priestly Man of Clement of the Pope of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously completely pedestrianized were the Tver Pass, Stolesnikov Pass and Kuznetsky Bridge.
The Great Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, is decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson resorted to phone hacking to verify confidential message
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used the "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to corroborate false information about the novel of Charles Clark, who was then serving as Minister of the Interior.
The prosecutor, royal lawyer Andrew Edison, told the Old Bailey court that in May 2005 the News of the World newspaper received false news that Clark was meeting with his "attractive special counsel" Hanna Polby.
The newspaper ordered private detective Glenn Mulkey to break Polby's voicemail and alert her at home to take an interview, but Coleson also called her and left voicemails, the court heard.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a person who will stand next to someone at home hoping to stand up to someone in a hurry, he is a person who likes to offer history to people to see what they say,” he said.
He said the News of the World used three ways of investigating stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "Oh, yes!"
Rumors about Clarke’s novel first attracted the attention of the News of the World, when a source, sexually interested in Mrs. Polby, said: “Don’t waste time, she’s with Charles.”
The tape with voice messages received from her phone at least three times was removed from Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private detective's computer, in which Ms. Polby and her sister were listed as "Projects."
During the period she was under surveillance, Mrs. Polby's grandmother and grandfather received anonymous calls with requests to provide information about her, Mr. Addis said.
During this time, former chief reporter Neville T<0xC3><0xBC>rlbeck and former reporter James Weiserap were monitoring Mrs. Polby's movements.
Leaving her voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and which I would very much like to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Addis said that Coleson's involvement in this story took place in the same scenario as with other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had clashed with Mr. Blankett over a novel with a married woman while he himself was meeting with correspondent Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied entering into a conspiracy with other people in order to break the phone between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkeyr, Thurlbeck and Weserap confessed to breaking up their phones.
Snowden says he's ready to talk to the German authorities about the hearing
Former CIA officer Edward Snowden expresses his readiness to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so and meet with representatives of the German authorities, RIA Novosti reports.
A letter from a former CIA official to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by the deputy of the Bundestag Hans-Kristian Strebel, through which Snowden sent a message to the German authorities.
Strebel met Snowden in Moscow the day before.
Four people were injured as a result of the fire on Tverskaya Street
As a result of the fire in the collector in the center of Moscow, on Tverskaya Street, four passers-by were injured.
According to Interfax, with reference to a source in the emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, the passers-by who were during the fire in a smoky underground passage were injured.
According to RIA Novosti, with reference to the head of the capital department of the fuel and energy industry Pavel Livinsky, electricity supply is now fully restored in all houses on Tverskaya Street.
The fire in the heat collector near the house 15 Tverskaya Street took place on the evening of October 31.
From the holes of the plumbing there was a strong smoke, and in the underground passage, located at the store "Armenia", there was a suffocation.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses were burned down on Tverskaya Street.
At 21:45 Moscow time the fire was extinguished.
U.S. cuts food aid for the poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 a month
Since Friday, the U.S. has cut the financial provision of food stamps, known as "food stamps", as the relevant state program ends.
A family of four will now be allocated $36 a month less than before for food aid, officials say.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in the 2012 financial year, the one-person allowance averaged $133 per month.
U.S. food aid spending has risen to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14% of Americans rely on free food aid, given by “food stamps” that bear this name since ancient times, when they had the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate the growth of the economy and help the poorest Americans.
Republicans in Congress, however, are calling for further cuts in funds allocated to the program, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need it more than others.
The owners of food stores across America are worried that the cuts will lead to a reduction in consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to argue about how to further reduce government funding.
Blizzard Releases 19-Year-Old Platformer for Free
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platformer on PC for free.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game became available on Battle.net in the classic Blizzard games section.
However, some gamers note that currently only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can download it.
For Russian users, the game is not yet available.
As reported by the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on the PC is no different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platformer, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Toul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and light kingdom.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the bright king of Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Wallace Kyle, who was saved from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tutul to fight Sarlak's paratroopers and protect the planet's inhabitants from them.
The original Blackthorne became the first game that the studio released after its rebranding to Blizzard Entertainment.
It was previously known as Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was the publisher of Interplay.
There will be new cars in the Moscow Metro.
But selling tickets to passengers will not be for money, but for sitting.
One trip costing 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 sessions.
The number of sessions will count the special device using modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS with reference to the press service of the Olympic Committee of Russia.
The first device will be installed at the "Exhibition" station on November 8, 2013.
In the presentation of the new ticket machines, the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia Alexander Zhukov and the Olympic gymnasts Alexey Nemov and Elena Zamlodchikov will be accepted.
The National Security Agency’s recognitions strengthen the paranoia of corporations in relation to state surveillance
On a hot day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
According to the instructions of the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), Germany’s domestic intelligence service, his task was to photograph the roof of the U.S. Embassy building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media say BfV hoped to detect the antennas of the listening devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the United States and Germany’s Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, said in September that the U.S. is not using foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies in the interests of U.S. companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who became a whistleblower, began publishing his treasure trove of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company executives are no longer sure if the director can be trusted.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data stored by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised the paranoia of state-run corporations to new heights.
The last drop was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been ringing for perhaps about a decade.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, then, of course, potential targets are also business leaders.
Snowden has made an obvious intense collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I think it’s quite likely that these data are being used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n, president of the BITMi association, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now poses almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the EY consulting agency.
In all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, there was still no evidence that the United States had handed over the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked certain capabilities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says that we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German software provider for SAP business.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Yet the coverage and technical development of U.S. spy agencies, which have become famous thanks to Snowden’s revelations, has come as a shock to some companies who previously thought that the greatest risk of surveillance was China.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technologies, where European company executives are better aware that data stored in the U.S. is in the same jurisdiction and is therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. participants refused to use the services of a U.S. cloud provider after unveiling the U.S. program for Prism data analytics.
Jim Sneeb, one of SAP’s CEOs, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that didn’t arise a year ago, namely: where my data is stored and can you guarantee that it will stay in that jurisdiction physically?”
Many German leaders argue that the latest messages are just a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at all costs.
What’s happening with economic espionage is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy,” said Kurt Bock, Chief Executive Officer of BASF.
Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are spying on them too, because it is in our national interests to protect our commercial enterprises.
The leaders of corporations usually don’t like to brag about the response measures they have taken, as this can give an advantage to the opponent.
In large companies, the idea has long been adopted that taking a free bottle at the exhibition or leaving the laptop unattended in the hotel room is at least inconsiderate.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the automobile construction company Audi, says it has been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so they can’t be used as listening devices.
The Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution of Germany recommends that company executives consider the possibility of using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign trips due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown out.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to breaches and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are the leaders in the world market in their specific niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” BfV warns in the report.
The U.S. is warning its own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Agency in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second-in-command of hackers engaged in economic intelligence after China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are worse than everyone.”
Bernard Scarsini, former head of France’s internal intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “Services know perfectly well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a Georgia teenager who died by “unbelievable accident” believe their son was killed.
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found inside a bent sports mat in his high school gym, believe their son was killed, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of the city of Waldo, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertically standing matte, sent to the stands in the back of his high school gymnasium.
County Sheriff's Department investigators have come to the conclusion that Johnson died by a tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old teenager is contesting it.
“They’re absolutely certain their son was killed,” said Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed that he died the way the sheriff said.
“They think it contradicts logic, the laws of physics, as well as common sense,” Mr. Kramp said.
They think it’s a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son’s death.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a body bag,” he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he is conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday.
I'll learn all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to know the truth.
“I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds” for the official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial disclosure showed that Johnson died as a result of “positional asphyxiation.”
However, the second revelation, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
“There are a few issues that need to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Office was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to publish all video footage of the surveillance cameras that investigators were watching.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the videos contained the key to figuring out how he died.
"Spartak": For information about the persons who hung the fascist symbol
On the official website of Spartak appeared the statement of the Moscow club regarding the appearance on the podium in Yaroslavl of the fascist flag.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) issued recommendations for schools on allergy in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is growing.
One in 20 children in the U.S. now have food allergies.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergy among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides schools with information on how to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergy in children and how to provide assistance in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep the stock of adrenaline — most often used for injections by the EpiPen automatic medical syringe — to provide assistance in potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently amended the regulation to allow schools to make adrenaline reserves with less difficulty.
The notice also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Children can say, “It’s like something’s going on in my language,” “It’s like I have hair on my tongue,” or “Language whispers.”
Parents of intersex children can choose ‘uncertain sex’
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third sex of children born with external sex organs of the intermediate type.
Newborns will no longer necessarily be assigned male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to designate gender as “undetermined” or “undetermined” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could make urgent decisions on the operation of gender allocation to newborns, and to counteract discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex man, according to the BBC, said many years later: “I’m not a man and I’m not a woman.”
I'll stay a doctor-created scarves with bruises and scarves.
About one in two thousand children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexity, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of a "sexual development disorder" - a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or sperm) or unusually developed external sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been an intersex.
Gender identification has not yet been studied enough, however, most experts in the U.S. say that if sex cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it than to wait and track the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation.
A New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said the new German law “sounds like a good idea.”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require prompt intervention, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can assign sex without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not too precise.
No one can answer the questions as to why this is happening.
It's like a mystery to why people are gay.
The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people as different from transsexuals or transgenders, as their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to either the male or the female sex, but is typical of both.
These characteristics can be manifested in secondary sex characteristics such as muscle mass, hair cover distribution, breast and body structure; primary sex characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides a general overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the field of employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and crimes on the ground of prejudice.
Boys with gender bias now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to place male, female or “third gender” in their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old Australian resident, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as a “free” person, defending in court the right to maintain an “uncertain” sex status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use the third designation in addition to M and F - X, i.e. intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues still cause controversy, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this distinctly Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with German law, writing that “in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state where sex is the subject of choice, and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization.”
A mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer for children to have sex at birth.
“Growing a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told the parents’ website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, named after the beautiful Greek god, who possessed the signs of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which everything can be erased and then painted again.
But now many challenge the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is difficult, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive the sex assigned to him when he grows up.
“In the mid-20th century, it was called an ‘emergency psychiatric case’,” Drescher said.
When such children were born, you didn’t call a psychiatrist – you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genitalia was suggested by Dr. John Manny of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easily susceptible to change.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental cues, including social cues—the way parents raise a child—interact with the child’s genes and hormones, determining whether a person will consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as "John/John", his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged during a careless circumcision, to completely castrate the child, also removing his eggs, and to grow it as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but it was not so,” Dresher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dr. Drescher said that now some doctors are still “applying this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these sex-change operations declared themselves “unsatisfied with the result.”
This was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but intermediate-type genitals.
The doctor could not determine whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and was convinced that he would never be able to live a man’s “full life.”
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external genitalia and ovaries were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was prescribed vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a disorder of sexual development that did not allow his body to produce enough testosterone for the normal development of the genitals.
Upon learning the truth, he again became a man, receiving testosterone injections and removing his chest.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he defends others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersex.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law “encourages the imposition of biases and stigmas.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make an urgent decision and give the child “uncertain sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will contribute to the intervention.
We think it’s best to assign a male or female gender, and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is build assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to make choices in favor of the third gender."
“Adults should have the opportunity to make their own decisions about formal sexual affiliation,” she says.
German law implies its attribution at birth.
This is a battle that young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Barac, a Pittsburgh-based mammologist who has a daughter with a sexual disorder and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said German law would “support” both parents and children.
Barac’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called “a syndrome of complete androgen insensitivity.”
Because her androgen receptors are malfunctioning, Katie has developed female signs.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
Now, at age 29, Katie is married and holds an Ordination on Child Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite the fact that she is barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate motherhood.
“The law gives parents time not to make quick decisions on their own,” Barac said.
It gives them time to do some analysis and understand the situation, as well as the time interval before they write “male” or “female.”
In this case, you are fine - grow a child, love a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joy.
We don't need to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“This allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the anxiety that drives parents because they don’t feel they are doing the right thing,” she said.
After all, the child will decide which sex is more comfortable for him or her – and that’s great.
This gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
“Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Habibulin said he understands that he should play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two meetings of Yastrebov, Habibulin first missed six shots from Tampa Bay, and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed shot.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I haven’t been able to do that,” Habibulin said.
“I need to find confidence in training, probably, to approach them as games, and try to achieve a better result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that were.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel pretty good.
But for some reason, after a few heads everything turns into a snow coma.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
Tuesdays - I don't think I'm the only one - always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my door.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss so many buckets.
It’s good that my singles support, but in principle it’s simple: I have to play better.
The two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to spend them much better.
But it happened what happened.
I have to put it aside.
I'll just try to play the next match better.

Medvedev predicts that the SSJ-100 will be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after the consolidation in the markets of Latin America and Asia, Superjet 100 aircraft will also be delivered to Europe.
"We expect that in total, we will get such agreements for more than 170 copies of such aircraft," said Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, speaking at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation with French colleagues has been established, as this is a joint project.
We have discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that he will be delivered to France someday," the Russian prime minister said.
SSJ-100 - an aircraft built by the company "Civil Aircraft Dry" in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Liner has been developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
Energy Dnepropetrovsk has started a unique program to save... nest aist
In ancient times, to lead to the court of the Aists, the peasants on the high pole installed a wheel from the carriage, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special supports have not been laid for a long time, so the assistants loved the poles of the power transmission lines - braided branches rely on the wire, which makes the real house stand reliably.
Grandma Anya, near the house of which in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district for twenty years lives a real family, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds put new twigs on top, and the bottom layer has already slipped between the wires, now it will collapse.
Of course, it is a pity that a family of Aists, who nestled in the courtyard every year, took out and fed three or four birds during the summer, but also do not want to stay without light.
As soon as the birds flew into the warm edges, Grandma Anya called the Tsarychinsky RES, to which the support belongs.
I didn’t expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, - said Sergey Berezovsky, Technical Director of DTEK "Dneprooblenergo".
On the wires, which were, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150 - 200 kilograms, began corrosion.
At any time, the birds could have died from electric discharge.
Even the locals risked being left without light due to damage to the wires.
Therefore, the linear meters began the operation to save the nest, and this is not the first time in our practice.
Assisted by ornithologists from the Dnepropetrovsk National University, who developed a scheme for the transfer of nests.
They also conducted trainings for the staff of the regional networks.
The well-known Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko consulted energy scientists at all stages of the reconstruction of the nest.
To begin with, it was estimated that there are more than 50 authentic "apartments" in the area in the state of emergency.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms resembling a funnel were welded.
The base was flooded with oak branches, and then transferred to the old nest.
According to the connoisseurs, it is enough to lay the old branches as the basis for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
After that, the residents will build their own homes.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka Novomoskovsky district.
Next to the electric pole they put a new reinforced concrete pole and placed on it a platform with an old, already swollen nest.
The entire operation cost the energy workers 9,000 hryvnias.
And the other day the same novice took place in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district in the courtyard of grandmother Ani.
Here the platform was fixed in the previous place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are sure that cautious, conservative birds won’t even notice in the spring that their “apartment” will be subject to capital repairs.
Until the end of the year, the same reconstruction expects four more nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsarychinsky districts of Dnepropetrovsk.
By the way, while some rescue rare birds, others mercilessly kill them.
On the day the whole area flew sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka Apostolovsky district, on the day of the opening of the hunt for pheasants, poachers for entertainment shot the swan family, who lived on the local meadow.
The noble birds were not afraid of people at all - the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers heard the gunshots, they ran to the pond, four beautiful swans were already lying on the water dead.
Now, the staff of the Apostolovsky district police station find out who shot the birds recorded in the Red Book.
The "Russian March" is becoming more popular
On November 4, on the Day of People's Unity, the Russian March will be held in Moscow.
According to a survey by the Levada Center, support for the Russian marches is growing - already 40% of citizens approve of the idea of holding them to varying degrees.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of citizens in different degrees approve the conduct of "Russian marches": of them 11% are definitely positive and 29% - "rather positive".
The popularity of the idea of "Russian Marches" is gradually growing - in 2006 these actions were welcomed by only 14% of Russians, and in December 2010 the holding of such events supported already twice as many citizens (28%).
"Definitely negative" to "Russian marches" are only 7% of Russians, "rather negative" - 19%.
Another 35% were unable to formulate their attitude to this action.
This year, the city of Moscow agreed to conduct the "Russian March" with a number of up to 15,000 people in Lublin, the head of the security department of the capital Alexei Mayorov said today.
This nationalist action has been held every year on National Unity Day since 2005.
When asked by sociologists, “Did you hear that on November 4 Russian marches are held in Russia under the slogans of protecting the rights of Russians in Russia?” three-quarters (75%) of citizens responded negatively.
Currently, only one in five Russians (20%) know about this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010 almost a third of citizens (31%) were heard about the "Russian Marches".
Recall that three years ago, on December 11, a natural meeting of nationalists took place on Manezhnaya Square, which grew into mass riots.
Levada Center also asked the Russians what holiday is celebrated on November 4th.
In two years, the number of those who know the right answer (Day of People’s Unity) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of the citizens are going to celebrate this holiday.
About the same (17%) intend to celebrate the 7th of November the Day of the October Revolution.
The majority of citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How the City of Moscow Agreed "Russian March" in Ljubljana
On October 28, the capital authorities agreed to hold the "Russian March" on November 4 in Ljubljana.
This was reported by the leader of the Russian association, the organizer of the march Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to walking in Ljubljana on the Day of People's Unity, a rally and rock concert of the group "Kolovart" will be held, also agreed with the authorities.
How the "Russian March-2012" went
On the Day of People’s Unity in 2012, the nationalists walked from the Yakimanskaya embankment to the Central House of the artist, where the meeting took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants in 20 thousand people, the Ministry called the figure 6 thousand.
Report: Obama's Pre-Election Staff Considered Biden's Exclusion in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama’s closest advisers secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton’s nomination in the 2012 electoral roll.
This discovery is the most vivid sensation of all the expected books by Mark Galperin and John Haylemann about the 2012 campaign "Stats Doubled: The Game Changed 2012".
The Times received a copy of the book ready for release and reported Thursday evening that the president’s closest aides conducted “large-scale research in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether Biden’s re-election exception could help lift the bill.
According to The Times political reviewer Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempts of high-ranking officials of the pre-election staff and the White House, namely the former head of the administration of the White House, Bill Daley, to assess what effect the election will have on the voters.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded in the Chicago Pre-Election Office and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former chief of Obama’s pre-election staff Jim Messina and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plumf — knew the replacement was under consideration.
The book “The stakes are doubled” claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden despite their “close personal relationship” but ultimately refused this step when their data showed that Clinton’s addition to the electoral list was not “accident.”
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration had indeed considered the possibility of replacing Biden Clinton.
“I was actively speaking for the consideration of a lot of things, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
You have to remember that at the time the president was in terrible shape, so we thought, “Oh my God, what should we do?”
Although Daley characterized the study as a "necessary check", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the pre-election staff had invested enough to see if this move would bring the dividend to the vote.
“The pre-election headquarters don’t spend that much money on surveys and focus groups unless they’re looking at something seriously,” Martin said in the AK 360 program.
It is unclear, however, if Obama knew that his team was studying the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then-boss knew about a possible transfer.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president “was aware” of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration admitted that “possibly” Obama knew.
Martin added that the “doubled stakes” did not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political probe had come to Obama’s table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn’t know about the study of the possibility of excluding Biden from the electoral list.
“Perhaps,” Martin replied.
Do you want a light in the dark of ice cream?
The British entrepreneur created the world’s first ice-cream light in the dark with the help of a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescence properties of the marine animal to develop the luminous food.
He came up with this idea by reading a scientific paper on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the language of the person who eats it, raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that since the ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lizzen me, I'm delicious", says: "It's an amazing thing, but still in the very early stages, when it comes to production, so for <0xC2><0xA3>200 you'll get about 2g of the substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
Therefore, when your mouth heats up protein, it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will begin to glow.
We’ve tested it over the past few months, and it seemed like it would be perfect to introduce it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the luminescence of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So every ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it is quite pleasant to taste.
Charlie’s experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef, and the taste of sour gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to make invisible ice cream.”
This is by definition impossible because of the ice crystals that make up ice, but I think we'll find a way to do that.
Ice cream uses fluorescence properties of jelly, synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Coach "Avangard" Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the match of the regular championship of the KHL against Salavat, noted that the omits conducted a careful analysis of the defeat from the Magnitogorsk "Metallurg".
The specialist stressed that "Avangard" should pay increased attention to the game in defense.
We watched a video of the match against the magnetogorsk "Metallurg", - quotes the official website "Avangard" of the word Chebaturkin.
- We missed a lot of chess, not a very nice moment.
They missed because of their mistakes, because of the failure of the game task.
We knew that the rival had performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks from the walk - three strikes hit us.
Very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account when preparing for today’s game?
“We and the boys understand each game carefully, talk after the game, prepare for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is done.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metalurg.
The game was played and the score was 2:0.
They missed the goal "in the locker room" - and in the third period began to err.
Given how difficult the game was, it didn’t make sense to connect defenders.
We have to defend the whole team.
Now that Avant-Garde has a long home series, matches go through the day - the team has accumulated fatigue?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main thing now is the realization of your moments and the performance of the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you perform the setup - everything is not so difficult.
Due to the new rules introduced by Russian customs, almost a week on the border with Russia, hundreds of furs are in order.
Today, Donetsk officials have promised to provide drivers with drinking water and to install biota toilets.
Hundreds of furs were collected at the border points when entering Russia.
This situation arose due to changes in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officials confirm: in turn, it creates a Russian side, which has not previously warned about the innovations.
Since October 28, the customs authorities of Russia have started to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said Deputy Head of the Eastern Customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document applies to countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Carriage.
Passing points work in an enhanced mode.
The FAKTOV correspondent visited the border and spoke with the long-range fighters who were hostages of the situation.
Prices in the travel shop-café at the point of passage "Novoazovsk" are growing every day, as is the order of the fur.
The trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
The Novoazovsk-Veselo-Voznesenka customs terminal provides one of the most important transport routes from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, the cargo is sent to the Stavropol region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, before midnight, they were still released, and after the introduction of these rules, - complains long-distance fighter Alexey Golovanev (pictured), who takes transit through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and already spends almost a week in his car.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and pay freight insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance to which it is carried.
The minimum insurance is 4,5<0xE2><0x88><0x92>5 thousand rubles (about 1100<0xE2><0x88><0x92>1300 hryvnia).
Those who go near (e.g., to Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo worth up to $50,000, pay somewhere 15 thousand rubles (3,800 hryvnias) and travel.
And the rest are stuck - because no one has that much money with them!
Imagine, if the driver carries the cargo for the amount of only four thousand dollars, but even to Moscow, he needs to pay 90,000 rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnias) for the transit!
The conditions for survival on the border - none, - are set by long-distance fighters, who have arranged to eat near their cars.
In border stores and cafes and so always expensive, but such prices as here, we did not meet anywhere!
The sellers were soorientated and quickly provoked them: 15 hryvnias cost a bottle, seven hryvnias - a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnias - a plate of soup.
And the coffee shop alone.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steps, we go to the toilet.
Not to wash or to wash...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife prepared everything for me on the road.
A week later, another long-distance fighter Viktor Skotarenko consoles himself.
Will my car arrive in a week's time?
Why do you have a half-liter guide? - we are interested in the only border store.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, a bottle of crystal or water insists on silver?
We have a cafe, not a shop.
Take it while you have something else," the seller suggests.
After the situation began to be illuminated in the media, the plight of Ukrainian drivers attracted the attention of the authorities of the region.
The leadership of the Amvrosiev and Novoazov regional administrations have been instructed to ensure all those who are standing in line on the Ukrainian-Russian border, drinking water, - said the executive chairman of the Donetsk regional administration Sergey Dergunov.
Currently, emergency brigades are being deployed at checkpoints.
Biotalets will also be installed for the convenience of people.
According to the official, the problem related to the queues will be solved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk Regional Administration, 32 and 68 cars were parked at the international checkpoints "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk", respectively, as of October 31.
“FACTS” will monitor the development of the situation.
Vilnius Suspects Moscow in Attempt to Blame Lithuanian President
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking Lithuanians and Eastern Partnership countries - such a statement was made to the BNS agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
Information about this is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to "talk" to Lithuanian President Dali Gribauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in Russian Gosarchiv, which relate to facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the preparation of the information attack is carried out by the department of analysis of public processes of administration of the President of Russia on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who has visited Lithuania several times and participated in the Lithuanian People’s Party congress.
Also a participant in the operation is allegedly an employee of the department V. Smirnov.
According to the intelligence service, Smirnov, under the cover of scientific work, visited Lithuania on a regular basis until the end of 2012 and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Smirnov is now banned from entering the country.
The day before, the President of Lithuania Grybauskaite said that she knows about the information that is being prepared for it.
According to her, the main reason is Lithuania’s successful presidency of the Council of the European Union and “the country’s desire for energy independence”
The Lithuanian leader has never once criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she said that in the Kremlin to Lithuania they are “not respectful enough”.
In addition, Grybauskait<0xC4><0x97> accused the head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin in referring to Lithuania “only one requirement”.
In September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian "milk" to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the products does not comply with sanitary-epidemiological norms.
At the time, the Lithuanian leader said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the country’s government should prepare a WTO appeal.
In the U.S., the school principal shot teenagers.
The director of one of the American high schools, the teenagers, literally led to despair.
The man, he said, was forced to take a gun and start shooting.
The incident took place in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, juvenile hooligans threw away a man’s house with toilet paper.
Because of this, the headmaster of the school opened fire on teenagers, resulting in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not on the director's property, he was charged with assault under burdensome circumstances.
The man was released from prison on bail for $125,000.
The shooting of civilians in the U.S. is becoming a terrible routine.
Just the day before, the man opened a shooting in downtown Ridgecrest in the U.S. state of California right on the street.
After that, the criminal captured the hostages of two random passers-by, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to hide.
Earlier in the primary school in Newtown, Connecticut, a shooting was opened.
At school, Adam's mother worked, she was an educator.
Shooting at American school: injured 14-year-old girl
Another shooting incident took place on January 31 at an American school, this time in the state of Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Hallowe'en 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, not to go to bed late and arrange a mascara for our area.
Now I'm more like a duck.
I haven’t been able to put candy in my apartment in the last two years and probably won’t be this year.
However, the statistics show that I am a white-collar when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, the majority of Americans — namely 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that $1.2 billion will go out of the $6.9 billion spent on costumes.
This year, at the peak of fashion, sexual uninspired items.
Women no longer need to be representatives of the sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we’ll see a lot of zombies thanks to Walking Dead, and I’m sure the Daft Punk-style cosmonauts will get into our Instagram videos this year.
According to Google, the costumes they are looking for the most are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There’s probably nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren’t the only ones.
What’s more, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
This means a lot of funny dog-dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don’t bite.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
It’s about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, ice cream, Milk Duds, Twizzlers chewing candy, and Clark Bar.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million children who are preparing to conquer our regions.
What’s more, we’ll buy and — let’s not cheat ourselves — eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don’t want to eat is corn-grain candy; however, according to the National Association of Pastries, nearly <0xC2><0xA3>35 million is sold to Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery I still have to solve.
Nothing so expresses the essence of Halloween as a house of ghosts.
They have amazing names, such as “The Horror Behind the Walls” (which, by the way, is in this prison), “You and the Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
What’s more, according to the American Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized homes in America with ghosts generating about $500 million in revenue, as well as those stunning photos where you almost described what your friend posted on Facebook, and you can’t get rid of that guy, and then you’ll get rid of that guy.
Finally, let’s talk about the ants.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Plains when we were kids, and cutting out Jack's lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, what we've been doing since childhood.
Fortunately for us, the fashion for a child in a teddy bear started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting these teddy bears, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on tobacco this year.
Jack's lighthouse, slowly drying on your wing, is likely to have come from the state of Illinois, which has grown <0xC2><0xA3>542 million this year.
If you want tasks more complicated, visit Tim and Susan Matisdon in the city of Napa, California, and try to cut out some of their scales by 2032 pounds.
Estonian Ministry of Defense website restored after attack by Ukrainian hackers
The work of the website of the Estonian Ministry of Defense is restored after the morning cyber attack, the press service of the ministry reports.
According to Deputy Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense for Information and Administrative Affairs Timer Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the site simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly fixed everything, so far the work of the site has been restored.
“The damage done to the ministry is minimal,” Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it is too early to talk about who organized the attacks.
"We will necessarily analyze the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions from it, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents," he said.
On November 1, the Anonymous Ukraine group placed a call on the network, in which it confirmed the hacker attack on the website of the Estonian Ministry of Defense and spoke against the partnership of Ukraine and NATO.
We want the leadership of NATO to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We must not be servants of NATO.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia.
Ukraine should not be a slave to anyone.
We stand for an independent Ukraine.
"Hands away from Ukraine," Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the mouth of the naval infantry of the Feodosian separate battalion of the Ukrainian naval infantry will take part in the command-and-staff exercises of the reaction forces of NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Due to a storm of unclean force, several schools and hospitals had to be closed.
Four schools in Zimbabwe's southern province of Matabeleland had to close because the students were attacked... goblins.
As the local elder said, the children panicked, and it was impossible to continue the classes.
The story of the goblins may sound like a child’s invention for a European, but in Africa it is quite a serious argument for the closure of the school.
Adults are also afraid of the power of evil.
In the summer, for example, in Zimbabwe, the hospital was closed due to the fact that goblins were also attacked by medical personnel.
The Land Rover racing series has been announced.
Inside are racing seats and hexagonal safety belts, as well as an internal communication system.
In addition, you can get upgraded brakes, a suite of services that provide access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and car storage between events.
Drew Bauler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally participants who turn to Bowler have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced riders, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the tough conditions and realities of the rally rally.
We have been very pleased to develop the Defender Challenge car – it will be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to take part in events in the desert in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian security forces know nothing about the group "Brother Circle" - Novoye Izvestia
This is written by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
“After the media reported that the U.S. Treasury Department had included Leps in the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate ‘Brother Circle’, we looked at all the databases, but no such grouping was found,” the co-debian said.
According to him, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth about the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As previously written "NI", yesterday the U.S. Treasury published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group "Brother's Circle".
Among them was the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He appears on the list as "Gresha", posted the day before.
With the data of the popular Russian performer, they coincide.
The exact name is Grigory Lepsevridze, the creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another from the former USSR, whose citizenship is not indicated.
In the U.S., Grigory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, is convinced that the bandits were carrying money on their orders.
To this message is attached a photo of the singer and all his data, which correspond to the reality.
What’s more, Leps really recently bought a house in Phuket.
The agency noted that they intend to impose sanctions on Lepsa.
The blacklisting of a person by the U.S. Treasury Department entails blocking his assets in the U.S. and prohibiting business contacts with him by individuals living in the United States.
Lepsa's assistant Maya Serikov said that no announcements had been received to the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question of whether it is Grigory, whom everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is media information.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I do not know if they are in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other - surprising and unexpected," she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, in Phuket, Grigory Leps does not live, but, according to the U.S. Ministry of Finance, he does have a house on the Thai island.
She said that now Leps is on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that news stopped him during his flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
A runner in the field in the match "Shinnik"
Some details about the personality of the fan who escaped to the field during the match of the 1/16 final of the Russian Cup between the Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and the Moscow "Spartak" became known.
According to the head of the Russian Federation’s Central Committee, Arthur Grigoryants, referring to the data of the Ministry of Interior, this fan is a Moskvich.
He is currently under arrest.
In addition, Grigoryants told about how the fan managed to break into the field: “It was clear that this, we call it the viewer, passed to the ambulance with two spectators, referring to problems with the heart.
He came to the emergency room, which was confirmed by the doctor.
And then he pushed out two companions and ran to the field.
He ran from the corner of the Eastern and Southern Tribune to the corner of the Eastern and Northern Tribune.
He ran all over the field.
Stewards are responsible for that.
Prior to the entry into force of the sports law, this is the area of action of the stewards - the police can not interfere in what is on the field.
He reached the tribune, passed through the Eastern tribune.
And at this time, riots began on the Eastern Tribune and on the runways,” the head of the KDC said.
Recall that the decision of the KDC Moscow "Spartak" will hold without spectators the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the championship of Russia against "Locomotive" and "Zenita", as well as pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Fire crews were called in to rescue the missing puppy, who was trapped at a height of 50 feet above the ground on a dangerous career retreat.
Cocker Spaniel Ruby Escaped After Getting Into a Small DTP
Three days later, she was stuck in a career, noticed a man walking a dog.
Firefighters came down on a rope on a slope to save the dog from inevitable death
The dog was lucky enough to escape after the fire crews were called in to pick him up and deliver him to a safe place, after he somehow stuck at a height of 50 feet on the dangerous slope of the suspended slope.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cocker spaniel, fled after she got into a car accident on Sunday and spent three days alone before being rescued from a career on Wednesday.
Her owner, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, were at Flappy's career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West York Fire and Rescue Service.
They were feverishly searching for their missing dog and placing calls on social media sites after she ran into a career after a small accident.
At about 14:15 on Wednesday, the star dog driver noticed Ruby, stuck at a height of 50 feet on a retirement career.
The technical rescue team from the Klekchiton fire station rushed to the scene of the incident, descended on the ropes to save Ruby, and used the shuttle to lift her up the slope.
Rescue officer Andy Clayton said: “She was in a dangerous position.”
It was right in the middle of the slope – 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn’t move her muscles during the rescue, she was completely frozen.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate the cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
Rescue team officer Peter Lau said: “Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued.”
There was a chance that she could get a very serious injury or worse.
Rubies were taken to the vet for inspection, and it was found that she was fine, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching the rescue was scary.”
I couldn't believe she was there at all.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The veterinarian said that if she had become obsessed and lost consciousness, she would most likely have fallen.
The fires were great.
It was very brave – what they did.
We are so grateful, and each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson from the city of Ketley added: “We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there.”
The fires were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger Says He Didn't Play With Katy Perry When She Was 18
During an interview on the Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a back-vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker and noted, “He played with me when I was 18.”
She added: “It was a long time ago and he was very good.”
In a statement Thursday, a 70-year-old Jagger spokesman said he “categorically denies that he ever hit on Katy Perry.”
The representative added: “Perhaps she confuses him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevant: The break with Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another horror of independence.
This time we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition of EU membership.
There is a series of stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with a looped wire along Adrian's valley.
However, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movement across Europe, although — predictably — this did not appear in the headlines.
No one has pointed out that EU member states spend a lot of time turning their formal rules the way they feel comfortable.
As Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance will be a cheap concession to Brussels in exchange for what it really wanted from the Scots.
So it's not worth the attention of history.
And so old that it turned into a fossil: for the first time I heard a “flute” that “independence means passport control” at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment lost in the retelling of an ancient fairy tale.
Why should an independent Scotland comply with Europe’s orders at all?
Why change the London yoke to the Brussels yoke, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, the project “Europe” is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties that oppose the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the party of Eurosceptics “Alternative for Germany” – founded only this year – emerged from nowhere and received almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially pushing out the “Free Democrats” (an analogy of our “Liberal Democrats”).
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The austerity measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the loopholes imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency, have led many people to believe that the “Europe” project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are working under excessive budget deficits – it was only fair for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at exchange rates beneficial to German exporters, which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, southern Europe is in a precarious position on production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only way to save is to cut salaries and government spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current problems of the budget and currency are a deeper problem of Europe’s productive capacities.
As a result of the set of “green” energy measures implemented by Brussels – a cipher that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the US.
These are paralyzingly unfavorable price conditions, as we have already seen in the Granjmut.
No wage freezes in the world will stop the crushing victory of cheap U.S. shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
The result is a revolt, especially in France, once the fiercest supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France’s ruined economy in a dire state.
The result – the right-wing anti-EU Marine Le Pen party “National Front” has just won decisive additional elections, dropping the ruling Socialist Party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote — a timely warning to British Labour that it cannot be based on the assumption that a split between the right will automatically turn out in favor of the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly discovered popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If – and this is very likely – the parties against the EU get support in these elections, such a bloc will be able to take the dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
This is my view: soon growing sentiments against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are united to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become something of a flamboyant “Europe (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several of its dependent economies may save the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I suppose the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood that Britain will remain unattended in the cold of the Atlantic.
Where does this leave Scotland? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
We can choose to become a region (in essence) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed in the framework of a more free European agreement provided that we retain our currency.
Cooperation with other single-member countries will be easier in non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating Norway’s experience and maintaining our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party’s government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful political movement in Europe, aimed at countering austerity measures, which received an impressive majority of votes in 2011 due to objections to the reduction in the costs proposed (and implemented) by the Abortion Commission.
Scotland would now be foolish to vote for independence only in order to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sexual maturation: Aging earlier
African-American and Latino-American girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than their white counterparts, according to research.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturation is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers for early sexual maturation.
The tendency to early sexual maturity is not so pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should mothers be afraid if their daughter begins to form the beginnings of the mammary gland and grow forehead hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among American girls and are a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents – it usually doesn’t mean a rapid onset of full sexual maturity,” Kaplovitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, forehead and underarm hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (the first menstruation) over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and decreased from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two to three years before the menarche,” said Kaplovitz, who is also the author of the book “Early sexual maturation in girls: how to deal with this common problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how sexual maturation will progress.
There is a discussion about what constitutes the actual onset of sexual maturity, but is considered “premature” when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or slow down – this is what the pediatrician can closely monitor.
Faster progression may serve as a basis for analysis by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can eventually lead to slowed growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the child's age, level of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplovitz cautioned with drugs, but admitted that “repression of sexual maturity can alleviate behavioral problems and the feeling of girls that they are different from peers.”
Another big problem is clear: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or even how they deal with hygiene issues,” Kaplovitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman, whose daughter began menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many out-of-state theories about the causes of early sexual maturity.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods are to blame, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media.
In boys – as in girls – sexual maturation occurs earlier.
Kaplovitz argues that the condition, which has the most weight, is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years old, which links the amount of fat in the body with the duration of sexual maturation.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latino-American girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than their white counterparts.
There are different explanations.
All over the world, early sexual maturation is likely to affect everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys have hair on their face and forehead at a younger age, the tendency to fully early sexual maturation is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of pimples and pubic hair is found even in infants and children of noble age.
“We need to be careful about how we determine the true onset of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be ashamed to receive instructions from the pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This could mean a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplovitz explained.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early need proof that even when this happens before the laying, this process is a normal part of life.
U.S. Boeing is preparing to take off in Chita
The US aircraft, which carried out observation flights over the territory of Russia under the Open Sky Treaty and made an unscheduled landing in Chita on Friday, November 1, at 8:30 a.m. Moscow time, will leave the city’s airport.
The management of the airport allowed the flight on board, receiving money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan Ude.
According to other reports, he will go to the United States.
As reported, the plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Zabaykal region due to fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita airport.
There are 30 people on board, including the crew, who spent two nights at the airport, reports ITAR-TASS.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, under the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, people on board the aircraft do not have the right to go outside the airport of Chita, they can pass border control only at two airports of Russia - in Cuba and in Ulan Ude.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992, with 34 States participating.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and the countries of Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are the development of transparency, the promotion of monitoring the implementation of arms control agreements, the enhancement of opportunities for crisis prevention and crisis resolution within the framework of the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do deceased celebrities earn - MK in the USA MK
The highest-earning ranking of living celebrities in 2013 was led by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But it was "surprised" by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million.
Notably, he is behind other celebrities who have gone from life to fame, who "earned" several times less last year.
The second in Forbes magazine’s list of the most “constant” gone celebrities by the end of the year was Elvis Presley – 55 million a year, and the bottom line was Peanuts comic book author Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition to them, Elizabeth Taylor, a former leader (25 million) and musician Bob Marley (18 million) were included in the first five.
The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein.

It's not just an office, it's a place where there really is a part of me.
It was with these words that Igor cut the red ribbon and invited all those who wanted... to try the models he looked at!
The manufacturers of jet aircraft are hostile to the width of the seat when large orders are placed on the cone
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers was a heated dispute over the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting a tone for a heated confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers, whose interests are not always at the center of the attention of airlines, while the volume of space allocated to them by the Airbus plays a key role in the air traffic jams.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy-class cabins, but its main U.S. competitor Boeing says that should be decided by the airline.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in the sales of increasingly larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and potentially record orders are expected at the event on November 17-21.
Composing the back of the aircraft – especially whether 9 or 10 people are sitting in a row – is central to the statements about the economic efficiency of new mini-aerobuse projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on more than 17-inch-wide seats in the economy class, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class on 18-inch-wide seats 9-in-a-row.
Aircraft giants are often exchanged for blows on technical issues by means of advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is addressing the public directly in front of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what could be the start of a new advertising war by showing the financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant squeezing at each other, entitled “Would you agree to this?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats that are narrower than regional turboprop aircraft,” said Airbus Sales Director John Lihi.
With the change in diet, people gain weight, but the aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set standards for modern long-haul travel, and at the turn of the century, the weight of an average American male aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average American man of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to statistics from the U.S. health service.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the 1950s seating concept, when the average waist circumference of those who were recently called a “reactive audience” was already.
Airbus says it commissioned a study showing that the extra inch in the width of the seat improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing is challenging Airbus’ seat-size figures and says manufacturers shouldn’t interfere in decisions about how airlines can find a balance between tariffs and conveniences.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the salon depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It’s all really down to giving airlines a choice and an opportunity to do what they think they need to do in order to be successful,” said Kent Creaver, a Boeing saloon specialist.
They do not want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is about increasing the space on the sides, but for suppliers, this is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this dispute is a race for orders for aircraft, estimated at least $700 billion at catatonic prices over the next few decades – enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As the Reuters news agency reported for the first time in July, the location of the seats is precisely what warms the competition in the battle between the newest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing announce a 20 percent increase in profitability to one place in their latest two-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing’s stated characteristics are based in part on the comparison of the 10-seat 777X lines with the original 9-seat configuration of the 777’s design solution lines.
The profit in a particular cost is reduced compared to the 10-seater layout currently in use.
“The reason why Boeing does this is to push more seats and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our designs,” said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus’ passenger comfort division in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that salons with full 10-seater rows for the existing 777s point to the fact that many passengers prefer a dense landing that can go hand in hand with lower fares.
“The eighteen-inch-wide seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ proposal is a threat from the 777th model,” said interior designer Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Traveling around the world, the sellers of jets even take roulette with them to check out the competing plans.
Thanks to the comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very tight layout of the cabin for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a 10-seat A350, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional modifications of the cabins, offering wider seats at the passage on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, her call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “fly,” but may distract from the wave of sales of the 777X.
A new anti-nicotinic vaccine may derail the pleasure smoking process
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could eliminate the process of smoking pleasure cigarettes.
One dose of the vaccine has been able to protect mice from nicotine dependence for a lifetime.
Further tests are needed before the start of the human trials, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystall of Wells Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a strategy to use the vaccine can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to help them overcome it.”
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable stream of antibodies.
Antibodies track any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, who were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And mice that didn’t get the vaccine “relaxed,” and this is a sign that nicotine came to their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines were unsuccessful because they contained antibodies to the vaccine.
In order to maintain high levels of antibodies, the stakes had to be made so often that they turned out to be expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into factories of antibodies.
Professor Crystall said that if a future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they won’t get pleasure from this because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that further research was needed.
Oleynikov: a third of the rural settlements of Podmoskovia fully subsidized
Yury Oleynikov, deputy governor of the Moscow region, said that almost a third of rural settlements in the Moscow region are fully subsidized.
A total of 187 out of 288 households receive funding from the region's budget.
In 2013, 187 of the 288 settlements received grants from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the amount of the budget revenues of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 percent of subsidies.
Within the framework of budgetary security, about 25 billion rubles are sent from the regional budget," Oleynikov said.
The vice-governor also noted that only in three urban settlements - Mytish, Odintsovo and Pushkino - the revenue of the budget is more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, “this is not enough”.
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of Podmoscow is more than 70%, “at the same time there is a decrease in the quality of services”, Oleynikov noted.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of the municipal formations of Podmoscow until the end of November to think about which settlements need to be enlarged, merged into urban districts or changed the system of administrative management.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Prior to this, the governor of the Moscow region said that within the framework of administrative reform in Moscow it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
Also in Mozhai, Kashir, Solnechnogorsk, Kolomensky districts, Luberts and Kotelniks there is a demand for the consolidation of municipalities.
Discussion of this issue in cities and areas of the region will begin in November.
Chairman of the Mosoblduma Igor Brynzalov also said that in the framework of the upcoming adreform, about 30 rural settlements are planned in 12 districts of Podmoscow.
This is due to the fact that out of 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region, less than a third have an “acceptable” financial base, and 100 are subsidized.
Diana Arbenin celebrates Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide the great pleasure she receives from raising her children.
Despite the fact that Arbenin now devotes a lot of time to creativity and social activities, she still finds the opportunity to ride with Martha and Artem, not only spending time on their training, but also entertaining as much as she can.
Over the past week, Diana has told her fans twice about her pedagogic talents.
She first posted a photo on Facebook, which shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday she talked to the fans, showing how she dressed Artem and Martha on Halloween.
Ready to race on the broomsticks! our first Halloween" - so named Diana a photo of her children dressed in festive costumes.
Which is unwise, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, have something to do with this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany is the first in Europe to introduce ‘uncertain sex’ when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to indicate “uncertain” when registering children born with hermaphrodites instead of male or female gender.
The parents of the child will have the right for a while to leave the count "sex" in the birth certificate unfilled.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (male) parents can record "X" (indeterminate) for a while.
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents to hurry up with an operation to “clarify” the gender.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermaphrodite.
Tripod denies being under the influence of Obadiah
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be a key figure in the state’s anti-corruption supervisory body’s investigation.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied making changes to the order of leases of offshore facilities at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned shares in three real estate properties on state land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obaid has lobbied several state ministers to extend the lease to Cerc<0xC3><0xBA>lar Ki, where the Obaidov family owns two restaurants and cafes, without passing a tender in 2005 after their stint.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obaid's secret involvement in real estate, following statements made by the former Deputy Head of the Tripodi Administration, Mr. Lynn Eshpaul, on Thursday.
Over the course of several years of discussions, which began in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be exposed to open competition.
The tenants were against this, and also wanted longer lease terms.
In 2009, the contracts for the lease of enterprises to Cerkular Ki, which brought the Obeidov family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without exposure to open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally in favour of open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, strongly advised to make changes to the government's rental policy.
The telephone call deciphered by the ICAC included conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dann, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obaid in the Department of Fisheries.
“Was the question discussed during these telephone conversations the issue of the development of commercial lease policy?” asked Commissioner Anthony Willy’s assistant, Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” said Mr. Tripodi.
I can’t remember what was being discussed, but that was definitely not the case.
It's definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to a senior official, Israeli military jets are attacking targets inside Syria.
A senior administration official in an interview with Fox News confirmed that Israeli military aircraft struck a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official did not specify that it was intended, but said that at least one.
"Associated Press" reports that the goal was the missiles of Russian production SA-125.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out airstrikes on cargo with missiles inside Syria.
Foreign workers on subclass 457 visas can be tested for “truth”
The “truth” test for foreign workers on Class 457 visas is under consideration by the government as it intends to expand repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied in accordance with the criteria aimed at preventing the use of a Class 457 visa to fill unqualified positions or as a leash for moving family and friends to Australia.
The document, presented by the government for discussion, was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McQueen criticized the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“The ugly statements like ‘Foreigners — Finally in a Row’ and ‘First Work for Australians’ represent a very unpleasant setback to the times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white labor needed to be protected – and if some in the region saw the echoes of this historical artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The present document sets out 12 measures that were previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets with officials on human trafficking, has already made five of the recommended changes, and the rest are in the review stage.
If the criteria of “authenticity” are accepted, the applicant for a visa can be examined for the purpose of “whether the candidacy is genuine in circumstances where the candidate is a relative or close familiar owner or person with a financial relationship with the enterprise”.
Businesses may also be required to report on the number of holders of visas of subclass 457, as previously enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of workers were then hired by hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man’s nine-year-old son was accompanied by him on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death on Wednesday is supported by a twin brother who was also on board the ship.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A friend of Semena Varlamova said that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of hockey player Semen Varlamov Evgeny Vavrinyuk said that he suffers from alcoholism, the Russian News Service reports.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” the woman said, in particular.
Recall that Vavrynyuk filed in court for beating Russian goalkeeper Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the club "Colorado".
According to her, the hockey player pulled her out of her hair, as well as beaten - after the attack, her hands, chest, stomach and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came with the culprit to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what happened.
He was arrested, but later released on bail for $5,000.
The court did not restrict the athlete to travel around the country, but banned him from approaching Vavrynyuk.
He is also threatened with imprisonment for up to six years for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
HS2 Project Presupposes Opening of High-Speed Communication with Scotland and Northern England, with the Start of the First Stage in 2026
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “will unite the UK”.
Scotland’s Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “excited” about the prospect of working on a plan with the UK government.
The first stage will be the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the Second Stage is completed, the lines will be laid out in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has ordered HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in the railway’s throughput capacity and reducing the duration of travel for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of crossing the road from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal on HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a crisis of transit capacity in our rail network.
But it’s also about transporting cities to each other; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get the best message thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael “unanimously” to support Scotland’s inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds Scotland’s economic weight to the overall argument for the high-speed railway across the UK.”
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the UK Government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway line, which is already being planned by the Scottish Government.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British ministers next year and to taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Is Tory a New Hope for Nuclear Energy?
Governments in countries around the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative effect on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for the generation of energy.
Atomic energy is without one and the other, but leaves behind a lot of expensive in the disposal of waste.
Recently, scientists have paid attention to the tories - another radioactive element of the Mendeleyev system.
It is found all over the world, and, according to experts, its disintegration does not leave the waste that must be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia for as long as they remain in force
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite U.S. measures to mitigate the rules regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during take-off and landing provided they remain in “Flight Mode.”
Passengers can already do so during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required U.S. airlines to do a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they are considering the statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of the flight are still in effect in Australia.
“Civil aviation flight safety management currently does not have special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” it said.
This issue is governed by the rules that require air carriers to ensure safety at any time, and passengers to comply with the safety rules that are communicated to them by the crew members.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Administration the expansion of its Wi-Fi entertainment system, was not against the changes, but said it would follow the regulator’s instructions.
“We would welcome consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Administration of the issue of allowing the use of electronic devices, because we really think this will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the on-board wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft,” the press release said.
Qantas said it would abide by the rules currently in force.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and in the near future we do not plan to change it,” she said.
The FAU’s ruling applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully study the decision of the FAU and the reasons that caused it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to prove that their aircraft have resistance to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as review the facilities, training materials, rules on the carriage of hand luggage and instructions for passengers.
“After the airline checks and confirms the interrelationship of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, e-books and smartphones, at any height,” the FAU said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will give instructions to the passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group ' s recommendations, heavier devices should be located under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
Heads of Dagestan are heard in an anthem of Cuban notes of extremism
The match between Anji and Kuban resulted in a political clash between the authorities of the Krasnodar region and Dagestan after supporters burned the Dagestan flag, and the Kubani anthem sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov on Thursday suggested to Republican parliamentarians to go to court because the Krasnodar region gymnasium allegedly calls for inter-ethnic discord, in particular, calls for a war with the “basurmans”.
Take an anthem of the Krasnodar region, it was in our time in 1995 that this anthem was approved.
This is a shame, and no one is doing it.
"Remembering you here as the mother of the native, the enemy, the basurmanina, we are going to the battle of death" - for which such words are recorded in the anthems, to poison some believers on other believers, - expressed solidarity with the President of the Parliament of Abdulatippi Hizri Shikhsadovi.
Putin gets impunity for his friend, Assad
And now - the news because of the ocean, namely - from Syria, where, as we became aware today, Israel struck missiles of Russian production, which, according to reports, were intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy its chemical weapons production by November 1.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached under the mediation of Russia and allowed the United States not to conduct a military operation, to which they have approached in full this summer.
More about the weapons and what all this means for the Syrian president, our chief international correspondent, Richard Engel, will tell us.
Washington said the Assad regime would be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were killed in August by the poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal, which was arranged by a friend of Assad - Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had dismantled the claimed factories for the production of chemical weapons.
A more long-term and difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and components to it.
As we understand it is about a thousand tons.
Washington has previously said that the days of Assad are numbered.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether this will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and needs to leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some people have to feed on leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad has evaded punishment for mass murder.
The agreement on chemical weapons is called the success of diplomacy, inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself made the impression of a man ready to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the U.S. ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of hunger, his mother is unlikely to be easier than not being killed with chemical weapons.
Assad is still standing.
They change their weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation established a separate Ministry of Construction and Civil Engineering
Russian President Vladimir Putin has set up a new ministry that curates construction and HQ issues and proposed to head his former governor of the Ivanovo region Mikhail Menu in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Mena at his residence in Novo-Ogarevo, and Mena did not refuse to head the new department.
The press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov explained that all the functions related to construction and the HQ are transferred to the new ministry from the Minregion.
Mikhail Mena, the son of the famous Orthodox priest Alexander Mena, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petroleum Chemistry named Gubkin.
Since 1995 began his political career - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from Sergievo-Posadskyi district, was a deputy of the State Duma, the first deputy prime minister of the Moscow region government, the deputy prime minister of the Moscow government.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Mene served as governor of the Ivanovo region.
The owners of the lombards in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
Janani Amirthaling sets a gold bracelet, ring and earrings at the Bendemir shopping mall in Singapore to pay for her daughter’s school education.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money was put in there,” says Mrs. Amirthaling.
Although she earns $3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, the demand in various parts of Southeast Asia — where the volume of household debt is growing — is such that ValueMax, where it conducts its transaction, this week became the third lobster to be registered on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
A mortgage on jewelry is not only a quick way to get money (S$1300 in Mrs. Amirthaling’s case), but also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Singapore’s lombards typically charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% – just above the 15.4% offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same trading center.
However, Lombards have the advantage that they do not require creditworthiness checks or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks.
That’s why millions of people across the region are turning to Lombards, as families feel pressured by rising cost of living and rapid growth in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis, and cheap loans fueled by free money-credit policies in developed-economy countries, low- and middle-income families are turning to cash to make up for the cost of living.
This week, Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, pointed to an increase in the family’s credit score, mainly due to mortgage growth, as a risk factor for Asian banks’ creditworthiness.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared with 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week barely came out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed a continued decline in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that as prices rise, people in the middle and lower parts of the [income scale] will be looking for ways to replenish their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Won, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
A record high price of gold over the past two years has boosted the rush with which people place their personal belongings, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items placed in the city-state’s 200 checkpoints are gold items.
People say, “The price of gold looks good, let’s put on the grandmother’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
In Thailand, the largest operator of EasyMoney has seen an increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in the lumber business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemire and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside of Asia, says Yeah Lee Cheng, CEO of ValueMaix.
The company will fund the expansion, using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of stock placement on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have sparked criticism due to high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says that the Lombard not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, it also does not increase the debt directly.
“Clients place items that they already own, and monetization of personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
The institution is gaining wider public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
And at the same time, Lombards do not only benefit those categories of people who are in a difficult financial position.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax offices, laying gold bars or Rolex watches that can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include wealthy people who need to borrow money for a short time for commercial projects or investments, or small business enterprises that need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number of existing medical institutions and their status that is important to the population, but the quality of medical care.
The implementation of the program "Modernization of health care of the Tula region for 2011 - 2013"., the reorganization of the medical institutions of our city will allow to create an optimal structure for the provision of medical assistance to the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant women and midwives.
So, after joining with the hospital, there was an even greater opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the GAZ "NGKB" for consultations of pregnant women with various pathologies, to conduct additional examinations at the base of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the material and technical base of the maternity home was significantly improved, modern equipment appeared, corresponding to the world standards.
During these years, about 8 million rubles were allocated for the capital repair of the premises, 112 units of equipment for the amount of 42 million rubles were purchased.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
In the operation of the caesarean section is used the apparatus "Sell-Sever", which allows to collect blood from the surgical wound and after special treatment to return her uterus, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
The department of clinical-laboratory diagnostics is also equipped with modern equipment.
In the female consultation, there is an electronic registration, in the near future it is planned to introduce electronic maps and history of the disease of patients.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it was possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, newborns and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Chechnya's natives are arrested by French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March of this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
It is reported that the bandits ordered a prostitute to one of the hotels in Strasbourg, and then beat them and kidnapped them.
The leader of the gang was a 27-year-old previously tried native of Chechnya.
Bavarian defender David Alab<0xC3><0xA1> became Austria’s best athlete in 2013, according to the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he outperformed representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by the skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third - a ski jump from the trampoline Gregor Schirenzauer.
Last season, a 21-year-old Filipino-Nigerian Austrian helped his team win the Champions League, the Championship and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
The ex-wife of Arshavin rests with actor Andrei Chadov
Former civilian wife of football player "Zenit" Andrey Arshavin Yulia Baranovskaya is on vacation together with actor Andrey Chadov.
Yulia rests in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zadorozhnay, her husband - the figure of Sergey Slavnov, and the actor Andrey Chadov.
Photos from the joint walks of the couple are published on Instagram Anastasia Zadorozhnaya.
This is not the first joint photo of Andrea and Julia.
On October 5, Zadorozhnaya published a photo in which the couple stands on the shores of the Gulf of Finland in Komarov.
In mid-October, Zenit’s hubby Andrey Arshavin admitted that he lives separately from his civilian wife Yulia.
Yulia Baranovskaya and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
It has recently become known that Arshavin meets ex-model Alisa Kazmin.
Arshavin's new girlfriend was married to the corporation's top manager.
A $325 million package of rescue measures for health care in Tasmania
The federal government insists that a $325 million package of rescue measures for Tasmania’s weakened health care system will be complemented by tough conditions that ensure the state government will not spend empty-handed.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking “prompt measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the aging population of this island state, higher levels of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The funding decision was made within four years after the government's consultation with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilka.
“The government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state,” Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million per flash campaign for planned operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedics and cataract removal operations, will help overcome the lag.
There is also money for clinics accepting patients without prior registration, in Hobart and Lonsestone, to improve the quality of care after the intern, training medical professionals, mental health services, and introduction of personal electronic health card systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will go to the stated advanced doctors to implement ideas on how to better help Tasmania’s health care system,” Ms. Plibersek said.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would work in strict reporting and accountability.
The State will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Community funds, and to report monthly on where it spends those additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilki said today that $325 million will not solve anything unless they follow a genuine reform that will put Tasmania’s healthcare system on a more sustainable footing.
However, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first addressed the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to the conclusion of the state’s health care system from a critical point of view,” Wilka said.
According to the State Government, these additional electoral procedures are largely compensating for recent reductions.
But the federal opposition health representative Peter Dutton believes that today’s statement is a “solution similar to a leukoplasty.”
“The reason we’re here is that the Labor government has cut $430 million from the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
When the state government deducts almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, it can’t pretend to be good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar in the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The screenplay by Guy Nick of the novel Danny Diderot may boast an exceptional staging and historical details, but it is also more difficult to perceive than it should be.
The film, which takes place in France in the 1760s, tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat sent to the monastery by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty from the hands of the sadist-in-waiting and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to vanity or sensation—and that’s the whole problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the narrative risks becoming a test like a diaper and for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its means of making chemical weapons, says the monitoring group
Syria has destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and gas-poisoning munitions, an international monitoring group said on Thursday, while fierce clashes were raging in the north of the country, close to one of the sites, where, as reported by Reuters, they are located.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the country’s civil war almost three years ago.
A statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
the deadline of November 1, established by this Hague-based organization, in order for Damascus to destroy or “make incapacitated” all means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms enabling it to mix chemical substances with the production of poisonous gas and beeswax.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious schedule, which aims to destroy all of Damascus’ chemical weapons by the middle of 2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, is yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The statement was made during the fierce fighting on Thursday in the city of Safir, which experts say is an object for the production of chemical weapons, as well as the location of its storage, the British-based Syrian Center for Human Rights said.
The group of activists, which tracked the loss through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6365 children.
On the part of the government, the group said 29,954 people are members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah fighters.
Also among the dead, as stated in the statement, were 2,022 military defectors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to a UN estimate of 25 July, 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad’s forces fought rebels in Safir for several weeks, many of whom are affiliated with al-Qaida groups.
The Center said on Thursday there were casualties from both sides, but did not provide specific data.
The fighting underscored the danger that chemical weapons inspectors are facing in the midst of the ongoing civil war, which is set by the tight deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of a toxic arsenal.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, said that its team was “now satisfied with the fact that it had checked and destroyed all critically important means of production and equipment for mixing/fuelling claimed by Syria.”
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently being planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspection work by visiting 21 of the 23 facilities claimed by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said both sites were, according to Syria's statement, "displaced and ... the chemical weapons program items in them have been moved to other claimed sites that have been verified."
It was not immediately possible to find out if the facility in Safir was one of two places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” Ahmet Uzumji, Director General of the Observation Group, said in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has been facing insurgents, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad government and its security forces, which are members of its Alawite sect, the renunciation of Shiite Islam.
As for other events, the head of the Rami Abdurrahman Center said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at the air defense facility in Syria’s coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over the condemnation of the organisers of the attack in Bali
The 202 survivors and relatives who died as a result of the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted angrily to the sentence handed down to the last of the conspirators who appeared before the court and said Umar Patek should be shot.
The trail, which has spent nearly 10 years running as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for its role in creating explosive devices used during the attack.
It may be released within 15 years if it receives a conditional early release.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass killings as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, during which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church explosions across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a person called a “spinner” for his reputation as a master of explosive devices, should be sentenced to death.
This decision aggravated the painful memories of Perth's mother, John Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices nearly ten years ago.
Hardly holding back her tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He should be in front of the firing squad,” said Mrs. Kortin AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing I don’t have grandchildren anymore and I don’t see my daughters anymore.”
The club "Sari" was destroyed when a massive explosive device placed in a parked outside van was put into operation immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack made of explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After this attack, he fell into a coma for a month and “died” three times, being connected to the life insurance system.
Mr. Hughes said that the Pathek should share the participation of three other members of the Jemaa Islamia terrorist cell responsible for the bloody battle, Amrozi, Muhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.
To save his life, well, there's no reason to save his life.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds is not so much.
Patek is the last of the participants of the attack in Bali presented to the court.
He hid for nearly a decade, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. troops killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent showed that the intelligence data was evidence: Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to restore ties between the terrorist groups of South East Asia and Al Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he had no regrets about how much grief he had caused to other people.
The sentence was handed down on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” says Mrs. Cortin.
The defendant may still appeal his sentence.
FAU: “Air passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes (but not call from mobile phone)”
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones – according to the long-awaited new guidelines, published in the Official Journal.
However, passengers should not expect changes to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, FAU administrator Michael Warta said at a press conference.
The airlines will have to show the FAU how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their training allowances for flight crew members and device layout rules to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAU said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already presented plans.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAU said.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain will not give "good".
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane is down for landing and do not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and take-off, the FAU said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified in such a way that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Board Conductors, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy is successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option,” Glading said.
We’re frankly tired of feeling “school-aged” when it comes to this issue.
But connecting to the Internet for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data will still be banned at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
Thus, there is still no “Words with Friends” — an intellectual internet game in which actor Alex Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when a suspected case occurred: the actor was removed from the plane by American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device at the time.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be put in the luggage compartment, as they can hurt someone if they fly all over the salon.
Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also still be banned.
Regulatory powers over telephone calls belong to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU.
FAU may remove the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Council, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones are still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they potentially can create interference for navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FKS that they can create interference for cell communications when the aircraft is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee, set up by the FAU to study the issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAU has increased in order to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, argue that there are no strong security-related grounds for the ban.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAU began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference to navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radio receivers – high-tech gadgets of the time.
The new airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also being developed and approved by the FAU as resistant to electronic interference.
The airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for several years now.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are adapted for wider use of electronic devices according to new guidelines, Warta said.
Today’s electronic devices usually emit radio signals that are much lower in power than previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading e-books, for example, emit only minimal signals when scrolling through pages.
But the signals become more powerful when the devices download or send the data.
Among those who sought to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded an entire airliner with their devices to read Kindle e-books and flew on it to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of devices poses any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Air Passengers said he believes the interference from the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only separate messages from pilots confirming that the devices can create disruptions to aviation systems, and most of those messages are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAU allow pilots to require passengers to turn off the devices while boarding the devices under limited visibility conditions.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a healthy step towards passengers who are now using a host of technological devices.
“We are pleased that the FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and protection,” said Roger Doe, Director General of the U.S. Tourist Association.
Car schools will be able to conduct exams for obtaining driving rights
Driver's license examinations will be able to take private companies with their own computerized autodrome.
This is what Kommersant writes about with reference to the draft government decree "On the admission to vehicle management".
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such autodromes in Russia.
It is assumed that students of such "privileged" schools will take into account the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the Gosavtoinspection will monitor the examinations every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the exams in theory and more than 20% of the site students do not give up for the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for the autodromes contained in the draft Government resolution shall enter into force from 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for training to drive two-wheeled vehicles.
From January 1, 2015, the owners of motorcycles to obtain category A rights will have to pass the exam in urban traffic conditions.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers will have to receive Russian rights after passing the exam.
A bird that has been left in the air to a safe place from a drilling rig in the North Sea has been released back into the wild
The bird, which was thrown into the air on the shore after being found in a depleted state at an oil slick in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
This water cow was placed in a helicopter headed to Aberdeen last month, and then was released by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at the rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, the center’s manager, said: “This waterfowl is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has fallen into a zone of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird has become obsessed and has been able to find refuge at the oil ridge.
He added: “She was unable to fly again, so they appealed to us for help.”
The watery duck was healthy and in good condition by the time it was released.
Is the elite of Europe ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to gather business representatives and determine what changes the UK’s wealth and jobs creators want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we have ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of businesses in the UK by size, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently looking for export opportunities outside of Europe, paying special attention to countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are in stagnation.
They want the government to give priority to new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spending time on a long and difficult process of reforming the EU’s confused institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, and business representatives stated that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the advantages of being in the trading zone of Europe, — even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most profitable.
The latest and most notable is our survey of business leaders revealed that the clear majority wants the UK to take a course on treaty change and EU relations based on trade rather than policy.
This result, which has been observed among businesses of all sizes and major business groups, shows that the business is insisting on a “significant change” that will return powers back to the UK.
High rates – achieving changes in the treaty and more favourable conditions for the UK will ensure a 16 percent shift in the vote to stay in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British business supports his plan to revise the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business expects that the overhaul will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back toward the UK.
The best conditions for British business are possible and are becoming more and more necessary as the euro area embarks on a path of closer economic and financial union.
The priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and, as the results of our survey show, for business this means increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels’ regulatory activities.
U.S. special services are listening to Pope's personal phone
The Vatican’s activities are under the watchful control of U.S. intelligence agencies.
The new documents from Edward Snowden’s collection testify that U.S. intelligence conducted a hearing of all the negotiations of former Pope Benedict, and is now closely guarded by Pope Francis.
His phone started ringing before he became the head of the Vatican.
The process of the election of the new pope was also under observation.
Which in the U.S. was of particular importance.
The special service connected to the cell phones of the cardinals who gathered in Rome to choose the next pope.
Telephones of the residence where the participants of the conclave lived were also heard.
American spies listened to all the main contenders for the papal throne to prevent the appearance of an undesirable figure for Washington.
The magazine Panorama writes that the “big ear of the United States” continued to intercept prelate talks until the very end of the conclave on March 12.
It is claimed that in the United States since 2005 the Argentine Archbishop Bergolio has been appointed as the future Pope of Rome.
U.S. intelligence also tracked negotiations related to the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives is still working at the U.S. Embassy in Rome to gather information about policies and financial flows.
The Vatican, in turn, has peacefully announced that it does not care about the American "hearing", even if it does.
From the leadership of the United States, the Holy Fathers have no secrets.
The snowboarder for the Olympic coin was specially photographed
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a commemorative note dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The price of the ticket is 100 rubles.
But in the network, bloggers are already actively ironing about a commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic bill on October 30, they paid attention to the fact that the image of a snowboarder from a banknote can be found in photobanks.
In particular, in the free stock photo store StockExchange, where this photo was dated in 2005.
The same photo is used in a lesson on Photoshop, published on the Russian website "Megaobzor" on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in the advertising of RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic banknote is made in a blue-blue gamma.
On one side is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other side is a view of the Olympic Stadium and the Hot Bird.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named Repin.
The presentation noted that several types of sport were considered - ski, freestyle and jumps from the trampoline, but in the end they chose a snowboard, as it is a relatively young sport.
According to Izvesty, a source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the public opinion about the widespread spread of the image of a snowboarder with an Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
And here in Goznac are not too worried about the noise around the Olympic banknote.
Head of the press service of the State Sign Natalia Nikiforov told "Izvestia" that all the arguments regarding plagiarism are ridiculous.
A snowboarder on the banknotes turned right, in the photos on the net - on the left," Nikiforova said.
The person in the photo session to create the bill was filmed from different points, then the final image was selected, on it - the characteristic position of the snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to Olympic banknotes, as the artist received a salary for the work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic coin is quite positive.
The recognition of the image on the bill - plus for its promotion, - considers the executive director of NPP "RusBrand" Alexei Popovichev.
It is quite difficult to prove a hundred percent similarity of images on the bill and in photobanks, so the claims to challenge the intellectual property of this image are unlikely to come.
For the first time, an Olympic banknote appeared in China - a commemorative note of 10 yuan was issued at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Lawsuits have forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian breweries have a bad mood.
According to them, the country’s beer consumption next year will remain at the previous level, and that’s at best.
Businesses were initially looking for growth.
After all, this year is failing for them: sales have fallen by 7 percent.
The head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, the chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps, told about all this at the 3rd annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute “Goods of Daily Demand in Russia”, which has just ended in Moscow.
It discussed the state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already decreased by 18 percent, as in recent years there has been a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of the production and circulation of beer - a drink with low alcohol content, - told listeners Sheps.
No country in the world has such a severe restriction on the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of all new and new illogical bans, which are based on the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer insisted that many legislative bans designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse do not have a particular impact, however, all new initiatives are constantly emerging.
The most painful thing about beer producers has hit the ban introduced since this year to sell alcohol in kiosks.
“We immediately lost 35,000 consumers,” Isaac Sheps said.
Next year, breweries have two forecasts.
Optimistic - the one that Sheps talked about: the sales of the foam drink will remain at the previous level.
Pessimistic - will fall another 2-3 percent.
In order to keep their profits, businessmen are forced to leave the varieties designed for the mass consumer, in the class of "premium": beer will be less, but it will be more expensive.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are yet to be seen.
"According to my observations, the level of alcoholism diseases remains at about the same level," said narcologist Alexey Sotnikov.
True, the proportion of patients using strong drink surrogates has grown, as well as those who have “simmered” on alcohol-containing tonics such as “Yaguara”, while ten years ago, alcoholism prevailed.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford car plant in Vsevologsk.
As they say in trade unions, all the fired have been compensated.
However, far more acute than the problems of the workers, the question of the reduction of production in the region arises.
The deputy of the regional ZakSa Alexei Etmanov said at the meeting that about 600 people were reduced at the Ford company plant in Vsevologsk.
According to him, this happened in September: then about 600 people left the plant under a voluntary lay-off program, which was developed together with the trade union of the organization.
Workers who decided to resign on their own will were offered "golden parachutes" in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the overwhelming majority left the jobs of their own free will.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's going to be limited.
However, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programs to support regional enterprises in a difficult situation in the next two years," he said, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and a large reduction in jobs.
In Ford, this information is not denied or confirmed.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will be sure to publish it.
Talks about the reduction of workers at the Ford plant in Vevolozhsk have been going on for a long time.
So, for example, the company’s plans to fire 600 people became known in September.
Earlier, the plant announced the suspension of the production of cars.
As a reason, the plant was called the fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, after nine months of 2013 the volume of industrial production in Lenoblast decreased by 5.4%.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
In the U.S., mobiles can be used during take-off and landing of aircraft
The new rules for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing are approved in the United States, according to the BBC.
It is expected that U.S. airlines will allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, and the new rules will come into effect by the end of 2013.
However, the Internet connection to receive and send e-mail will be prohibited during flights at an altitude of less than 3 kilometers.
Due to the danger of interference with the radio equipment of aircraft, cellular voice communication will still be banned.
Thus, passengers of the aircraft will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets, and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of the use of electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the federal administration of U.S. civil aviation that they are able to cope with the supposed impact of mobile on aircraft engineering and aircraft management devices.
According to the source, for example, in the United States, the current rules for using electronic devices in flights will also be revised in the UK.
For the "Russian mafia" in the US finally secured a new name - "Brother's Circle"
This week, the blacklist of the “Russian mafia” in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Treasury Department introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli into the “Brotherly Circle”.
One of the Russians turned out to be the famous singer Grigory Leps, whom the United States suspects in the transportation of money for members of the group.
In total, the U.S. blacklist includes 22 people who are part of the Brotherhood and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts have expressed doubts that such an organization actually exists.
"The claim of the 'Brother' Circle is more of an attempt to unite different criminal groups," said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and a professor at the University of New York.
In his opinion, the "Brother's Circle" reflects the popular perception of the "Russian mafia".
“I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,” said Galeotti, the US Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti is also a professor at George Mason University, Liz Shelley.
“If they act together, it’s more like a criminal network, but not an organization,” the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime said in a statement.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the “Brother’s Circle” brings together most of the close-knit Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandpa Hasan.
Criminal authorities were killed in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zakaria Kalashov, who completed the list in 2012, were closely related to grandfather Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, came to grandfather Hassan as a nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some persons are not related to Usoyan.
In his view, they were all united rather by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the "Brother's Circle" of Grigory Leps - the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin - attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Of course, we expect that we will get more detailed information from our American partners, in connection with which such a decision was made, why it was entered in such lists, - said the press secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
Head of Gazprom Alexey Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sphere
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
“Today there was a significant event: the construction of the Bulgarian gas pipeline “South Stream”, the largest and most important project in Europe, began,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The "South Stream" is designed to diversify Russia's export routes through Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which contains a large portion of Russia’s gas destined for Europe, raises the level of risk for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said a direct link with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were eliminated “forever.”
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the "South Stream" at a reduced price, as soon as the entire project begins to work in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries located further along the gas pipeline route by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning in Saratsky district, the driver of the Peugeot car went to the meeting line on 115 km of the Odessa-Reni route, and faced a bus in which six people were in.

Two YMCA employees have been charged with sexual offences even before charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission has become known.
Two employees of YMCA NSW were charged with sexual crimes against children until charges were brought in 2011 against an employee of Jonathan Lord's Children's Care Facility in Karingbach, the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children reported.
But the commission’s opening statement said it had “never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization.”
Philip Hayer, chief executive, was asked about one case when a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography-related crimes, and another case when a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assaults against children in 1991.
Mr. Hayer told Gale Fern<0xC3><0xA8>s, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.
He admitted that the YMCA in the opening speech to the commission also admitted inaccuracy, claiming that “there were external YMCA checks that acknowledged that YMCA is at the forefront of child safety.”
The evidence commission said that the YMCA had been notified that it had received the second of four possible evaluations at the end of the quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hayer, who joined the YMCA when he was 21 years old, acknowledged that he and the lower management had failed in hiring Lord and had not been able to provide a clear understanding of their obligations to staff regarding reporting violations of children's security policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during two years of his work at YMCA.
He was jailed for at least six years.
But Mr. Hayer rejected the assumption that YMCA’s corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations in the field of child safety.
The employees gave evidence that they had observed violations, including that the Lord was alone with the children, cared for them personally, put them on his knees, said that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the leadership of Lord and asked to train her to protect the children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she found Jackie Barnat, a childcare manager at YMCA in Karingbach, who was a "caregiver and caregiver" of Lochga.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept an explanation from the staff that it was uncomfortable for them to report the situation to their senior managers.
Rather, according to him, their friendship with Lord led them away from the thought of the need to report about him.
Mr. Hayer said he presented to the YMCA Council of New South Wales his opinion that the lesson for the organization from the “Jonathan Lord incident” was not “in terms of providing information” by employees, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hayer said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations were made by YMCA’s Director General for Child Care Liam Whitley.
He said it was meant to prevent a breach of evidence, but at the same time they were “overworked” and this decision was poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not safe for children by the organization during its work with Jonathan Lord in the period 2009–2011, according to the committee’s Child Breeding Expert, Professor Steven Smolbown of Griffith University.
He said there were “serious problems” in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and controlling staff.
The hearings were postponed until December 20.
A fashion week in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
She is considered not just a manoeuvrator in her homeland, but a real star.
Despite the fact that Giselle B<0xC3><0xBC>ndschen left her job for a while, having fun with her motherhood, these days and this week she came to the show specifically.
The long absence did not prevent her from keeping her place on the podium and on the pedestal.
Gisele remains the highest-paid supermodel in the world.
This time she participated in the parade of the brand "Kol<0xC4><0x8D>chi".
The final of the fashion week is usually the most interesting shows.
It's like being organized by the stylist Lino Villaventura.
For more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of the luxury pre-a-port, the model works actively in theatre and cinema, designing shows and developing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, in the final week of fashion in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo, more than 30,000 firms and companies that are relevant to the textile industry and the fashion world took part.
It is one of the most dynamically developing areas of production, employing more than 2 million Brazilians, and the annual turnover reaches 50 billion dollars.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but admitted that the return was unlikely.
In an interview on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, a 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various aspects of domestic politics in the evening.
Since retiring in June 2007, after ten years as a leader, Blair has largely avoided discussions of British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Middle East peacekeepers.
Asked whether he would return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said: “Yes, of course, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so...”
The head coach of Milan, Massimiliano Allegri, expressed regret about the result in the match of the 10th round of the Italian championship with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failures at the start are due to a series of injuries of the leading players.
“I’m very sorry we didn’t win,” Tmw said.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good chances.
In the first half, we didn't let anything happen to Lazio.
In the second Romans were added, but in general I cannot say that we have lost concentration.
We had to win.
Last season, we performed the task of getting into the Champions League.
We are now behind schedule, but this is due to a whole series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
They are very good players, with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Take a look at the Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
Experts of consportive events, congregating in Cardiff to fight for the award of "The Horse of the Year", knew that the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the appearance of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before he took his first steps, this little boy with his pet Shetland pony Toffey russia swam through three laps to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far away.
This inseparable pair – of equal growth – received high ratings for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition held by the Sannibenk Horse Sports Center in the city of Radry near Cardiff.
Having gone out to public view against the background of men and women in fine hats-bottles, he moved his cap up and proudly spent two-year-old Toffee's circle.
The judges praised Fenton for his not over the years developed innate abilities to deal with horses.
And Toffee was highly regarded for her appearance and character.
Fenton was given to Toffee for his third birthday in March of last year, and since then he has been dealing with Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: “Fenton and Toffee are a wonderful duo.”
They had a lot of rivals, but these two went with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second performance with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely unfamiliar people in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, which is not far from Abbeville in South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howels, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “The whole audience was shocked, and everyone was screaming with approval and banging.”
He ran across the sand along the length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did a great job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens that he cares about.
Judging by how he started, he will soon be taking part in the “Loshad of the Year” – and I’m sure he will perform well.
A representative of this annual horse show said: “Fenton only has three years, but he knows how to deal with his ponies.”
Together they are a great team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffee for their appearance and for how they presented themselves on the show-ring.
They appreciate the harmony of the pony and the breeder - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
China's newspaper's appeal "should be reorganised"
The Chinese newspaper, which published in the first column a call for the release of the accused in the whistleblower’s complaint, should be reorganized, the press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based newspaper New Express made an unexpected public statement with a request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes for writing fake articles about a company with a state-owned stake.
Now the “New Express” has to go through the “process of complete error correction”, as the regulator reports.
The order for the “correction of errors” came from the Guangdong Administration in the field of press and publications, radio, film and television.
A preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group’s New Express newspaper published several false reports about Zoomlion’s stock exchange in the period from September 2012 to August 2013.
“The editorial board of the New Express has been disoriented,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said the decision had been made to “put an administrative charge on Chen Yongzhou in the form of a revocation of his reporter’s license.”
He also instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete correction of errors in the “New Express” and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the situation of the responsible persons of the newspaper and immediately make changes to the management of the “New Express”.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the “New Express” in which he claimed financial violations in the company’s operating construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the front line, stating that it supports his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television with the recognition that he had published fake articles for the money.
“In this case, I hurt Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust,” he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen's confessions, the New Express issued an apology in the first column, stating that the newspaper was unable to properly verify his reporting.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects have made confessions on television.
Experts say the practice of breaking up confessions in China is still widespread everywhere, despite recent amendments to laws that prohibit the authorities from forcing anyone to self-determination.
The U.S.-Mexico tunnel for drug trafficking, equipped with its own railroad, has been discovered
It is one of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems.
The U.S. authorities have described this four-foot-wide tunnel as one of the most difficult secret passages they have ever discovered.
This tunnel, whose zigzags are almost six football fields long, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
This area is filled with inconspicuous warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were inadvertently smuggled through it, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men, who, according to law enforcement officials, worked as drivers, were charged with storing marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of spreading.
In case of conviction, they are threatened with prison terms of 10 years until life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after harvesting marijuana crops in October, which posed a difficult task for drug cartels to quickly deliver their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage about 700 yards long, equipped with railroads, which went from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Pensions have been increasing in Belarus since November
Pensions have been increasing in Belarus since November of this year, according to the BELTA correspondent in the main pension management department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
From November 1, this year, the adjustment of the average salary of employees in the republic, applied in the previous pension recalculation, will be carried out with an increase of its amount by 5.4% and the corresponding recalculation of pensions will be carried out in accordance with the Decree of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic.
As a result of the recalculation from November, working pensions by age will increase, on average, by 5.3%.
The average pension by age will be Br2 million 295 thousand.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million inhabitants of the republic.
The costs of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus for the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November of this year will increase by Br274.3 billion in the calculation per month.
At the same time as the recalculation of labour pensions in November of this year, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and pensions will be recalculated in connection with the increase of the budget of the subsistence minimum, on average per capita.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million 47 thousand 530 - 2.1 per cent higher than it operated from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, 2.1% from November 1 will increase the size of minimum occupational pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and supplement to pensions.
In Belarus, more Br53 trillion was invested in the payment of pensions taking into account increases in 2013.-0-
British police are handing Assange a notice of extradition
British police today handed over a notice of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who hid in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had given a 40-year-old Australian "official demand to surrender" with a requirement to appear in a police station, adding that if he failed to comply, he would be further arrested.
Assange is threatened with extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he exhausted his ability under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the U.S., he hid in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "gave a 40-year-old man an official demand to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice," the press secretary said.
It continues to violate the terms of bail.
The embassy refused to comment on the police notification.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the U.S. to face possible charges of espionage following the publication of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic tapes at a counter-intelligence WikiLeaks website.
A driver who drove at a speed of 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1000
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1000 for driving at speeds of up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between the legs.
35-year-old Andrew Howey from Tiptre, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to carry him between his legs.
In the Colchester World Court, Howie admitted to driving the charge without due care and attention.
The addition to his driving licence of seven penalty points led to him receiving a six-month ban on driving.
Howie also pledged to pay costs of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and an additional fee to help victims of the crime of <0xC2><0xA3>100.
The tax on foreign real estate owners will lead to the fact that the London bubble is collapsing
The Treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the measure on the tax on the increase of capital, but expects a final decision from Mr. Osborn, who in the 2012 budget introduced a rate of state tax of 7% for houses worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million, and an annual fee for rents for purchases.
At present, the real estate tax in the areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, already exceeds the total amount in Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North-East and North-West, and North-West.
Mr. Cook said: “After the increase of the state tax on expensive houses and the introduction of related legislation against avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is depreciated regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this move could lead some foreign investors to unwillingly buy real estate in London or its current owners won’t want to sell it,” he added.
The cost of first-class real estate – the top 5-10% of the housing market at a price – in the rich south-west belt of London, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen to a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show a sustained growth of 5.6% per year, but they were overshadowed by an actively developing “homeland market” with a surge in prices in the south-west, north (7.4%), and west (7.4%).
Scientists have shed light on how the movements of the dog’s tail are related to her mood.
Earlier studies have shown that happy dogs roll their tail to the right side (from the dog’s point of view), while anxious dogs move their tail mainly to the left side.
But now scientists say that other representatives of the dog family may notice these subtle differences in tailings and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, says: “It is well known that people on the left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in the formation of constructors that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this and other species.
He added that just like in humans, dogs have the right side of the brain that controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To find out more about how dogs respond to the multiplexing of other dogs’ tails, the researchers looked at animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
We’ll probably soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way, and sometimes they go the other way.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed dogs videos with dogs — either naturalistic versions or silhouettes to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate tail movement and steer the tail more left or right.”
When the animals saw that the rest of the non-expressing dog was moving the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog’s tail protruding), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail leaned mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog’s tail protruding), their heart rate was happy and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn’t think the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience, what movements they should worry about, and what they should not.
He notes: “If there are multiple encounters with other dogs and often their tail being thrown into one side is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts based on this experience.”
The researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal’s emotions.
A dog behavior expert, John Bradshaw, an invited scientist at the University of Bristol’s veterinary school, said it was not the first study to check whether dogs are of significance to the left and right sides.
Last year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a happy dog.
And in another scientific paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail was tilted to the left rather than to the right rather than become anxious – the opposite behavior towards an Italian study.”
He said the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
“While there is enough evidence on different mammals that two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be registered, we will probably soon understand why their tails sometimes go to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed the concert in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This Sheffield group was due to perform at the city concert venue Hydro on Friday.

This statement was made after she was forced to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to transfer the show to the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after applying for medical assistance, Arctic Monkeys should also postpone the show on Hydro’s platform in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
“Alex Turner was diagnosed with laryngitis, and, unfortunately, he is unable to speak.”
The show at LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the show in Glasgow on Hydro will take place on November 21.

Pope Francis Names First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will inaugurate the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time during his service on February 22, as announced by the Vatican on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the cardinal’s age of 80, he can no longer take part in the election of the pope – this is the prerogative of the group of 120 “elective cardinals”.
In announcing this news, Vatican Press Secretary Federico Lombardi said that a meeting of all the current cardinals, known as the Consistory, will be held before the ceremony of the building in San Francisco.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors is likely to decrease.
He said the pope usually names as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of elective cardinals back to 120, as well as as as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
The consistory next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, according to Valero.
At the moment, there is some kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if a new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
In South America, 40 percent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a zero number of cardinals.
It will also be the first elected cardinals since the formation of the Franciscan Council of Cardinals – a group of eight cardinals from all over the world tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was "very possible" that Francis would appeal to the cardinals for advice.
But we haven’t been in this situation before — all for the first time.
Valero said the popes usually appointed Cardinal Bishops from large incomes, but Francis was “a pile of surprises – so we don’t know who he will call.”
GM recalls a number of new pickups in the U.S. to refine seat backs
General Motors Co. is recalling nearly 19,000 all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address manual seat-back tilt regulation issues, according to a notice from U.S. regulators in the field of road safety.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the mechanism of the tilt of the back.
As a result, the seat backs do not meet the federal safety standards for head restraints.
“When hitting a car behind the wheel, the header may not properly protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” the National Road Traffic Safety Administration said on its website.
Revocable models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
The release of GM pickups began in June and is the most important launch of the car in series production for the leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of pickups about the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was unable to review the notice to the owners in connection with the 16-day shutdown of the government, which reduced the increase in car sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, rose by about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM’s shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent on Friday to $37.47.
Obama's voice of desperation
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope for the possibility of change.
He says Obama has allowed the obstructionism of Republicans to detract from commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot serve as a justification for problems with Obama’s reformed health care system’s website, drone attacks
The Obama campaign memoirs of 2008 are a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student of the second course of the Harvard University Medical School.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
I thought that this book would inspire me in a time of fatigue at the second course of the medical school and bring back a sense of hope in me.
It’s called “The Boldness to Win,” and it’s a memoir about Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing my patient reports in the evening and lie down in bed, this book brings me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people, and the speeches could have captured the spirit.
The victory in the election proved impressive, and leading news programs took a break to understand this historic moment.
My classmates were crying for joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists had to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
At the time of Obama's inauguration in 2008, his level of support was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
A return to the present is a rude awakening, like a withdrawal from a dream.
It’s hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem like a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years that have passed since I dropped my first ballot, the changes have really happened.
It was something I couldn’t even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the repeal of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Say” rule, the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to advance our country forward: immigration reform, the possibility of choosing public health and the closure of the Guantanamo base among others.
But after countless times when I was on the side of the Obama administration, protecting it from colleagues and peers, I ended up with explanations that I could provide.
I have reached the point of political desperation.
The obstructionism of the republicans cannot explain the permission to interrogate foreign leaders or to strike by drones on innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the private lives of Americans by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of whistleblowers revealing the government's unlawful actions.
He cannot explain the murder of an American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial and prosecution or failure to comply with state funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the report’s findings, which state that the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And recently he can’t justify the failure to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Was it my duty at the age of 18 to understand that leadership could be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it?
It is obvious that the work in the electoral post is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by the opposition political party and random events such as the massacre in Newtown.
However, from all the examples I have listed above, it is evident that they were largely the administration’s own choice.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and crude alternative, he seemed unable to make a decision on his own policies or views.
I believed that in his second term, Obama, freeing himself from the pressure of future elections, justifies the hopes we have heard of for such a long time.
However, when Obama’s rating dropped below 45 percent this week, it became much harder to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me push through the many promises that have come to pass.
This week I read that part of the book that describes how Clinton caused Obama a deafening defeat in the primary election in Pennsylvania.
At the failure analysis meeting, he told his employees that they should return to normal and remain true to their goal.
“I want us to get our attraction back,” he said.
“We have to remember who we are.”
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of childcare leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of childcare leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining industry magnet, which has an unsolved carbon tax dispute of $6 million, made this statement at a time when he was trying to get away from the question of whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in deciding on the abolition of carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that the conflict of interest could only be with ministers, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from political measures.
“He has a big conflict of interest when it comes to a paid childcare leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they get a leave or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially announced Mr. Palmer as the winner in the fight for a seat from the Sanchain-Cost constituency of Fairfax, with 53 votes in favour after the recount.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the electoral counting procedure to speed up the process.
Daughters of Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should a decision on these elections be made two months after we have voted?
“We need to have a more perfect system,” he said.
Why shouldn’t we have such a system so that we can come in, enter our data into the computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 p.m. the same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for markings in bulletins.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn’t like it?
Using pencils in our time seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is studying the possibilities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his program included an international airport for San Francisco and he would be “very serious” about his new job.
The state office presupposes service to society.
“We don’t seek any awards except for the gratitude of history, for the fact that at a critical moment we can serve this district,” he said.
RBS Removes Two Currency Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily removed the work of two traders in its currency operations unit, according to information from two people familiar with the situation, which is yet another confirmation that the global verification by regulators of alleged currency manipulations is on the market.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world’s largest financial market, whose daily turnover is $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees to be removed during an ongoing investigation, which is rife with a scandal related to manipulations with the LIBOR interbank rate.
Refusing to comment on the withdrawals, the bank confirmed that this month it received requests for information from regulators.
“Our ongoing investigation of this issue is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, whistleblowers said RBS had sent e-mails and instant messages that it had received and sent to the former UK regulator, the Financial Activity Control Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Ascher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as he knows, was granted a leave of absence to his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was removed from work by Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any of the violations.
Mr. Asher's instant messaging contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to the informed.
The UBS bank said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators in the world — the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland’s antitrust body Weko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers have entered into a currency-related agreement.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, familiar with the person’s situation.
Banks are looking at instant messages and e-mails for several years in search of cases of violations.
The news of the checks has overshadowed traders in the field of activity, which in recent years has been one of the largest sources of income of trading units of investment banks, which this year, however, has faced difficulties due to the fact that the low volatility of the repurchased currencies is decreasing favorably.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation by saying that an extensive and high-liquid currency market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say it is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading on the foreign exchange market, the fragmentation of liquidity between various trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their internal platforms means that “you can start to influence the market for quite a bit”.
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of its London Stock Exchange’s stock traders this week after it caused losses of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue was able to localize,” Credit Suisse said.
U.S. Supreme Court Supports Obama’s Health Law
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that Barack Obama’s landmark health care law is constitutional, which is a major victory for the Obama administration.
By voting 5 to 4, the judges ruled that individual provisions under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which require citizens to purchase health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine, are constitutional in accordance with the government’s powers of taxation.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2,700-page law and further ruled that the requirement of the Health Care Act to increase states’ compliance with Medicaid program requirements, otherwise they will lose all federal funding for the Medicaid program, is not unconstitutional.
The request for blocking the bill was made by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the major Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate, Mitt Romney.
Is football a different reason?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the "Open Tribune", politicians and experts talked about how to preserve the national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was this: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because of this game - there are scandals and differences.
Speaker Sergey Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that in order to reduce the “degree of tension in society” politics and the media should be correct in the statements.
Probably, he meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the telecasts threatened to surround the Caucasus with looped wires, if there they do not want to limit the birth rate...
All spoke about measures to regulate migration from CIS countries, and about measures to harmonise relations between the peoples of Russia, which gave the discussion a chance.
Maksim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulev are "a model conflict that could have been predicted", but "for these questions we have too many people and instances to answer", and seven grandchildren have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which has long been practiced by Europe towards migrants, has, in the opinion of the public, failed and must find its way.
Historian Yuri Petrov has placed great hopes on a new single textbook of history.
“It is still necessary to create a contribution to the history of the culture of the peoples of the country so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what people live in Dagestan, and vice versa,” he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed to impose criminal liability for "calls to dismember Russia": "If in the US to say on the radio that you have to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard “not to burn”.
As usual, he accused journalists of bringing sick and acute national problems to public discussion: “There is little to say in the dust of the controversy!”
The leader of the faction "United Russia" Vladimir Vasilyev immediately advised journalists to conclude a "paper" and to agree to hold talks on this topic carefully, and then the same obligations can be assumed by politicians.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order in general is established, said Mr. Vasilyev.
As an example, he introduced a law that places responsibility on regional and municipal authorities for the international peace on their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichenko did not share the excitement about this law: it does not have “clear ideas about what is the adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms and boundaries.
Therefore, the subjects will be treated in a different amount of these powers.
In addition, the municipalities do not have the personnel necessary to solve such complex issues, there are no means, and the methodological recommendations, which they could use, the center does not give them...
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities, Gadjimet Safaraliyev, proposed the establishment of a special agency with the terrible title of “Ministry of National Security”, which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s headed a similar ministry, later abolished, opposed it.
It is enough to have at the federal level a special person, a "minister without a portfolio", to whom you could turn, if anything.
“We are going to the edge, the shells are moving around, it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to speak out against provocations together, and this work should receive worthy information support,” said Vsevolod Chaplin, a representative of the RPC for relations with society.
There is no neutrality of the state with regard to dangerous ideologies, religious ones, including, in his opinion, should not.
Here, Oleg Nilov took the discussion to an unexpected thread: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, still need to be searched, but they are pushed not on that road, not on that road," - he said.
"No and the road" is the development of football: "It's the footballers who beat the whole crowd, the flags burn, the comrades who throw stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football?
There is another type of sport - rugby is called...
"There will be no equals in the world in this form of sport!" said the right-hand man.
No one will play rugby in the Caucasus! - immediately Mr. Zhirinovsky intervened.
You'll offer them another curling!
It is necessary to know the national features, it is still that the Georgian "Zaporozets" offer"...
In Yaroslavl, wild behavior on the stands was distinguished by the representatives of the Moscow club - during the game with the local club.
Football will be banned all over the country.
The head of the control and disciplinary committee of the Russian Federation Arthur Grigoryants reported that "Kuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles, transferred from the House of football correspondent "CE" Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Red Cross club were applied for the burning of the Dagestan flag by supporters on the podium during the 14th round home game against Anja.
At the meeting were representatives of both clubs, a person from the RFPL.
We looked at all the available materials.
For the wrongful behavior of the audience "Kuban" is punished for 500 thousand rubles.
Google, Samsung, Huawei filed a patent lawsuit against Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent claims against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, whose price it beat at the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which purchased $4.5 billion in Nortel patents, filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help compare search keywords on the Internet with relevant advertising, the lawsuit says, which is the basis of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are manufacturing phones running on Google’s Android operating system, which fiercely competes with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google proposed an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased the proposed price several times, eventually offering a total of $4.4 billion.
Having lost the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in this transaction the determining factor was partly Motorola’s patent library.
“Despite an unsuccessful attempt to acquire patents that are the subject of a lawsuit at the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar demands increased compensation for damages from Google, as it claims that a patent infringement by Google is intentional, according to the lawsuit.
Egypt’s first freely elected president takes oath
Mohammed Morsi takes an oath, but his feast day is unlikely to mark the end of Egypt’s political struggle.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he took the oath, becoming the country’s first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took an oath before 18 judges in black robes in a court building on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said during a ceremony aired live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been banned for most of the 84 years of its existence.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police when Morsi arrived with a small cortet shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and, unlike the presidential pump of Mubarak’s time, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his autocolony along the usually lively road connecting the city center to the south.
Although Morsi was ridiculed as a non-charismatic "reserve wheel" by the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has risen sharply since his victory and Friday performance, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only against the Islamists, but also against all those who want to bring the 2011 mutiny to the end of the decade.
“Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red collar, told judges in a wood paneled room where he took the oath.
Later, Morsi went to Cairo University, where he had to deliver his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra, which performed the state anthem, during which he stood on the stand "silently".
Field Marshal Hussain Tantavi was present.
His arrival was met with the slogan "Army and the People - One Hand", which scandalized hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a pillar of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a pillar of Islamist student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday on Tahrir Square, where an uprising that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year was born, and promised to return the powers of the president whose office was deprived by a military council that took over everything.
But having agreed to take an official oath before the court, and not before the parliament, as it is accepted, he is doing the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi’s speech on Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Association of Machine Builders of the Tyumen Region was held on the basis of the Yalutorov Automobile Plant.
As part of the event, the presentation of a new line for the production of electric welding tubes made of steel was held.
According to Denis Gribanov, the commercial director of the enterprise, in 2011 with the emergence of a new owner, a marketing study was conducted on the study of the market of sale of steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electric pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment on it for their production.
This year, more than 7,000 tons of manufactured products have been shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Grybanov.
In October, a new condition was launched, which allows to increase the range.
The plant produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for carpet-making, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, as well as a large - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the production level of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will account for about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to a different type of activity, the number of employees at the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in the plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase of more than 50 employees.
The company is retraining personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from the already available ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new unit of longitudinal cutting steel to a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of products, as well as another condition, with the speed of production of the pipe to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the enterprise is going to master the production of pipes, which are used in the housing and communal economy.
The management of the enterprise is tasked with closing up to 70 per cent of the demand of the Tyumen region in this product.
Leonid Ostroumov, deputy director of the investment policy department, addressing the production managers, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This includes forms of state support for the industry, which include the reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.
This year it is planned to allocate 150 million rubles for these purposes, two-thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider the grant agreements, will accept documents from the enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs for the participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the next year, the budget provides funds of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million for energy saving programs.
Up to 72 million rubles of funds for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future this form of support will cease, as the reason for its introduction was the compensation of the tax on the extraction of useful fossil fuels, which oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they are not doing so, and subsidies are becoming the direct spending obligations of the region.
In view of this, the Government of the region considers direct support for industrial enterprises as a priority, rather than financing through them the oil industry.
The budget support will be related to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many managers of the enterprises expressed concern about the situation in relation to the oil tankers.
The subsidy for the equipment purchased by them is a competitive advantage of the industry of the south of the Tyumen region, and when it is cancelled it will be difficult to compete at a price with the average Russian belt, where cheaper labor force.
In addition, the question of the succession of the new owner of TNK-VR - the company "Rosneft", which has not yet placed its orders at the enterprises in Tyumen.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and applications for its extension have not been received.
Currently, enterprises in the south of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
The question remains whether taxes will be received from the oil produced in the Uvatsky region to the budget of the region or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
Tomic will work 240 hours for extremist film on social network
The Lenin District Court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of mandatory work of a resident of the city, who posted a video of extremist orientation on the social network, RIA Novosti reported on Friday a representative of the press service of the regional court.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page in a popular social network, which is included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was initiated against him under the article of the Russian Criminal Code “Actions aimed at the instigation of hatred and hostility, as well as the humiliation of human dignity committed publicly”.
“The Lenin District Court has examined the case in a special way and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime by imposing a sentence of 240 hours of mandatory work,” the agency’s spokeswoman said.
She added that the man fully acknowledged his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a price collapse after signing an association with the European Union
Prime Minister of Ukraine Nikolay Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will be significantly reduced after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a conversation with readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, among which there are, including, customs payments.
Thus, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area Regulation, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
This means that prices will also have to go down.
“This is about goods coming from EU countries,” Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the effect of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
However, there should also be no price increase.
Therefore, the messages on the billboards, which have recently appeared in our country quite a lot, that the association with the EU is an increase in prices, it is not quite so, or, to be more precise, it is not so,” – summed up Azarov.
Investigators are checking information about the abuse of a child in Biysk
On 29 October, the media published a report that the nurse of one of the kindergartens of the city of Biysk closed the child in the basement for educational purposes.
All the circumstances are currently being clarified by the investigators, as well as a legal assessment of the actions of the kindergarten staff.
After the accusation in the stupidity of Evgenia Vasilyev spoke
Yevgeny Vasilyev, to whom the attention of the media has been attached for almost a year, has not yet commented on numerous publications in the press about the abductions in the Ministry of Defense, and about her personally - relations with the ex-minister of defense Anatoly Serdyukov and Priety Vestyukov.
However, on November 1, the figure of the case "Obronservice" broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva said: “Initially, of course, the task was exactly one: to extract any negative information from me about the former Minister of Defense.”
There was blackmail for me to give testimony, otherwise I would be put in jail.
To this day, these threats have ceased.
Next we go to court, we'll prove our innocence.
We are 100 percent sure of victory.
At the same time, it can be concluded from the interview that perhaps most of Vasiliev’s words about what she doesn’t have with taste.
Probably, it is meant the statement of the official representative of the SC of the Russian Federation Vladimir Markin that in the collection of paintings, collected by the figure of the case "Oboronsservis", were found counterfeits.
Among the arrested property are a number of paintings that the owner, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the artistic expertise, appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings, found that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap counterfeits,” Markin said in early October.
Some of the pictures were stolen from the Department of Defense.
Then they admitted that they weren’t stolen from the Ministry of Defense, but they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I think it’s just an infinity,” Vassilyeva says.
Asked if she would admit her guilt in at least one of the 12 criminal episodes, Vasilyeva said: “Of course, no.
To admit nothing at all.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation, which we are talking about.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today’s statement of the Russian SC that Vasilyev is avoiding the study of criminal case materials, the lawyer of the figure said that he and his client “does not let the investigator get acquainted with the case materials”.
What has been the reason for the revelations that Vasilieva, who was under house arrest, has not yet communicated with the press?
How could a woman not have been able to not respond to the accusation of bad taste?
Or is it right for Komsomolka journalists, who claimed a few days ago that she “fell into an even bigger trance under house arrest” because of the news of the reconciliation of Anatoly Serdyukov with his wife and his return to the family?
The well-known military observer of the “KP” Viktor Baranets in his article “Serdyukov returned to his wife?” wrote: “The investigators do not rule out that after such a shock it can become more conversational on interrogations.”
Earlier, Vasiliev took on some charges of illegal sale of real estate of the Ministry of Defense.
Pre-winter trouble.

Do you think travel agents left in the past thanks to the Internet?
The company Flight Centre seems to be seeing a reverse trend.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and expects record earnings from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
This tourism firm now expects its main full-year pre-tax profit to range from $325 million to $340 million, compared to the previous forecast in the range of $305 million to $315 million.
If the current benchmarks are reached, this will be a 12-17 percent increase compared to a record profit of $290.4 million received in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Turner said Flight Centre received 8 percent of its first half-year profits and started the second half with good returns, especially on Sunday trips to Australia and the UK.
“For the period from the beginning of the year, we are working with profits in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to make a record high profit in the full year before interest and tax contributions are deducted,” he said.
“This includes Australia and the UK, which usually bring us the biggest profits.”
In Australia, leisure business in the second half of the year was restored, which compensated for a somewhat weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in the UK, the business of Flight Centre in the leisure sector went well, while corporate customers spent less.
Her business in the U.S. offset losses suffered during the seasonally weak first half, and is expected to make a profit for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre shares increased by 3 cents to a mark of $38.20.

In Yekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Yekaterinburg, the police are conducting a search for a criminal who has dealt harshly with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies burned.
As reported to the "New Region" in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlovsk region, on the eve of the day in the Kirovsk region of the Ural capital after the extinguishing of the fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on Uralska street, the bodies of two women confessed to us were found.
The identities of the dead were soon established.
It turned out that these are sisters, one of them is a resident of Yekaterinburg 44 years, the second - a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
They took off the burned apartment a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under the personal control of the chief police officer of the Mikhail Borodin region.
The internal affairs bodies produce different versions of the murder, verifying the alibi of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it is established for what purpose the women took the apartment, and where they lived before what they did, with whom they maintained a relationship.
Schools called for more attention to mathematics, orthography and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British art literature since 1914.
The exam will also feature “unprogrammed texts” to encourage more extensive reading.
The joint course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to pass a separate graduate exam in the language, with persistent recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is due to release new English and Mathematics curricula tomorrow – the first subjects subject to a radical revision.
It will make changes to other core subjects next year.
A separate regulatory body in the field of OFQUAL exams will present the revised structure of high school graduation exams, with a new assessment system and a smaller volume of coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gouw said that “a broad consensus has been reached that we must reform our exam system in order to restore public confidence,” insisting that school graduation exams will be “more complex, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, and in Singapore, students take about 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on maths scheduling, coalition sources said that large-scale school graduation exams in mathematics combined with an increased coefficient in the rankings table, will most likely serve as a stimulus for this school to pass.
In terms of education, more attention will be paid to “real-life tasks,” including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Heihe will cost tourists 2,200 rubles
From tomorrow from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe, tourists will start to ride ships on an air mattress.
For those who want to travel to China, this means additional expenses.
A ticket for a pumice is traditionally much more expensive than for a warm-up.
As reported in the reference service of the company "AmurASSO", the cost of the usual ticket will be 2 200 rubles.
The ride through the hall of increased comfort will cost 2,800 rubles.
By the way, this season tickets did not travel: at the same price the puma was driven by tourists and last spring, and a year ago - autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: the growth rate of GDP of the Russian Federation is not enough for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers the growth rate of its GDP insufficient for the Russian Federation and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the conditions of business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, reports Reuters.
This year we planned to increase GDP in the region by 3%, maybe even a little more.
It's actually going to be a little less than 2%.
Against the backdrop of the recession in general, a number of European countries would not seem to be very bad, but for us it is little, because the economic base is not as powerful as a number of countries in general, and in general, in order to develop, there must be higher rates.
Now it is very important that Russian companies, Russian business get normal loans at a normal price - this is the first thing that must be done," the head of government stressed.

A journey through mud, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. George Bwelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend taking in hundreds of patients
There are not so many doctors in this West African country – only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile device.
Dr. George Bwelle is one of CNN’s top 10 heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other top 10 heroes to make him a CNN Hero of the Year.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, George Bwelle saw his father come back to life and fall back into an unconscious state, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Bwelle was injured in a car crash in 1981 near Yaunde, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of himself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” George Bwelle said.
If we had the money, we would have taken it out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle said.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you are no longer the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some may die because of what they have to wait for.
The situation hasn’t changed much since Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could go to the doctor, many of them would not be in their pocket.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health care spending in it is private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
And because of poverty, they can’t enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. George Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
He became a doctor himself and worked as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 other people are loaded into the vans, tied to the roofs of medical supplies, and travel across a crossed area to visit those in need of village help.
They don't always have good luck.
Many times they had to push cars through rivers and dirt.
But when they arrive, they are met as real heroes: it is a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms that can only be offered by locals.
Free medical care in these villages is indeed a reason for the holiday, and Bwelle with his wide smile and limitless energy is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the brigade begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on each trip,” Bwelle said.
They come from the whole district within a radius of 60 kilometers of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics on the weekend provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment from malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get skeletons, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — documents needed for schooling that many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evening, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school building, a municipality or a home; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the post-operative zone to free up space for the next person.
Using a generator to light up the operational and sanitary treatment equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It’s a slow pace, but the brigade’s aim is usually to help support rural musicians.
“They’ve been beating drums all night so we can wake up and keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade go back to the city, tired, but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, has conducted 700 free surgeries over the past year, and they know that their help can be of great importance to those they help.
One person explained that the free surgery he received to treat the hernia will allow him to work again.
“It will change the future for me and my family,” the man said.
In addition to these clinical admissions on weekends and working at the hospital, surgeon Bwelle also works nights at private medical clinics around Yaunde.
It is this second work, he said, that provides 60% of the funding for his non-profit organization; the remaining funds are covered by private donations.
“I don’t even know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-grade medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer at the Bwell group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that these campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses such as O’Malley, who come from the US and Europe to join Bwelle in the realization of his tasks, this is an opportunity of practice that they would never have gotten at home.
“We were given the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or keep the tools for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley said.
As a secondary school student, you would never get such an opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon on their own, often arriving with donated medications.
But upon arrival in Yaoundé, their food, transportation, and training pay for Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, no doubt,” O’Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, an almost constant workload is not a hard test.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling this promise to their father is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” said Bwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see how you can help.
Snowden Agrees to Give Evidence of Merkel's Hearing
A member of the Bundestag, Hans Christian Strebel, met in Moscow with Edward Snowden.
During the conversation, the question was discussed whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the German Attorney General's Office in the case of a possible wiretapping of the German Chancellor's phone by the U.S. Special Forces.
Snowden said he was willing to give the necessary evidence.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
“He made it clear,” said Hans-Christian Strebele, “that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency, led by Kit Alexander, blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
First, however, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding U.S. spy programs.
Yesterday, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill introducing additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. Department of Electronic Intelligence.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in the development and deepening of relations in all spheres and areas.
This was announced to journalists by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus Vladimir Makey at a press conference following a meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu, the correspondent of BELTA reports.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in the development and deepening of Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the authorities of the state administration of the two countries will provide comprehensive assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts with each other," said Vladimir Makey.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The minister also reported that another 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission had been held in Ankara, which resulted in the signing of the protocol.
The parties have developed a road map of Belarusian-Turkish interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment areas, in the spheres of industrial cooperation, energy, transport
"The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners," he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, said that during the negotiations, the heads of the foreign policy agencies of the two countries decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
Trade between Belarus and Turkey, according to the minister, needs to increase and bring it to the figure of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the field of investment cooperation, which needs to be developed further, as there is unused potential in this area, he said.
There have always been very warm relations between our countries, and we hope that in the future they will further strengthen and expand.
And all the necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic ties and for the successful operation of Turkish companies in the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," Ahmet Davutoglu said.
Obama Refuses to Give Up on Health
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama yesterday went on to renegade about his often repeated, unambiguous promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people are being notified of the termination of services from their providers, Republicans in recent days have criticized the president for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama made a few tweaks to his original public promise.
“Most people who have health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called a “resurrection in the news” about the termination of services, Obama called on Americans to look for other options on the market.
Most people will be able to get better, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
“You will get more favorable conditions,” he said.
The administration said it should not surprise anyone that 5% of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve the best,” Sibelius said in a speech to the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online sales platform has been “horrifyingly bad” since October.
“I’m just as upset and upset as everyone else is,” she said.
I really want to restore your trust.”
Irritated Sibelius defied this phrase, which was caught by the included microphone, sitting behind her an assistant at yesterday's hearings in the chamber after heated debates with a member of the House of Representatives, Billy Long, a Republican from the state of Missouri, a health-dealing, tom-deal.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long again urged Sibelius to say why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
Rosbalt agency has lost media status for non-censored wave
On October 31, the Moscow Court decided to recognize an invalid license for the registration of the agency "Rosbalt", - writes "Lenta".
Roskomnadzor insisted on the deprivation of the status of the media agency - for systematic and gross violations of the law on the media.
An unpleasant precedent was established during the process: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact denying the publication the right to make counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
ZAO "Rosbalt Information Agency" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information-analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was on the list of the most recognizable private online media in Russia.
At the same time, "Rosbalt" has always occupied a fairly specific niche: the core of exclusive publications of the agency were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the closeness of the publication to the force structures continued throughout the agency ' s existence.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive database of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions, it was also said that Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Viktor Cherkesov, was the head of the project.
At the same time, the role of Chaplin in the management of "Rosbalt" is not clear until the end: most often it is called "the project manager".
The general director of the agency is Larisa Afonina, the editor-in-chief is Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt did not appear in the ratings of the federal media - either in terms of citation or in terms of the audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the ranking of the visit of Russian media sites according to the version of LiveInternet.
According to LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), the monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months - notes on the Kremlin's helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group "King and a joke", the defeats in the capital Biryulev.
The Rosbalta conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when an amendment to the Media Act came into force, banning journalists from non-censorship.
The agency found a forbidden lexicon in two videos published on the agency’s website (“The Giant from Krasnodar” and “Pussy Riot desecrated the oil spikes”).
The other parts are described in different ways.
Roskomnadzor accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violation of the law on the media on the basis of the video materials found and appealed to the court with a demand to obtain a license from the agency.
In "Rosbalt" stated that the claims of the department are illegal: first, the videos were not editorial materials, second, the mother words in them were masked, and, third, immediately after the warning of the video were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed Roskomnadzor’s claims in the world court – and when on October 22, 2013, the Moscow court accepted Roskomnadzor’s lawsuit, the consideration of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, already 25 world judges have made a decision not in favor of Rosbalt: the editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violation of the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each roll.
Obviously, this prevented the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow Court – if you give up the idea that the outcome could have been prevented even earlier.
On 31 October, the court decided to recognize the invalid certificate of registration of "Rosbalt", effectively depriving the agency of the status of the media.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone in the course of this confrontation.
The agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (application to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov signed 26 deputies on October 10; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the CPRF).
The illegality of the closure of the publication was stated by the head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the president of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the Presidential Human Rights Council Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the management of Roskomnadzor even gave him some guarantees that until the revocation of the license the case will not come.
The court over "Rosbalt" showed: under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be a media outlet in Russia today - a big question.
Syria Has Destroyed Chemical Weapons Equipment <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Syria has destroyed all claimed chemical weapons production facilities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has acknowledged.
This first phase of disarmament was completed by Damascus a day before the deadline.
Until November 1, Syria had to destroy production facilities and other auxiliary facilities designed to prepare combatants for use, the BBC reported.
The destruction of the toxic substances themselves or their chemical components must be completed by the middle of 2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, the toxic substances are currently in sealed storage.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people died on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21 during a chemical attack, according to the US.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time – to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons – and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition equipment.
These production capacities will now be carefully monitored so as not to allow them to be repaired.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan to destroy the already existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There are a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence agencies.
They will be willing to advise inspectors on new facilities for inspection if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not fully open.
The United States believes that the shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is a matter of the hands of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership – in accordance with the agreement reached with the mediation of Russia – destroy or bring into a state of non-work all the power to produce shells, poison gases and liquids and to fill the shells of this thing.
Now that this stage has passed, the next step should be the destruction of the already existing Syrian army of chemical weapons.
It is assumed that this arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve-paralytic toxic substances, skin-inhaled mustard gas and other banned chemicals, stored in several dozen different locations.
For its destruction, it is necessary for the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to agree on a timetable of action to begin with – this is for two weeks.
OPCW Field Operations Director Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors had “personally observed the destruction of the equipment.”
“They no longer have the ability to conduct further production or mixing of chemical weapons,” he said.
The OPCW said in a statement that inspectors visited 21 of the 23 facilities in Syria and made sure that the production facilities of shells and poisons were either destroyed or put into harm’s way.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, the document says, but the equipment from there was transported and checked by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was "particularly difficult", as work had to be done in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, however, according to Smith, time to celebrate it with inspectors has not yet been found - they were too busy at work.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented confession that U.S. spying “has gone unscathed far”
John Kerry has shown a softening of the tactics of protecting U.S. surveillance programs, making an unprecedented admission that in some cases U.S. spying “has gone unwelcomely far.”
The secretary of state also acknowledged that he was to blame, along with Barack Obama, for being “on the autopilot” during the appearance of Edward Snowden’s loud revelations about the NSA’s spying activities.
These leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video communication at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the government, have actually taken up some of the things that are happening on the autopilot, because there are already very, very many opportunities in the work of the Second World War.
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. spying went too far, but stressed that no one’s rights were violated.
He said: “In some cases, this has gone a long way.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain it to people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis so that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there are no abuses against innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted out of goodwill and that his follow-up operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow people up and attack governments.
And if you were able to catch it, stop it before it happens?
“We actually prevented plane crashes, explosions in buildings and killing people because we were able to find out about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. spying abroad and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint anti-terrorist activities with the U.S., the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of disappointment over the surveillance carried out by the National Security Agency.
“For the sake of U.S. national security it is really important that Europeans remain our supporters in relation to our common anti-terrorist efforts,” said Democrat Murphy, who serves as the first term chairman of the Senate International Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, in your interview.
“And I’m going to Europe to let them understand that we must continue to cooperate in the field of counter-terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs.”
News that the NSA has collected millions of records of phone calls in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the agency’s head said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that the U.S. allies had gathered with NATO and who they were.
Other disclosures included documents published by Snowden that show that the NSA was monitoring Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone, as well as the phones of about 34 other world leaders.
James Clapper, director of national intelligence, defended spying on allies as necessary and said it was a normal affair on both sides.
Against the background of this noise, Murphy said that his office is organizing a trip of members of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hopes that members of both parties and chambers will join the delegation.
The names of other participating legislators should be voted on in the coming days.
According to him, the travel program is still in the development stage.
Although Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to help improve relations, he said some degree of “hardness from the best motivations” would also be revealed.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people about what spy programs they have used for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence activities,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry will have to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address the issues of hostility to the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence activities.
The influence of prisoners will increase in the new composition of the public supervisory commissions
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve the new composition of the Public Oversight Commissions (ONCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, the lobbyists of the powerhouses will increase their influence.
The ONC is a public body that controls the conditions of detention in places of deprivation of liberty.
The works of Sergey Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozhaev, the riots in the Kopean colony - it is through the ONC that most of the resonant incidents are reported behind bars.
There is a struggle between human rights defenders and lobbyists of the armed forces for control of the UN.
At the meeting of the OPC Working Group on the Formation of the OPC, I proposed to make the selection of experience in human rights activities a criterion.
“It was not accepted, and lists were formed without developing criteria,” says Valery Borshchev.
Borshchev, the current chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, is an all-Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison issues.
In his capacity as deputy of the State Duma from "Applok" he developed a law regulating the activities of the ONC.
The OP Council should vote for the composition of the ONC in 43 regions of the country.
There are fewer than 1,000 candidates for 1,800 vacancies, and competitions in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria were unable to organize due to the lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize a selection in vacant places.
ONK Moscow is one of the few commissions with a contest, despite the fact that in the new composition there will be 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borshchev, in the current composition of the capital commission, 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and in the variant, which is on the ballot in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to enter the capital commission.
However, the representative of the “Battle Brotherhood” Vyacheslav Kalinin may re-enter the new composition.
He was a member of the ONC for three years, but never visited the prisoners.
Borshchev believes that, by appointing his chairman of the ONC, the security forces will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not rule out a collective exit from the commission.
According to them, the promotion of the militants is coordinated by member Anton Tsvetkov, the head of the "Officers of Russia" - an organization that defends the interests of the power agencies.
“I don’t eat babies on the track,” Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies lobbying for the promotion of any lists and says he is not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested opposition members.
According to Tsvetkov, he didn’t even care what list they are voting for now in the OP.
The publication of Borshchev’s information considers it a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Chelyabinsk ONC.
Her former leaders will be removed due to last year's Kopean unrest.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of the prisoners.
Now, the Rostov-on-Don National Security Agency can move from human rights defenders to the security forces.
A human rights defender-president of the local commission “lost” from the new lists, but turned out to be one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public House ruled him out for unethical behavior.
Lists of Moscow and Rostov commissions Borshchev considers "a place for Kopeisk".
The disclosures of Hope Tolokonnikova did not affect the UN Mordovia, which is considered "forced": only one human rights defender wanted to enter the new composition, and she did not even accept documents for the competition.
OP member Nikolai Svanidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he is upset by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to other members of the council.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev says he voted for it because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
He coordinated the compilation of the lists of OPC Deputy Secretary Vladislav Grib, also an employee of the FSIN Research Institute.
Grib told the RBC daily that he does not believe it is right to divide candidates into human rights defenders and enforcers and does not agree that the chairpersons of the committees have enough powers to hinder the work of its members.
The Grib is not required to predict the outcome of the vote of the OP Council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended option will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian Woman Appeals Against Thailand’s Prison Term <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for falsely claiming that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, filed an appeal for conviction and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by the Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 after Thai police reported that the local taxi driver had carried out the attack on Sunday night, while two other men held her.
However, according to the video surveillance camera footage, it was later found that she had returned to her hotel after a breakup with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she admitted to fabricating the story.
Before the court, it was held in local police chambers.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in the detention centre of the general regime on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women’s prison for adults.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
“Obviously, it was an alarming time, but we hope she will return home safely as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bamford filed an appeal for her sentence and was released on bail at 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently on vacation in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand have reported that Bamford is currently a local lawyer in Phuket, but have warned that the appeal could lead to the court increasing her sentence to two years and forcing her to serve a term in prison for rape.
However, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michel Smith in Phuket, Thailand, he may also seek to restore his shattered tourist image, which will lead to a justifiable sentence.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Eltysheva", translated into French.
Recall, it was his novel that became the finalist of four awards: "The Clear Plain", "Russian Booker", "The National Bestseller" and "The Big Book".
And last year the writer for this book was awarded the prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is an undisputed leader in the generation of the current thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prosaic.
Virtually every publication of his hard work, built on the modern life material of stories and stories, causes heated controversy among critics in a wide variety of directions.
It can be argued that the combined articles on prose and journalism of Senchin, reviews of his books and journal publications create an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In the discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial modern writers", according to the critic Sergey Chuprinin, it is mostly about what its participants understand by the word "literature" as the present and future not only of our vocabulary, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow it to include most articles and reviews from regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are usually given in the abbreviation in the sections "Paragraphs..."
