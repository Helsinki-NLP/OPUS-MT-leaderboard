Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, they come to 29 percent in total
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous major coalition and a marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led to the first preliminary results of the pre-scheduled parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People’s Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP) suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of the previous chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the cusp.
In contrast, the election leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the K<0xC3><0xA4>rntner Landeshauptmann J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the <0xC3><0x96>VP cut off, losing almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially in the People's Party, which had demanded the previous elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP had left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
But the voters have probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case as early as Monday at an extraordinary session of the party leadership.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely way out of the electoral fold, i.e. to renew the large coalition of SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberties Union (FP<0xC3><0x96>) provisionally received 18 percent, the BZ<0xC3><0x96> eleven percent of the votes - but at the same time, the Social Democrats expressed their fear that 1999 could repeat itself, as the People's Party had agreed with the populists in 2005, when the referendum was held on the basis of the referendum.
J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to work with each party and is going from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal politics, is obviously relying on this development.
In addition, the Green Party also moved into parliament, which suffered slight losses and fell from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party is likely to have mastered the four-percent hurdle and therefore did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If it fails to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who were charged in India for the illegal collection of beetles, in the opinion of the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there could be some cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
“If this is not clear, then for sure, there will be some cooling off,” he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, in court cases, the executives could only take hard action.
Despite all this, he argued that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted by the prosecution and received a fine, the central government wants with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the case falls.
“His problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who has been sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi believes it would be best if he were to appeal to a higher court.
He could thus request bail for release and wait in freedom for his verdict, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also expressed himself during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon will be sought for him," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to encourage the condemned "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said, such assistance will already be offered to them by the Indian side.
“We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians admit that too,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he confirmed the Czech press agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK, in front of his partner, the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to arrest and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
One answer to the question of whether he has received the Indian side's commitment to deal with the matter, the Minister went away.
“I’ve been promised a lot,” he said.
A Czech man rules over the ring around the sea floor
It appears on an electronic map, on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are depicted.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and, together with it, the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-member staff of the UN Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His boss, the division director, the Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it on and on.
This is where work zeal and enthusiasm prevail.
The seabed has so far harbored a little-known world rich in natural resources.
Here you can find petroleum, other non-renewable ore and other raw materials, but also hitherto unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
Today, the countries of the Inland Seas enthusiastically announced their claim to the new sea areas.
According to a UN convention, they make use of their rights, which they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometers far from the shore of a country to the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
Simplifiedly, as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered to be a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It transcends the borders of the coastal sea, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by the relevant Commission country for establishing the outer borders of the continental shelf must be evidenced by extensive scientific and technical documentation, which is based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated over five applications, namely from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have had success,” Mikulka adds.
An international echo recently hit Australia’s success, which was the first country to significantly expand its maritime areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the sea floor granted to the country by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit that will flow to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also step by step submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment you ratify the "Agreement of Montego Bay".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is referred to by the convention as "the common heritage of humanity".
There is no longer a special position in this state.
The right to promote in this field shall be granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the sea floor is not a gold miner's land," says director Mikulka with some exaggeration, adding that "individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czechs in the Pacific
Today, part of the sea floor belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
It received the status of a so-called "road breaking investor" in 1991 on the basis of the Convention, as well as the investors of a few other states.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the sea floor.
"You can promote there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretions that contain nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division Rober Sandev brings such a pattern.
It reminds me of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the fabulous scheme that the legend has brought to life after the golem.
German special forces were on-site at the time of the hostage release
The Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
The circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are becoming increasingly known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Accordingly, both specialists of the Bundeswehr as well as officers of GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Force, the Federal Crime Office and logistics experts of the Technical Aidswerk were at the site of the liberation.
However, German forces were not needed because the hostage-takers let their prisoners run and flee when they had detected signs of a violent release, according to a ministry spokesman on Monday evening.
The Egyptian government has adopted the aid offered by Germany to integrate them as support forces on the ground.
“Fortunately, this has not happened,” a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers had kidnapped the group of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions in southern Egypt on September 19.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been smuggled back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The survivors have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages were in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, there was initially no information on when they would return to Germany.
According to the Bild newspaper, the five vacationers and the special forces will fly out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects bailout
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has barely failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went deep.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority for the program to contain the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic move, the proponents had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called the MPs for approval, even if the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent or by 600 points.
The investors were worried that the state bailout might fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, then, after becoming aware of the failure, to collapse again.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary for the programme to enter into force.
Organizers list increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
With travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study – even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic outlooks, according to a study, the desire of the Germans to travel remains unshakeable.
When bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a revenue increase of 31 percent compared to the previous year’s period, as reported by the Deutsche Reiseverband (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the investigation of the market research institute GfK, there are also already increased booking numbers for the autumn months.
For example, the increase in turnover of travel agencies for October was around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
These results are based on GfK figures, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and calculates high for the overall market.
The travel bookings made by the end of August 2008 are recorded.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travel to the United States in particular was requested, the DRV shared.
Here, the booking increase is about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local fields, were particularly sought after destinations for the Germans.
In particular, package trips are high in the course, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising costs of energy and food, the costs here are "more calculable for customers than during individually organized holidays".
Money could be saved by consumers, among other things, through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very well booked, so there will be a sales increase again compared to the previous year – although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from Liter-Kr<0xC3><0xBC>gen and promis in Designer-Dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t really have much in common.
She is a blonde, television presenter and wears a custom-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: Almost three minutes on the meadow, the photographers are already falling on us and cutting the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first visit to the meadow.
This is how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
Located in Wiesn-Touri and actually to the north of the White Wormsquator, the feeling of well-being in the trach to date was still limited.
But once you get to the Theresienwiese, everything is half so bad.
Almost everyone wears a dirndl or leather pants; no one looks up or awkwardly touches - everything is perfectly normal.
Strange views of the chocolate bar stand only harvest my dirndl shorts.
A M<0xC3><0xBC>nchnerin makes me aware that I had mistakenly tied the apron: "Lefts hoast free, middle virgin, forgive, right, chained to the back."
Secretly, I fry the loop from the back to the left.
"Good," he said, laughing.
Others make less effort for subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats, on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretch the naked back against an uninvited one.
The young man with the exhibitionist Attitudes named Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-drawn "oooooo".
He tells me this after he has emptied himself of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, everyone thinks he's a garbage can.
So Bob's one of those infamous "wild bees."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
By eight o’clock in the evening, health workers are walking in ravines over the main square, which must take care of the poor sugarcane.
The nurses always appear in the bowl - every four at a time tow a covered carry from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: Empty, full back.
You can't see who's under the plane in the Promille Sarg.
“These are the ones that goarnimmer pack,” one of the sanitizers called me on request and disappeared in the dungeon.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Sheffield Road in the city centre.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving after the accident.
In the meantime, he was released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deep into Turkey’s hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps inside Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial quest.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the travel guides tell you.
The building sits at the end of the railway tracks with a tower at each corner of the front and thus looks like any provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is about to collapse.
But once you’re inside the vaulted ticket switch, there’s no doubt about the superiority of the project, whose western approach was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolian Baghdad Society.
Germany, which was a late train driver in the imperialist game, had before its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond, what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperialist plans collapsed during the First World War.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the insurmountable limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces withdrew from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, largely transitioning from history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and all the east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of the T<0xC3><0xBC>kei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a brand new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the neighboring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of approximation.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splinter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the core data of this new foreign policy, I climbed the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a harrowing ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which as a new city, for the new secular state project, will look back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has triggered a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has taken me to the AKP’s main office, a specially crafted, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men’s and women’s, meet to meet.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even wrapped a blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exceptional phenomenon,” he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There would be no one or the other.
You should do both.
"But surely Turkey could at some point," I asked, "have to be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to make this decision."
He then pointed out a point that almost everyone I spoke to here almost routinely said: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as advantageous to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, so the message seems to be, can, in the transferred sense, run Europe as a whole on flat rails east towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha’s station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had witnessed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, lie in the hands of Turkey.
And as I waited at the dock for the ferry to take me back over the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At that time, at least, there seemed to be little doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley (recalled 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chorus.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus the following year.
It was intended for young people up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already in our late 20s – we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological change of form) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to take on any piece of music submitted to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and existed only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never read over years.
How often did death stop us from “talking the music to ourselves.”
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His manner of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never arrogant but never overwhelmable.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher one.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years or so, I’ve written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say I’ve never been disappointed by a single one – often I’ve been inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He abhorred conductors who, according to his words, simply “went home with one or two known sheep horses in the world.”
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his posthumous address to William Woodruff (September 25) you write that "he resumed teaching business history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman Research Scholarship in 1950... while at the same time studying for a BSc, an MA and a PhD.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", however, it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published as "The British rubber industry" in 1958.
He spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York in the United States in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to hide this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
<0x60>I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino <0x60>Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me pay attention to them because of their simplicity and because of the power they radiate, as they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.

Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this large-space limousine offers an even larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical subtleties that allow even more convenient driving and saving gasoline.
Changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made with this grand limo are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics will be emphasized.
However, before you start analyzing the new model, it must be said that this new jazz will appear six years later, after the first generation had appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time.
Although the Honda Jazz in Europe is less well known, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also in the course of 2008.
After the release of jazz on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second sales market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimate is 10,000 cars, which is 17% of the assumed growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the heads of the branches in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
Considered more accurately, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to hide the sales drop in Spain.
In reality, the brand’s leaders hope to complete the year with a total sales of 22,000 models, which is 4,000 fewer cars than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this, Honda is focusing on the appearance of a new model.
This is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to market estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the rest is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of the insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous model of jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading area, reaches up to 339 liters, i.e. 19 liters greater than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4-liter petrol engine, because the capacity of the Honda Jazz trunk space with a 1.2-liter petrol engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, in addition to the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves the output of 90 PS at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 min?1.
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it is now able to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
<0x60>Auto-Bene', which avoids collisions
To advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, this time Nissan was inspired by nature, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarming behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers at the Nissan Motor Co. Technical Development Center have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight compartment, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the facet eyes of the bees, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows them to fly undisturbed in their personal airspace without interruption.
To reflect the overall perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is directly translated into a signal to avoid collision.
At the moment when an obstacle is noticed, the small robot will mimic the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at 90<0xC2><0xB0> or even greater angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this escape maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If not, the robot might not be able to respond at sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate upwards or downwards, nor can it overwhelm; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way that the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
<0x60>This device only needs every few seconds to process the information and act according to that information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers performed, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of the technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan will introduce to the series cars over the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to lead to the destination while driving and avoiding obstacles along the way.

It should be noted that the U.S. Treasury Department, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis, and to prevent U.S. citizens from getting involved in mortgage histories of supposedly payable banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for Internet surfers: <0x60>Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe the ‘hotel of bad credit’ or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two, and up to three times whether it is the time to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably also the goal of the game.
It certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a side for teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it’s not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes its capital available for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and take over 21% of its capital, a renewal that is due to a strong drop in its exchange rate.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks stated that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley stock at a uniform price of $25.25, resulting in a total amount of three billion dollars.
The accepted price is below 19% of the share price as of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a 10% profit for it and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be carried out on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, i.e. 28% above the current price value.
However, Morgan Stanley’s stock fell 6.79% to $23.07 at 17.00 GMT.
“This strategic connection represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the status of a holding bank,” said John Mack, CEO of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley accepted this status last week, which will allow him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the deal has changed over the past few days: last Monday Morgan had simply stated that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
“A week ago,” Tokyo’s Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG’s managing director, said in a statement, “we thought the participation would consist entirely of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and protect ourselves.”
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below their exchange rate for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go off by about 20% per share with a reduction in profit.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares in one year if the latter is exchanged for more than 50% of the sale value within a given period, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a spokesman for the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After investing in MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment capacity rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan said he had “clearly” lowered his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group that had to watch their stock market price go down by half, while the price of anti-insurance payments accelerated to a high level.
This price declined on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivors” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had raised $15 billion, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The republic was founded around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
That third party was the one who, following the example of his peers and friends, put the plan of a new constitution to the vote.
Mission fulfilled, because according to the public results based on 80% of the voters’ votes, 64% voted ‘Yes’ in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted ‘No’, 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were left empty.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, more than half of all votes cast must be cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations’ exits and a countdown to a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for ‘Yes’, with 63% to 70% predicted.
By the way, on the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The ‘Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way’, he had insured in Guayaquil, the seat of government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observing order, referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure the "new socialism" for which the president is campaigning.
The draft constitution transfers state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to <0x60>development planning' in a country, which largely lives on the promotion of oil by foreign companies and by the foreign currencies that send the emigrants to the country.
The project, which will be promoted by the Correa elected in 2006, also grants the Head of State more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The constitution also secures the principle of free medical care and education, which the president has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also plans to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital in a healthy and unharmed manner this Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were liberated by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the al-Maza military base directly next to Cairo International Airport on board a special aircraft around 3.30 a.m.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, aboard a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign quarter of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoy all the ‘best health’ and the kidnappers ‘no ransom was paid’, Egypt’s tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said on the roll.
After being captured on September 19 at a caravan safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought closer by 35 unknown kidnappers from a hideout.
These are eleven tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
“On both sides, shots were fired and half of the hijackers were killed, the rest fled,” said the official, who wants to remain anonymous.
He stated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is currently located, about the role played by the secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
“We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence and special units,” he explained without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
The previous evening, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle during a patrol in which the hijackers were found, of which six, including the leader from Chad, were killed and two arrests.
The army stated that in connection with a rebel group from Darfur, they were connected to the movement Libération du Sudan-Unité (SLA-U), which, however, immediately contradicted this movement.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate about the financing of culture makes headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But a part of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and appeal to the pitiful sums granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or national historical sites, which are sadly starving?
Which politicians will dare to remind the federal government that they are neglecting their monuments and their culturally important buildings?
That there are no proper laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides 3.5 million euros alone for the restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all MPs and all government districts, and in a mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the Association of Historic Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers, gathered in 211 historic societies, are striving to deal intensively with history, with a few grosches to save the numerous private archives, and the archaeological remains preserved.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of desperation when supporters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments state-owned parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux states want to take control of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been hit by the US financial crisis in turbulence: the three states will put the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary, at a total cost of EUR 11.2 million.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Competition Authority officer.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been ongoing for a year, so decisions now made in connection with the bank could have a precedent.
In terms of the decision taken on Sunday, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank is likely to sell some of its holdings, primarily the insurance activities purchased by Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Shares of the Fortis started a steep downturn last week, in the second half of the week serious crisis scenarios were already emerging.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is far too large for a dispute.
The Institute’s securities fell 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
In view of the current stock prices, the market value of the group amounts to EUR 14 billion, which, according to the management, is unrealistic.
According to management, the $700 billion U.S. bailout is expensive and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is due to the downturn in Fortis stocks.
On Monday, however, the rates have risen slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank’s new CEO.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but no interested person with a factual offer was found.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to calm down – no investor should be shirking for his money, it said.
So far, there has been no panic among customers, the bank’s branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, the Fortis has its own branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fuchs in the chicken stables
Because of a person’s drug use, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of drug data in any case to the consent of the data subject.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the chicken to the fox," said Richard Dick, the developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurances determine the fees as well as the payout amounts in the event of damage depending on the health of the customer, and should the risk be overestimated, the insurance will not be completed at first.
In the past, the customer was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: based on the customer’s identification number, he retrieves the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, i.e., which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from what disease the customer suffers and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat level is untreatable, which would automatically put him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so the insurances only need to do more of the paperwork, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the drawbacks is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as against migraines and heatwaves, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurer’s point of view, while the ones mentioned above are not.
For the retrieval and processing of the data have formed their own companies, which, before they obtain the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they must do so by law, although no concessions have been made so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and combine them with the data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the patient’s state of health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and controlling their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
While there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect only extends to service providers in the health sector and insurance.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the data subject.
Another question is, of course, that the data subject can hardly deny access to his or her data, since the insurance companies do not otherwise conclude a contract with him or her.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the grace of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling trade
Since the European Union and India are each other’s leading trading partners, this was the main theme alongside other global issues at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian summit is also taking place, which is mainly discussed on cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic superpower that should be given more votes and the right to speak on international issues, Member States have not yet been able to agree whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement has been reached to double the trade to 100 million euros in the next five years.
Given the fact that the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this objective is not even that ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India were also incorporated into a legal agreement, so that in the future air traffic will also be affluent.
By 2009, India wants to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to create a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: While the Union of Partners is India’s number one, New Delhi is only ranked nine among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concern.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides guilty of failure.
The EU stressed that it adheres to its energy and climate programme, which means that emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed to this, as well as the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in the price of food should also be combated, which is why both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian head of government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, there is hope for orders from French companies worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be decided on for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expected to host more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will be distributed over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour of the event.
Undersecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 sqm exhibition space “Punto Italia”.
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room Structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives about publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers is decreasing in the whole, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
One year ago, billionaire Steve Fossett’s small plane was recovered.
Steve Fossett's miniplane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, on a flight over the Nevada desert, was found.
The parts have been found on a plateau of 3000 m high, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
The Madera County Sheriff, John Anderson, fully cleared the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been localized to which a troop has been sent. Now we have the assurance that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Safety (NTSB) announced that a team had been dispatched a few hours after the sighting of the plane, which identified the machine on it: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett flew to a flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, some of Fossett's personal belongings were also found in California, near the Nevada border, by a couple near their house on Mammoth Lakes.
These are two IDs named Fossetts, both of which were issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had taken a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002, he was the first person to circumnavigate the globe in a hot air balloon: a two-week, solitary flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without landing with a plane.
Among its many records is also a height flight of 15445 m over the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Look at the ads you didn’t expect
A suv, which is due to its original design and special line guide, the discharge surface and its clear angle from the traditional schemata.
With this offroader, Mercedes-Benz has tried to take a new breath into the sector.
Precisely because of its exceptional characteristics, the idea of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen from October 17 in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz.
The promotional drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the automotive sector in the rear of Italy.
A project with a high cost, to be carried out in different phases, which will take the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will seemingly emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details at different moments, in order to put itself together again as a whole.
Without a doubt, Mercedes’ interest with this ad is to introduce a new kind of car advertising into this rather stereotyped field.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
It is now clear who the Italian Hooligans are.
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk a stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been travelling behind the Italian national team for years, and which, to be honest, until recently did not cause serious problems.
There has never been a clash with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right environment.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia joined in Sofia.
They wear the tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: they were however removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a clash with a truly right-wing-radical fan scene, that of Levski.
From the Figc, 144 cards had been made available to the Italian fans for the game: all were on display in name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also completely controlled by the Viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who had already been pre-loaded in this regard, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to initiate further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified typhus can count on a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums across Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put one foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of replicators, which could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and such behavior will not in any case give the opportunity to justify it," the viminal said.
Therefore, "eyes on above all also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Because actually there is a small core of Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sports Supervision) gathers on Tuesday the casms, which can count on a part of the aice, i.e. the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce call and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed in no joy) who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francesco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of the Ultras Italia founded in 2002 comes from.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but undoubtedly the behavior of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
“I am not a sociologist,” adds the Osservatorio’s No. 1 – “crimes are committed in the country of their actions.
So far, this group had been stuck in the fence, but now we have to rethink what has happened and will happen.
But let us also talk about the pipes during the hymn Mamelis: this too is not a crime, but let me allow them, because education is lacking...".
