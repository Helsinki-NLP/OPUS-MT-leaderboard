Mr. Suzuki teaches us English.
What is the best way to travel?
Does Tom live here with you?
What's the matter, dear?
I don't want them to be angry.
Is Tom really sick?
She didn't wash her hair.
I read your letter yesterday.
He goes to the supermarket once a week.
Can I marry my aunt's husband's nephew?
I believe you.
She was amused by her son's snoring.
I said it was okay.
I have no reason not to trust Tom.
He was the first to help her.
Are the kids already asleep?
We have to wait here.
I'm Chinese.
Tom was not very active.
We cleared the road from the snow yesterday.
I'm not busy right now.
Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe he should listen.
He is a brilliant artist.
Take a step, guys.
I like your painting.
I waited for an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom is so sad.
I want to share this with you.
Study at the University of Hyogo.
We will participate in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life went on smoothly.
No one wants to help us.
They speak very quickly.
Tom was lucky at first.
It is urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He had no money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there many sharks on this side?
Tomorrow, if God wills, we'll be with your parents.
It comes from Sweden.
He had no money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe it?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like fish with squid.
I feel protected.
You're the highest.
Isn't this funny, Tom?
Tom was born on October 20th.
It's a beautiful photograph.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom has to sleep now.
Tom is not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Tom works here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I have no plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic all the time!
She was crying.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We had fun.
It's dishonest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got angry.
I'm already old.
I have a dirty criminal record.
Good night, my friends.
I bought a book in English in a bookstore.
Tomorrow I'm going to the bookstore to buy books.
What would the world be like without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom's saying?
What is your favorite historical film?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Everybody go.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I'm being followed.
Don't say things like that.
From bad to worse!
Jim is Canadian.
You've done well here.
Where have all the others gone?
I'm relaxed.
The cattle were grazing in the field.
He intervened in his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for an appointment.
Tom is still absent.
I ate all the apple.
Roast the bhakri while the pot is heated.
Is the park open today?
We only prepare Uyghur food.
We're leaving Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom was playing football.
Stop whining about it.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I understood it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not an appointment.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
It's good in this game, isn't it?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
It doesn't seem too surprising.
I don't go to school on Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom's unfaithful, isn't he?
Does this cage have the purpose of protecting against sharks?
Tom wants to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
You don't want a job?
I played the trombone when I was younger.
I'm loyal.
To write in braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I caught him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You need to become more active.
Tom and Mary are kidding?
It's broken from smoking.
I have no alternative.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than he is.
What will he do this summer?
I'm so irritated.
Did you talk to Shanghaiese?
It's narrowed down because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what had happened to Mary.
Something bad has happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
Am I in London?
She's still there with her, isn't she?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a big appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
What is your favorite female rapper?
Hey, Tom, bye.
It's nice to see her so happy.
I usually swim in the summer.
Why are you leaving soon?
I'm pretty proud of it.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's a picture of him.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom is lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a conference.
There are no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for the lesson.
It's a little overweight, isn't it?
Who's the man who's playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spent all his income on drinking.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Do you look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I don't have feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a lonely island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When is your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
It's snowing today.
He promised to write to me every week.
I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love being right.
Tom married a rich Boston girl.
I forgot if I drank wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50 grand for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I intend to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please, tell him to break up.
Tom hates them.
I get bored almost every day.
I won't apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't spoken to him yet.
It was a hot summer evening.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He searched his bag for the keys to the car.
I don't really want to talk.
So you must be Argentinian.
I really like my job.
I'd suggest you be more careful.
It's shocking.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
No one wants to help you.
It will clear in the afternoon.
He became blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you picture when you look at that picture?
How many continents are there in the world?
It's good to sing, isn't it?
Tom's mad at Mary, isn't he?
His idea is superior to his.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.
Tom has a secret.
We're losing blood.
Chaucer and Boccaccio are two writers. The first is English, the second is Italian.
Tom's getting emotional.
I was just scared.
Tomorrow's a party.
I had too much beer yesterday.
I'd like to teach you Chinese in exchange for another language.
I'm still busy.
I appreciate your intuitions.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom loves fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary is jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still asleep.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but it's what you want.
Could you ask Tom to stop after work?
He plays the drums.
It must be hot.
Which online dictionary do you use the most?
You lit the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before coming to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.
German cars are among the best.
Call me.
What a mess.
Tom doesn't respect Maria's views.
She plowed the field.
He came to listen to jazz.
Do you really think Tom's beautiful?
I can't give Mary anything she wants.
When does school end?
Tom and I are pretty busy.
I've been busy.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I might know someone who can help you.
Are you going on a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a model.
She brought me a cup of sugar-free tea.
It was published in 1969.
We've got to relax, that's all.
He speaks Chinese.
Tom told me he wants to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I have three more years than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I said he was innocent.
Fear of failure is one of the most common fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you ever have anything to say?
Scandals!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue shut.
I drank the wine.
He is more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're back in advance.
We left this.
All I want is to go fishing.
You want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can choose whatever you want.
I'm at the hospital, I've been hit by a lightning bolt.
Did you call them?
Turn off the radio.
Why did she decide to become a teacher?
It was a really scary story.
It's in the van.
I'm not introducing them.
Do you like golf?
Forgive me for interrupting the other day.
Can you believe us? We are in Europe!
You waited for a bus to arrive.
I found the coffin.
You'll never guess where they are.
I wasn't well.
You students are required to be diligent.
I won't be able to help them.
It's a scandalous idea!
The sun disappears behind a cloud.
You are interested in politics.
Many people go to church on Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my daughter.
I don't know how to drive very well.
I hear Tom's learning to drive.
You know I love her deeply.
He's trying to kill himself.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is, we don't know where Tom is.
He's under the bed, isn't he?
I knocked down the branch with an axe.
The minivans are back in fashion.
There are some books on the table.
At least come at six.
I have a lot of work to finish by the weekend.
He forgot his name.
Are you Mary?
After dinner walk on the beach.
Why didn't he go with him?
He's two years older than him.
French is difficult.
I'm sure she's very busy.
My name is Ahmad.
You got the wrong number.
Age is not a result, and youth is not a sin.
I've known him for over ten years.
We are grateful for the music that has left us.
It’s not that the idea of putting an ammonia household appliance in my house attracts me a lot.
Judy is a very smart student.
We knew the dog would run behind the cat.
I'm a cop.
You kissed her, didn't you?
Why don't I buy her a hat and that's enough?
I thought Tom would be alive.
You're crazy about the bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom's my dad.
We don't have to leave yet.
Do you like the mountain?
My daughter likes to play with dolls.
Come on board.
You're charming.
Do people drink tea in their own country?
I don't want to waste any more time.
We lost sight of him.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
Go and wake them up.
Which tooth hurts?
You have to read between the lines.
Tom was proud.
Tom was a little confused by Mary's request.
I'm here to help him.
It is not easy to speak English well.
I don't believe a word of what you say.
Get off your back!
Only Naoko drinks coffee.
Sami needed to use the bathroom.
He changed his name.
You're vulgar.
Tom's getting better.
We can help them.
They called us.
I think Tom should be hungry.
The country is rich in natural resources.
It was a difficult start for Mary.
Tom won't be back today.
She's back!
Why do these things always happen to me?
The birds are plunging the ground.
The park is closed on Monday.
Didn't even update the firmware?
I got a job for you.
This is just a game.
Can we do it now?
I like all my friends.
I like my language.
Why won't you answer me?
We're Tom's classmates.
There's nothing better to do.
Tom started writing.
That's what I'm looking for.
He's practicing.
You're coming in?
Which way should I start?
Have you studied Darwin's theory of evolution?
His horse had a heart attack.
It is worth visiting the ruins.
He should be ready for the worst.
Tom pulled the bags out of the trunk.
This reminds me of someone.
I'm so hungry.
Tom lost his new watch.
Tom sang with Mary.
Is that what you told Tom?
Do you remember his plate number?
He told us a lie.
She has seven children.
Let’s listen to music.
I think it's dangerous for kids to play in the pond.
You bought me a nice coat.
The bell played.
Bring it to the men in room 318.
I'm falling in love with her.
We must postpone our departure.
Tom doesn't even care.
We were separated.
It's early.
You saved Tom's life twice.
I don’t like big cities.
This happened to me.
He has many friends in America.
I didn't live in Boston last year.
Do you read this book tonight?
Tom has a car?
I'll be fine, don't worry.
Tom rarely laughs.
I can't forget his smile.
I disobeyed him.
Do you know any Canadians living in Australia?
Tom's boring, isn't he?
I'm perfectly happy here.
Do you like it?
What exactly do you want me to do, Tom?
Listen, we need to talk.
Tom didn't like it very much.
Could you wash the dishes, please?
The lunch was great.
You turned off the computer.
Torture is against the law.
I remember it.
It's not impossible.
What do you want me to do?
She had to share a bedroom with her sister.
I heard the door close.
He made him drunk.
How are you feeling today?
Would you be interested in working for me?
It reminds me of my childhood.
Mary and Alice were like sisters.
Tom arrived in Boston last night.
You're under arrest.
I don't feel nervous.
You have a beautiful dog.
What do you really want to do?
Tom didn't even read Mary's letter.
They were perfect.
What are you going to do this summer?
You're going to my house.
But the fox with his jump has reached the quiet Fido.
Tom is engaged to my older sister.
My father always hangs out in my private life.
Everyone wants something different.
Tom refused to execute the order.
I know you don't like them.
I didn't know about his plan.
Why don't you go back to Boston?
I don't want to be away from home.
What does it mean to go for a walk after dinner?
Fight like a man!
Tom and Mary sing?
Is Tom and Mary okay?
Hiring is common in the markets.
They shot him.
We're sorry about the inconvenience.

I don't want you to see this.
How many reindeer does a human have?
A saved money is a earned money.
We're not cold.
We need to talk to him.
I know his name.
It's gone with red.
Don't disturb them.
We were good.
She began to behave strangely.
You should ask Tom to help.
Who sent the flowers?
Do I owe you money?
Would you like me to go?
You left this, didn't you?
Tell us something.
You're random.
Please lower the music.
I trained Tom for the job.
He watched him swim.
Who broke the glass?
You'd better go with him.
The queen visited the museum.
Tom didn't go, and neither did I.
Would you like to leave a message?
The children played together.
Say it again, please.
You're disturbing her.
Sami's not here to ruin your day.
I took off my shoes.
I'm learning Esperanto now.
He hired mercenaries to kill Sami.
Is that yours?
The woman is drinking water now.
Tom was a lawyer.
People here are demanding about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is inexpensive, it will close soon if the food does not taste good.
The man Tom and Mary are talking to is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He's a man of words.
I'm free tonight.
You think I'm too tall?
What should we do now?
Tom tried a new technique.
You guys were ambushed?
Are you interested?
Tom cut off his wrists.
You seem relieved.
You should have kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.
I'm looking for my keys.
Will you join our club?
Don't fire Tom.
He's not listening.
I bought it in a used store.
Why don't you do it yourself?
It's finally here!
Tom thinks everyone's gonna be here by noon.
Why don't you work with me anymore?
It doesn't make any sense.
You're lying.
You helped him.
Everyone was talking about it.
You're telling me you're not busy?
He hates bullies.
Go home.
Tom told me Mary was engaged.
Where's my money?
Nobody's seen her do it.
Tom hasn't read any of these books.
You're still inexperienced.
I have to go to work now.
You came too soon.
It is capable of speaking ten languages.
Come home before it gets dark.
I got off the train at the wrong station.
I hated French in high school.
Shouldn't you be home with your mother?
She has blue eyes and blonde hair.
I can't figure it out.
Tell him who you are.
My name sounds weird.
I'll never forget that night.
Be happy! Add an exclamation point to all your phrases!
Can you see anything in there?
You guys are ready.
Why should I talk to them?
I won't forget.
I don't want to forget her.
I can't open it!
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
I bought a pair of shoes.
I started working here in 2013.
They are traitors.
I'll stay.
I'm not always busy.
I'll assist you.
I got up before dawn.
I'll be right behind you.
How long have you lived in Kobe?
We're getting closer.
Tom always says the same thing.
Did you talk to Tom?
Try to rest for a while.
Do you have a Facebook account?
He asked how to cook the fish.
No one will believe his story.
Tom is a golden boy.
It seems to be prevented against ideas coming from foreign countries.
I bought that book for him.
I didn't mean to hit Tom so hard.
You make me vomit.
I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll know her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Complete the sentence.
The clock is broken.
I won't wait forever.
Just give me the order.
Do you know of Canadians living in Australia?
This book is much more interesting than that.
We were obliged to obey the rule.
I hope Tom's not angry.
The rock was moved with dynamite.
Mary prepared the breakfast.
Where did you meet my father?
Who was Mona Lisa?
He said he has to go.
You can hold them.
This smell is unbearable.
She became famous.
What are you indicating?
I became friends with him while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by his intelligence.
You've got the ball.
We have to go.
Staying home is no fun.
I'm sure Tom will be awake.
She can't find her hat.
Mr. Young would like his son to study more.
I opened an account at a bank nearby.
I didn't like that one.
Can you be sure?
I was glad to see her.
You don't have to worry.
We'll be close.
I'm really worried about them.
He clearly wants to go.
I knew Tom would do something romantic.
How many cards do you need?
Can you confirm it?
It was a waste of money.
Tom's talking to Mary on the phone.
Bring the wine.
I was very proud.
You're very fast.
How about a beer?
I had no idea you guys were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You're a brave man.
Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one coin.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a moment.
Let's eat together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the picture down.
You are my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where'd you have lunch?
He's the last person who can tell a lie.
June isn’t that far away either.
Why do you hate Tom so much?
You know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He kicked me out of the house.
My shoes were wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you about to leave me?
You've always liked Tom.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, OK?
You wanted to ask me questions?
Don't play Tom.
You'll land on your feet.
I've been taking risks.
Two people were killed in a road accident.
You know Tom, right?
It wasn't my idea to hire them.
Last night my grandmother went missing without suffering.
I know the reason you're angry with them.
You know Tom likes cars.
You passed the exam.
Tom imitated Mary.
I can easily read Spanish.
Do I have to use ink?
Don't fall off the chair.
Tom sent us Christmas presents.
Tom can't swim?
Children usually get up early at Christmas.
I'll be your guide.
How long do you study English every day?
Why does he look uncomfortable?
I can't do anything for her.
The father is good.
I think they're ready.
Tom will try it again.
What a wonderful woman!
They played a table game.
They all believed him.
It means a huge increase in the use of air conditioning, which uses energy, costs money and creates pollution.
I'm a drug addict.
Those are crocodile tears.
He could have said something before.
The work leaves traces on Tatoeba...
Do you like carrots?
I'm sick every 30 minutes.
Tom is much older now.
Tom's better.
I think Tom's pessimistic.
You have to help them.
Sometimes I write to my mother.
You don't trust anyone.
I'm sorry I've never been kind to him.
Make Tom call me.
It hasn't changed anything.
She's not wearing her hat.
Tom actually apologized to Mary.
Why doesn't he sit with me anymore?
I want you to look for them.
I left the party too soon.
I should have eaten more.
Of the 20 students, only one read the book.
To love someone means to see it as God had meant it.
Don't lie to them.
Do they live with her?
I don't know how he did this.
I'm not sure George will like this idea.
They are afraid to say it publicly.
Please identify yourself.
Leave us alone.
It would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains.
I lost it.
I almost dropped the dishes.
There's a phone in my room.
Is it serious?
Tom made the 911.
We are brother and sister.
Are you interested in Buddhism?
This week has been beautiful.
You want a tray with that?
You don't know me.
Nobody wants to work.
Please drive more slowly.
How do we fix it?
This is last month's magazine.
They're not back yet.
He's about your age, isn't he?
He's in retreat.
We can't let them die.
It's a bundle of nerves.
Tom arrived late.
Tom was left behind.
This point will be discussed tomorrow.
How did he spend his vacation?
When he left the Army, Roger Miller moved to the country music house in Nashville, Tennessee.
Mary corrected it.
Have you ever talked to him?
I don't think Tom will be able to do that.
When are you coming back from London?
Tom is always a good guy.
Can I get you some coffee?
He left the village to study.
I've never seen you dance.
Tom nodded for a closer look.
Can you save them?
So you and Hanna are thinking about getting married?
You can drive, right?
They need us to finish the job.
I've been here twice now.
It looks so fake.
They're all dead.
I don't want you in my car.
A snake bites Tom.
You don't care.
Don't say anything!
I think you're right.
He likes football.
Tom lives next to Mary.
I have to go to Boston next week.
Show them how you do it.
What is your favorite fruit?
Do you like golf?
What is your favorite type of pizza?
He's not very good at his job.
Bob has a lot of books in his room.
They followed Tom.
The ship disappears to the horizon.
Of course you said a lie.
There was something going on.
Send it by mail.
It's interesting, isn't it?
Mary accidentally bumped into Tom.
I'm nobody's enemy.
I forgot his number.
The two teams fought very hard.
I think there's a mistake in my account.
Tom didn't convince me.
Sami had some painful secrets.
You want me to be frank?
What are you gonna do?
Tom seems tired, bring him home, for pleasure.
May all your wishes come true!
She's already done it.
He is experienced with a word processor.
He was at the gate of death.
You're hurt, aren't you?
Your table is ready.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?
Tom and Mary have a car, right?
Now let's talk.
I can't solve this problem.
He hit her in the head.
