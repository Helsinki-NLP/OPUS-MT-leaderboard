Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned about "making the figure of the clowns"
Some members of the House of Commons are being coerced against the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This proposal was created as a result of the programmes to change the name of the Assembly in the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the entire political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his party is concerned that "it can rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who do not live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means cretin and pwp means cuckoo.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said he was "open" to the name change, but stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet.
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is pronounced in a manner similar to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The assembly committee, which is currently in the drafting phase for the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of how the members of the assembly will be called will obviously be a topic of debate for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed broad support for the possibility of calling the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of the members of the Assembly, the Commission expressed its preference for Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option received greater consent in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching the consensus could prove to be a gratuitous tip for President Elin Jones, who is expected to present a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform law will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will get the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
The Macedonians go to the polls for the referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to "North Macedonia."
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to end a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for the name change, said he would not consider the outcome of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's shake while the churches of Harlem are in trouble
“The elders I spoke to say that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
"Today there's none of them."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he explained.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood lounges that people regularly attend.”
As for churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will go back to where they started."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the type of people who won’t help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white,” he says, “and for that reason they will hasten the moment when these churches will close completely because it is unlikely that much of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by fraternities before Harlem became a black neighborhood – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation went away in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin’s was acquired by a black congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott against the 125th Street retailers, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote people of color.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners were planning its reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a color musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged at St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by church lay officials, others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July concerning its concerns that the diocese "trying to unload the costs" on the parish assembly although the latter had not been in the diocesan
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Wounds 13-Year-Old in California Peanut Fishing Dive
Official sources say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving in California for peanuts on the opening day of the peanut season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that for half an hour he had been immersing himself with friends Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming and swimming up to him with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was only enthusiasm due to catching a peanut but then “he realized that the boy was screaming ‘I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His whole clavicle was lacerated," he said of noticing Hammel once he reached the boy.
“I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was hospitalized in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles said in a statement to the media that a few weeks earlier a shark had been spotted in the area, but that it had been declared not belonging to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper chest area.
Authorities have blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to boost the beauty products sector in the UK
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with courses dedicated to the beauty products of the large warehouse assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty product market push, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and home goods sectors decline, the largest beauty product courses will be tested in 11 stores across the country and adopted in more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are hunting for new ways to use the space on the shelves once dedicated to TVs, microwaves and homewares.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the size of its beauty product offering to reach 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with branded areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its range of Boutique tricks so that most of the products are vegan - a quality increasingly demanded by younger buyers.
In addition, fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will test the permits at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, while a second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food products daily at small neighborhood stores have forced supermarkets to make more efforts to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the outlets will look more and more like large warehouses as the supermarket chain tries to resist discounts like Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and also introduced several Habitats since it bought the two chains about two years ago, and such a strategy has boosted food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to restore enamel to its beauty and pharmaceutical departments ended in a failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenues from pharmaceutical outlets in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-point pharmaceutical business three years ago to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
Lloyds was expected to play a role in the program, with the addition in four stores of an extensive range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Commercial Director, said: "We have transformed the look of our beauty product departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and inviting environment and comfortable positions make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is “crazy” after Holly Willoughby walks out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with her trending brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby no longer has time for his brand of Home Appliances and Truly accessories.
The couple's activity was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning’s host, 37, used Instagram to announce her resignation.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious after retiring from their lucrative last-minute trending brand activity to focus on her new exceptional contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was "crazy" when the golden girl on TV admitted during a tense meeting at the headquarters of her trading empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - did not leave her home enough time to spend on them.
The activity was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop's Goop brand and it had been calculated that it would double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at around <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As soon as Willoughby, 37, chose Instagram to announce his abandonment of Truly, Jones left Britain to head to one of his holiday residences.
According to one source: “Trily was undoubtedly Holly’s top priority.
It had to be her long-term future that would have engaged her for the next twenty years.
His decision to leave has left all the people involved absolutely speechless.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There’s a full warehouse of products at Marlow’s headquarters, ready to be sold.”
Experts believe that the abandonment of the presenter of This Morning, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to strong investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays in the brand’s launch.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent the holidays together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity" program.
A source close to Jones said last night that "he doesn't want to release comments on his business."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media to make a comment that some would consider “non-presidential” and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice imitating the “telejournalist.”
"I didn't give up anything."
He stressed that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a huge step forward towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders during the UN General Assembly held on Saturday, that North Korea did not observe an "equivalent response" from the US to North Korea's first disarmament operations.
Instead, he stressed, the US is continuing to impose sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
“With North Korea we are getting great results,” he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages, and the return of the last US military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
“It’s simple to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded field, we’d have about 200 people right here in front of us,” Trump said, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, causing hundreds of victims
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had been displaced, the national emergency had not been declared, an essential requirement for activating international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it’s a bit complicated,” Sumbang said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team that will go to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid.
Considering the earthquakes to which Indonesia is continually subjected, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the fury of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not a common facility on other coasts.
The obvious lack of an alarm siren for the tsunamis in Palu, although the alarm had been given, probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
In the best conditions, moving between the numerous islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put at the centre of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia’s branded infrastructure and has poured money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funding affected Joko’s administration as he prepares for re-election next year.
Joko must also face pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of the religion.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes due to clashes on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, who fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool equals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea by a point in the 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 25 meters from Chelsea's door, with his team down 1-0.
He touched the left ball before shooting on the second pole.
The attempt went high above the door frame as it turned to the upper right corner of the network.
The ball finally fell behind Kepa Arrizabalaga getting into the net.
“Just try to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kant arrive and I gave a touch and I didn't think about it too much and I pulled it."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the 25th minute goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The centerpiece of the Blue passed by Mateo Kovacic before kicking off near the half of the field and shooting in the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick pass in the middle of the field.
So he made a beautiful pass that brought Hazard to the area.
Hazard overtook the defence and finished on the second pole with a left-back goal beyond Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League round at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of earthquake and tsunami victims in Indonesia has reached 832, the country’s disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
Numerous people have been reported trapped among the rubble of the collapsed buildings following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and that generated waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been ravaged by debris from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman’s body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds to Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have invited people who may have seen or heard something in the area to get in touch.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just in the beginning but I would like to appeal to anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious and invite them to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on dashcam, so that they can contact us because they may have very important information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman came to the crime scene to ask questions about the whereabouts this morning.
Investigations are ongoing and police said they are currently informing the victim’s family members.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment but was told by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told it will take hours before they are allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area is now considered a scene of the crime.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
He continues to say, “It’s terrible.”
At 2 p.m. two police vans were inside the demarcated area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were inside the demarcated area controlling the apartment building.
Anyone with information about this is invited to contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 of September 30.
Parliament’s Cromwell statue becomes the last monument hit by a wave of “history rewriting”
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England executed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society has called Crick’s proposal a “foolish” and an “attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster became a target.
The iconoclast during the English Civil Wars was not ordered or conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell's Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament from external pressures, in his case of course of monarchy.
That it is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure that represents a part of such a fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Swine killer kidnaps a Chinese farmer by killing him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a receding artery, covered in blood near a pig at Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs at a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said that in the pig there was a large male pig with blood on it.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250 kg pig had grazed the breeder, according to the statements.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and bruises,” said the cousin identified with the surname “Wu,” as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40pm on Thursday to give food to his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people, while police gather evidence on the crime scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating a refund for the farmer’s death.
Although rare, cases of attacks on humans by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram-pound pig instilled a Welsh farmer in his tractor until his wife managed to chase the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was devoured by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a “catalyst.”
“They just want to play.
They're playful, very curious... they don't want to hurt.
Just show them the right amount of respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa’s landslides will bring heavy rain in the southwestern United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves on the colder waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains on northern Mexico and on the southwestern coast of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds of up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane at 5 ET on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a squall is forming over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push a strong tropical humidity north, in the southwestern part of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
So, the tropical humidity in contact with the nearby saccharation will create heavy and extensive rainfall in the southwestern area in the coming days.
At the local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain can cause dangerous sudden floods, streams of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2.5-7.5 cm per hour at some points, particularly in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2.5-10 cm is expected in some areas of the southwest, particularly in much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding may occur with rapidly worsening conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly advised to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
The heavy rains could make the river canyons full, and the storms will bring wind gusts and lift dust.
The impending sacking will cause heavy rain locally on part of the southern California coast.
Rainfall of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of debris and slippery slopes.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona toward the end of Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more widespread at the end of Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rain will fall on the Four Corners on Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong fluctuations in temperatures in the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant temperature changes over short distances.
An exceptional example of significant temperature differences in the central U.S. will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 20 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the residual heat of the summer will try to increase and expand again.
A warm beginning of October is expected for most of the central and eastern United States, with 26 oC from the Southern Plains to the northeastern areas.
In New York you will be able to reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is a temperature of about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above average for the United States of America until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people followed on Thursday on six television networks the compelling deposition by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming for a last-minute Friday turnaround: an agreement devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to have the FBI conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford informed the Senate Judiciary Commission that it is 100% certain that Kavanaugh slapped her in drunk state and tried to strip her during a senior party.
Kavanaugh, during a heated deposition, said he was 100% sure this didn’t happen.
More than 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen on Friday are likely to have followed the deposition.
The company was calculating the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has a hard time counting the viewers who follow the programs in the offices.
To put everything in perspective, this is an audience similar to that for a football playoff game or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose critics have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, has led all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day’s audience, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office released a statement saying it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake was picked up by CNN and CBS operatives Friday morning as he was insulted by protesters as he tried to take an elevator to a hearing room.
He kept his eyes low for several minutes while being reprimanded and broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think you’re telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "She has power while many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued the statement and stated, before the elevator closes, that he would have other things to say during the committee hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters broadcast live a few hours later, when the Justice Commission voted to present Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the certainty that the FBI would analyze the charges against the candidate over the next week, as requested by minority Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'making politics' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused those who criticize her programs of letting the European Union "face politics" with Britain's future and jeopardises national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another side-by-side interview with the prime minister on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Brexit Chequers deal, stating that a proposal that Britain and the EU must "compulsively collect their respective duties is"
Murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect in death of LSU player Dyteon Simpson
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and taken to prison on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities have released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the litigation.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB television station affiliated with CBS reported.
After questioning Simpson, the police said the suspect admitted to accidentally shooting Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, the defense attorney said.
The office of the East Baton Rouge legal physician issued a preliminary report Friday, in which it states that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department has recognized the merit of the task force for the Louisiana State Police Escapes, the police scientist’s laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens of the area who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of LSU thanked the local law enforcement for their commitment and the pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade stated that the team is "involved" and "under shock" for Wayde's death.
“This is what you worry about at all times,” Wade said.
Vulcano cosparge of ash Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity had increased in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions had been recorded in 24 hours.
The center was controlling the various breakages and shocks.
Images on social media showed thin ash layers lining the car windshields in Mexico City’s neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity corresponding to the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police teams and thousands of people joined demonstrations by opponents to commemorate the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists obstructed by the riot police targeted police officers with eggs and threw dust paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that usually overflow tourists.
There have been further clashes over the course of the day with police officers who have resorted to manganese to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independents singing "We will not forget, we will not forgive" confronted the Unionist demonstrators shouting "Long Life to Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to receive treatment for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
Tensions remain high in the independent region one year after the October 1 referendum considered illegal by the Madrid government but recognized by Catalan separatists.
The voters had voted with a crushing majority for independence, although the affluence was low, and the Catalans against secession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people reported injuries last year after police tried to stop the referendum that was taking place at seats across the region with violent clashes.
The independent groups had camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said he no longer had hopes of Catalonia becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for the opportunity to vote, but now everything is blocked,” he explained.
Despite having achieved a fundamental victory despite measuring the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to keep up the momentum this year, with many of the movement's most well-known leaders being incarcerated or incarcerated awaiting trial for their role in the impeachment.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest with his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians from both factions.
“The situation is getting more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced that he will run for the European Parliament elections next year.
“Presenting me as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the involution of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after spying on a house by car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly bumped into a Londonderry home with a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, at about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the machine was hit with a ballast at some point.
Menga's attack marks Livingston's 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston sealed the win
The already promoted Livingston left the Rangers stunned by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 games as head of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference while Gary Holt's team moved to the second division with Hibernian.
Gerrard’s team therefore remains without a home win in the Premiership this season and will have to face the first in the Hearts rankings next Sunday, from which they are separated by 8 points.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues his division winning streak by remaining unbeaten for six games, with coach Holt still having to see a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston wastes opportunity against incisive guests
Holt's team should have been in favor well before the goal, with their immediacy that caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson collapsed but dragged his action in front of the door mirror and Alan Lithgow was only able to kick out the door after getting in to meet Craig Halkett's headshot from across the door.
The guests were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could have put visitors in trouble with pitching.
And that’s how the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers conceded a penalty kick and Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to move to Menga, which was able to score from the center of the area.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball but the defending host team had proved impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much.
This scheme was maintained during the second half, although Alfredo Morelos engaged Kelly in a parade.
Scott Pittman saw his goal attempt stopped at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow shot him out of another Livingston game schedule.
Crossings took place in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two strict requests, after Halkett's contrast with substitute Glenn Middleton and one by default, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they were exceptional, continuing to exceed expectations along this exceptional trajectory.
Their playing style and collaborators have changed very little since their return to the top of the series, but you have to give Holt a lot of credit for the way he has been able to spur the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, led by a masterfully organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were uninspired.
Despite the excellent performance at times with Gerrard, in this case they fell well below those standards.
The last step is missing - only once they have managed to penetrate the opponent's area - and you can consider an alarm bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the rankings.
Erdogan received with contrasting reactions in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29th) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at extending relations between NATO allies.
They clashed over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne for the inauguration of a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police motivated the intervention with security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, including numerous Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The protests mirror the dissent caused by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks in Germany and called a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with a car
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The incident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the south-eastern area of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived at the scene, but the man died on the hit.
The accident happened months after another cyclist died, invested by a street pirate in Childers Street, about a mile from where the accident occurred on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said the authorities were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses were diverted and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Wounded Guards During a Disorder
Six prison guards were injured during a riot at the highest-security male prison, the prison’s office said.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin’s highest-security male prison in Worcestershire at about 9:30 a.m. BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
The specialized "Tornado" agents were employed to manage the riot, which involves eight prisoners and which is confined to a prison wing.
The agents were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to contain an incident currently underway at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer prison sentence."
The Long Lartin prison is home to over 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had to receive hospital care following the attack of a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-smooth agents were called in to intervene in the prison to sedate a violent riot during which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which could benefit areas affected by drought)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week when the latest energies of Hurricane Rosa will cross the southwest of the desert, creating risks of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated peaks up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest area, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will receive from 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated peaks up to 10 cm.
For foreign areas at risk of sudden flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these rainfalls will likely be positive as the southwestern area is currently undergoing a period of drought.
According to the Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category,” weather.com reported.
Initially, the path of Hurricane Rosa will be able to land on land through the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who still maintained hurricane strength Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with the colder waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected to arrive in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or on Monday evening.
Precipitation on parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high risk of flooding.
"We expect rainfall between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the northwest area of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a state of tropical depression, to then head through Arizona and south Utah late on Tuesday evening.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or her landslides is intense rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora area and the southwestern U.S. desert area," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that such rains could generate potentially deadly sudden floods and torrents of debris in the deserts, as well as landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys in a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 04:00 BST about Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he remains in "stable" conditions.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who may have taken back with the phone what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered from the Democratic Party's evil and anger"
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffering from the Democratic Party's badness and anger" during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh filed before Congress on Thursday, passionately denying and deciding on Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual violence against her decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford also filed a complaint with the court to defend himself against the charge.
The president said Saturday that "the American people were able to observe Kavanaugh's extraordinary quality and courage" on that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most expert law minds of our time, a lawyer with record-breaking precedents in the public service,” he said in front of the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment by talking about the importance of Republican affluence in midterm elections.
“Five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not a candidate, but I really do,” he said.
"For this batch strictly for exceptional candidates."
Trump said the Democrats are committed to “resisting and obstructing.”
The first fundamental procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia and the tsunami, and the death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many washed away by giant waves that hit the beaches, when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) high fell on the beach at dusk, wiping out many people killing them and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, thus becoming victims,” said Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster control agency BNPB.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit anything on the mainland," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people have climbed trees to escape the tsunami and have survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed numerous buildings and shops destroyed, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The shocks of settlement continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the strong earthquake on Friday was almost 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have enhanced the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be higher along the 300-km (190-mile) north coast of Palu, in an area called Donggala, closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
The communications "have been totally paralyzed, with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the areas involved.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious,” he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing it that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves arrived at the time the alarm was launched.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you hear a man on a top floor of a building screaming in a agitated way to warn of the tsunami coming people down the road below.
A few minutes after a water wall fell on the beach, wiping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
According to authorities, the army began sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescues and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to more than 800.
It's terrible.
Although Donggala’s World Vision staff managed to reach the city of Palu healthy and safe, where the employees took refuge under wax screen shelters in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they encountered scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's terrible.
Even as rescue groups began the difficult operations of launching rescue gears, there have been some complaints about the fact that foreign rescue workers with extensive knowledge were prevented from traveling to Palu.
Indonesian regulations stipulate that funding, provisions and staff from abroad can begin to arrive only if the site of a disaster has been declared an area of national catastrophe.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘O.K., this is a national disaster,’ we will be able to accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined.”
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of the dispersed still held the hopes that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was pulled out of a dump.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next door.
Gendon Subandano, the trainer of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the paragliding pilots disappeared.
Other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“As a veteran in the paragliding industry, I’m carrying my emotional load,” he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours following the news of the Roa Roa Hotel’s collapse within the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu’s competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages, however, stopped at a single sign of gray spurt rather than two blue signs.
“I think it means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was supplying a ATM to Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a ATM in the entertainment center and was preparing to hand over more money, said researcher Dennis McCarthy in the statement.
While he was busy, another man "sucked up behind Brink's employee" and stole a purse with the money destined for delivery.
Some witnesses identified several suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the identity of the offenders is invited to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On announcing the name change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change took place before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word contains for him a religious meaning.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'," West said at the beginning of the year, talking about the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
We have passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye - the reflection of our goodness, of our evilness, of our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are.”
He is just one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also changed the name with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military force against the civilian population on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
The soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were taking hold across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by raising monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities are driving young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for AI
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its funding for research in this field, says AI investor and operator Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of several US government groups regarding AI, although in the US there is generally a lack of a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its program last year: it aspires to be the No. 1 country in AI innovation by 2030.
“Redouble the budget in AI research would be a good start considering that all other countries are much further behind the U.S. and we need a new revolution in AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major success in the AI sector will be achieved in the U.S., Lee told CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the leading AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an AI system that beat the American Otello player with the highest score and subsequently was a leader at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be held to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking away academic leaders, it’s multinationals,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired lighting companies from universities to work on AI projects.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of AI.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to AI PhD students,” he said.
The Chinese State Council published its program for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, in a way similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funds to U.S. researchers, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities, and the White House announced the formation of a special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. order to create a National Commission for Artificial Intelligence Security has not been active for months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on a possible change of the country's name to the "North Macedonia Republic", a move that would resolve the decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its requests for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighbors is a claim on its territory and has vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments tightened a deal in June under the new name proposed, but nationalist opponents believe the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts about the possibility that the influx would reach the minimum of 50% required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot is as follows: "It agrees with NATO and EU membership and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is about the price to be paid for Macedonia to be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in favour.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters had expressed their vote.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a constituent of the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for a referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country that would open the door to NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Paramento in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and arranging the chairs in front of the tents assembled by those who want to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get to the top, not the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China or Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I think the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
He said a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum - a percentage below the required affluence.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, indicated that 57% of respondents expected to go to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 57% said they would vote for yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it settled in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero scores a goal avoiding Brighton's entire defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took care of Brighton's defense during a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem extremely easy his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the action.
He moved between three Brighton defenders before catapulting into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He humiliated one defender before overcoming several others at the edge of the Brighton area.
He then made a move to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-handed shot in the net.
“Aguero is having problems on his feet,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about having him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to score at that point.”
But it was Sterling who initially took advantage of the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in depth on the Brighton field.
He sent a nice filter ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
Sky Blues striker pulled the ball online shortly before leaving the field.
City will compete against Hoffenheim in the Champions League round at 12:55 am on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated by the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But as always competitive Scherzer hopes to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which maintain an advantage of a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least one rematch with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to get their title in the first division.
"Even if we play goalless, we can at least be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level of all this year.
Why shouldn’t I ever want to compete?”
The Nationals have yet to announce a first launcher for Sunday, but are said to be inclined to let Scherzer launch in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, held a launch session on Thursday and would be the first launcher in his normal Sunday break.
The Washington pitcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings for this season.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the influx of Republicans in midterm elections.
“Everything we did was put into play in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really getting used to it for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, “Let’s see this horrible group of radical democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any necessary means, you can see evil, wickedness.
They don’t care who they can hit, who they have to overwhelm in order to regain power and control, because that’s what they want, power and control, and we won’t give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have given themselves the mission of "resisting and obstructing."
“And it has been possible to see him in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “raised, bad, mean, and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, triggering strong public outcry.
“Do you remember his answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, um no, I'm waiting for a -- that was a bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
It does not tolerate people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it wasn’t a big surprise.
After all, they are the last of a series of Labour MPs to whom it was reported that they were not welcome, and all because they said what they thought.
My fellow Member, Mr Ryan, has received similar treatment because he has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically all topics similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday states that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the local Labour Party parliament, Friday evening meetings were exactly like that.
However, today this is not the tone of numerous meetings and the promise of a “more kind and courteous” policy has long been forgotten, if ever it has been remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged based on whether or not it is acceptable for party leadership.
This all started shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, and colleagues with whom I previously thought I would share a similar political vision began to expect a trend reversal on my part and that I would take positions that I would never accept, whether it was a national security or a single market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – I follow instigations of social media insults calling for my withdrawal, denouncing the policy of the centre and telling myself that I shouldn’t be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than other colleagues because the comments to me tend to be political in nature.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to face a stream of sexualist or racist insults every day but who do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insult levels.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every motion of distrust or modification of the rules of selection, the party is restricted.
In the last two years I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower my head, not to express my opinions so openly and everything "would be fine".
But that’s not what I came into politics to do.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, caused by the government’s slump Thatcher who had let my high school class literally fall apart, I’ve tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as local councillors or as government ministers.
I never hid my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way puzzled by my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will damage the family nucleus, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in reality the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of those I consider to be the best of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an unbeaten Ayr scales the ranking
Two late attempts may have somehow unbalanced the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved the victory in this exceptionally fun match of Tennent's championship day.
They're now at the top of the standings, the only team out of ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their audacity, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had every reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still batting, so I have to be happy," he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said: “You have to recognize Ayr’s merit, they have taken better advantage of our opportunities.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute goal, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought the Ayr in advantage, but a yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot grabbed a non-converted goal.
Climo increased the distance of the Ayr with a rigour before, just in half time, to score and then convert a goal alone to take the Ayr to 17-5 in the interval.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson’s goal, converted by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
There was therefore a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was extended, and upon restart, the Ayr jumped again in advantage thanks to a goal by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The deputy captain of the Ayr Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose made the man pay extra with an unconverted goal from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of high pressure.
However, the home team is back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a contrast with Climo without the ball, from the touch of rigor, MacPherson scored a touch down behind the Ayr's advancing mix.
Climo converted, as he had already done almost since the restart, after Rowe had picked up football from David Armstrong's area and sent flanker Gregor Henry to look for the fifth goal of the home team.
Star of Still Game is looking for a new career in the catering industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran has decided to move to the hotel industry after discovering that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor portrays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, which he co-wrote and plays alongside longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple has announced that the next ninth series will also be the final one of the show and it looks like Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to make statements, although a source from the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous catering trade."
''The sea is ours'': Bolivia unexploded on the sea hopes a court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors patrol a sartiam-clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings display an ocean blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is our right.
To recover it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia without a discharge to the sea, the memory of the lost coast and now in the hands of Chile after a bloody conflict over the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to once again soak up the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have reached their highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and obviously is waiting for the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Court of the Hague welcomes Bolivia's claim that - after decades of intermittent dialogue - Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia's jurisdiction over the Strait.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president — who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year — has a lot to do with Monday’s ruling.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly decide in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate the Chilean territory and has specified that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the final rounds indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years could have delayed it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morale’s belligerent rhetoric has thwarted any remaining good intentions from Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at some point, but it will be very difficult to maintain the discussions as a result of what happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was particularly swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will be able to "enjoy extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual advantage," he said.
Calzadilla has also denied he Morales – one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – is using the maritime issue as a political escamote.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen without trust in the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never carry out nuclear disarmament if it could not trust Washington first.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to keep faith in the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be intent on restarting stalled diplomatic negotiations after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
She explains that it is an “illustration” that the continuation of sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never put North Korea on its knees.
Washington hesitates to issue the declaration without Pyongyang first taking important disarmament actions.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s intention to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows have the latest trend in huge caps that will soon be in a high-fashion store near you
If you want to expand your collection of caps or completely block the sun’s rays, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed on the runway a series of crazy oversized caps for their spring-summer 2019 collection that have impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have made Instagram furious this summer and these stylists have sent their captivating creations on the runway.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige-colored hat decorated with a large feather-like edge that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled acorns, a witch hat and even a pineapple - but they weren't designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks have sewn lips and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a full for immersion with mask and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cone.
And if you continue with the huge style statements, you are lucky.
Viewers of the style predict that huge hats could reach you on the streets of high fashion.
The outsize hats arrive on the track of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a wide over a meter that has been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that has invaded social media has sent another huge creation into the walkway: a beach bag in large straw almost as much as the costume model that wears it.
The bag in burnt orange raffle, finished with raffle in raffle and with a white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera's 2019 spring-summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect these great hats and beach bags to arrive in luxury stores next summer, as the designer has gotten such a big impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this is continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding exam results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further higher education, their chosen career and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an education sector able to develop and adopt a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and demanding subject within schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will come to the heart.”
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build trust relationships with people from other countries.
From the results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages got the most votes.
The data, collected by 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72% of students got the maximum vote with praise in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish got the maximum vote.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as essential skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages, as a choice of subject, are considered at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons that employees have indicated for the difficulty in covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have an effective advantage in the future with a lifelong competence like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to competition.
According to a survey by YouGov among over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to be able to maintain a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
That is why investing in language teaching is so important for today’s children.
Knowledge of multiple languages, particularly those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a valid employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK looking to 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with the teacher staff specialized in that area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary for success, whatever their future.
It is not possible to deny at this time, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative competences."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s pre-championship opening match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be set for how many minutes it will play.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers' six-game pre-championship program.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need friendly games to prepare,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia Gathering Moment, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia at a rally rally.
This is the first of five planned for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the pending confirmation vote for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump will seek to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress in the November election.
At what time will Trump’s commission be and how can you follow him online?
Trump’s committee in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump’s commission in West Virginia online through live streaming on YouTube.
Trump will likely talk about this week’s hearings of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense over allegations of sexual violence with a Senate early confirmation vote pending for a week as the FBI conducts the investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of committees is to help Republicans who have to face the November elections to get a little push.
So, President Trump’s campaign stated that these five gatherings over the next week are aimed at “giving energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so crucial to his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we progress into the campaign’s busiest season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Wheeling Arena, tonight’s committee could recall supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage of Pittsburgh’s media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is queued in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to push him into the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows courage to fight to keep hopes alive until singles on Sunday
After three one-way sessions, Saturday afternoon quartets could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The bike of the swinging pendulum is a totally invented sports concept in which players firmly believe and never as in races like these.
Where would the bike be now?
“They had a six-point advantage and now they’re four, so I’d say we’re keeping some bikes,” Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe is in favour, of course, four points ahead with another twelve at stake.
The Americans feel like they have a little wind in their favor, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to be hopeful about, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each one boasts three points out of four.
Spieth has been spied from tea to green and is setting the example.
The cheering guttural screams became stronger as the game continued, sinking a crucial putt to match the accounts in game four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His putt that made them win the game at 15 holes was greeted with a similar scream, which tells you that he believes the American team is not yet out of the race.
“You really have to put it all together to worry about your game,” Spieth said.
This is all that each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with more Spieth and Thomas points in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed version of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe is four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to pull a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth hole on Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the noisy crowd, reinforces the certainty that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to signal a possible European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, the speeches of European glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson soon made it to Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes have sunk the Spanish and the Swedish into a hole from which they have not been able to even far to climb up.
However, on Sunday there is no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between couples, the tips they give and don’t give and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained an important edge in the final day but this foursome session has shown that the U.S. team has the courage to fight, which some, in particular Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 advantage in the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid advantage in the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing Saturday's four-ball and four-game games with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired pair consisting of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods in difficulty to bring the score so far to Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, in an attempt to preserve the trophy lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning fourballs, winning 3-1.
The U.S. have resisted more in the foursomes, winning two games, but have failed to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points from Sunday’s 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they worked superbly to beat a downed Woods and the American-born Bryson Dechambeau with an even cleaner 5&4.
Woods, who drew for two games on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of genius but lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning four-balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson's side in the foursome to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three in the world rankings.
However, Europe did not get all the results hoped for in a pleasant and windy day south-west of Paris.
Three-time big winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a grueling 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fours, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has returned from a four-point loss passing to the singles, although as a title holder, Furyk’s team only needs a tie to defend the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, however, a Sunday counterattack seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea absolutely refuses to unilateral disarmament without confidence <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions was undermining the country’s distrust of the U.S., which under such circumstances would absolutely refuse to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the World Organization’s General Assembly that North Korea has taken “important goodwill measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see any consistent response from the US,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no security in our national security and under these circumstances we absolutely refuse to unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Although Ri has re-used the complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization with which North Korea would be rewarded on the basis of gradual actions, his statement was important because he did not reject unilateral denuclearization altogether as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri made reference to a joint statement released by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a U.S. president in office and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards "denuclearization of the North Korean security peninsula", while Trump spoke.
North Korea sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on the need to “have a denuclearization first” and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner and even oppose the “declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is an illusion of those who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of the sanctions is increasing our distrust.”
Ri did not refer to programs of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader had announced to the UN earlier this week.
On the other hand, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the counterpart of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be dead at this point.”
But even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different from that of last year’s speech at the UN General Assembly, when he said it was inevitable to target the U.S. territory with North Korea’s missiles after “the president of evil” Trump had called Kim a “missile man in a missile” impo.
In front of the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, paid tribute to Kim for his courage in embarking on the path of disarmament, but said that much still needs to be done and that sanctions will remain in place until North Korea denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a deadline, stating that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “respect for the Security Council’s sanctions must continue with force and without exception until full, final and assured denuclearization is achieved.”
The Security Council unanimously backed North Korea's 2006 sanctions in an attempt to smother funding for nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip has not gone well.
He left Pyongyang in July claiming that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of filing “gangster demands.”
North Korea had pledged during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the U.S. had adopted “compliant measures.”
He said Kim had explained to him that the “compliant measures” he wanted were security assurances that Trump had committed to Singapore and actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has pushed all of its students to sleep more in an effort to counter the growing male culture of studying for whole nights powered by caffeine.
A university scholar has found that students of the world’s number one university often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He had the idea of starting the course after a lecture he had given on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“In the end a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I told this only now, when I’m in my last year?’
She said that no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me a lot,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep-related habits can help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section there is the image of a bedroom, where students can select cups of coffee, tents, sneakers and books to be able to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by lack of sleep, and the importance of an evening routine.
In another section, participants are explained how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, therefore encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride linked to the “white night to study” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to lack of sleep being a growing problem.
Getting enough sleep and having good quality sleep should be the students’ “secret weapon” to combat stress, spousalism, anxiety, explained and even should serve to avoid getting fat because lack of sleep brings the brain into a state of inadequacy, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the Faculty of Chemical and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all graduate students to follow a similar study program before enrolling in this competitive institute.
Prof Czeisler advised students to set up an alarm clock for when they should go to bed, as well as for when they should wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can send in tilt the circadian rhythm to the door.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal beats Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another depressive attack from outside the home with Dolly Menga's goal relegating Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking for their first out-of-home win from the February 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 coaching games leaving his team eight points away from the Ladbrokes Premiership's running leaders.
Menga scored seven minutes before the interval and a short-inspiration Rangers formation never seemed able to match.
As the Ranger now drops to sixth, Livingston goes to third, and only behind the Hibernian for a goal difference.
And there could be further problems coming for the Rangers after the Calum Spence lineman was treated for a head injury due to an object apparently thrown from the outside of the house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly surpassed Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual formation that pulled a point at the Hearts last week and would be satisfied with the way his well-prepared team has smothered their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated by possession of the ball but Livingston has taken better advantage of the balls at his disposal.
They could have scored just two minutes later when Menga’s filtering pass first sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor’s door, but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
A penalty kick deep into Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his fellow defenseman Alan Lithgow could only pull side by side on the second pole.
The Rangers took control but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in a strict area.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he had to see himself assign a rigor at the end of the fifteenth as a result of a clash with Steven Lawless but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's demands.
The Rangers managed to shoot only twice in the first half but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not left to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and a soft shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston’s 34th-minute opening goal may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he deserved it even for his commitment.
Once again, the Rangers failed to manage a football placed deep in Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm in choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact given that the wing infiltrated a ball to Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw himself off the door line to block it.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors exactly in the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up one long ball after another.
Holt's team may have increased the detachment in the final stages, but McGregor opposed to stopping Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton filed a final request for rigor after a crossover with Jacobs but Thomson denied it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and the CONTEGGIO continues... the day the physical future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as the Geiger counter.
A staple of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," played by those unreliable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really feel the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "So it's just blowing up right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them.
Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their alteration in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein common to many types of cancer and are then reinjected.
An experimental test of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many types of cancer, called HER2, and so these cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein “promotes the growth of different types of cancer,” including that of the breast, ovaries, lungs and colon-right, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar procedure of extracting immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to affect cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West launches into a pro-Trump diatribe wearing a MAGA hat (Make America Great Again) after her appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was tapped into the studio during a Saturday Night Live bet after an inconclusive performance during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a MAGA hat, he began a smear campaign against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times I talk to white people and they say, ‘How you like Trump, he’s a racist!’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began the show with a scene starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star took Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Justice Committee against allegations of sexual violence filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's filipino was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock was trying to get around West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had spent a bad time in the backstage due to his cover.
“I was bullied in the backstage.
They told me, 'Don't go out with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And so they told me I was an outcast," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the submerged place?" and said, "I'd wear Superman's cloak because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Try the love.”
His comments generated whistleblowers at least twice from the audience and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with one person telling the newspaper: "A deadly silence has fallen on the studio."
West had been invited as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West has baffled many with a performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR KEEPING TASTE TO THE MASS."
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “what it is and this is just wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe is embracing a vociferous ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
And so it is with us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and is following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The friend of the rapper, Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion and of course the musical legend disappeared Prince, who had changed his name to a symbol and therefore the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder for stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is due to appear at the Belfast Pretoria on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Sword Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Throne of Spades.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the male hero's stereotype, stating that such on-screen soils often make boys believe they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed “something went wrong” and reflected on how to handle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the 31-year-old co-star of Throne of Spade, admitted to worrying a lot about this problem.
"I'm personally concerned, very much at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?" he said.
“What did we teach men as they grew up in terms of the problem we’re looking at now?”
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: ‘What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes boys think they have to be in this particular way of being human?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time – how can we change things?
Because, of course, something went wrong for the young people.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not play any prequel or sequel to Throne of Spades once the series ends next summer, stating that "he ended up with battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will play the lead role in Sam Shepard’s True West revival, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor has recently revealed that he considers the encounter with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with Throne of Spades.
“I met my wife during this series, so she gave me my future family, and my life from now on.”
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Jon Snow, the character of Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to health authorities sources.
About 40,000 new cases were reported as early as the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, according to Chinese health authorities during a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country’s traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are caused by inadequate protections during sexual intercourse within such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked the GOP senators’ data, and talks about “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
The U.S. House of Representatives on Saturday denounced allegations against a member of its staff regarding the publication of personal information from three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democratic MP said the statements were encouraged by opinioners and websites of the "ultra-right wing".
"Lies, lies and still hideous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information would include the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was released online Thursday, released by an anonymous Campidoglio during a hearing of a panel of experts on sexual violence charges against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and released information about a member of the Waters staff.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been put on trial as a result of these false and biased allegations, has not been in any way responsible for the leak of such information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ claim quickly generated online criticism from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This lie is furious," Fleischer wrote.
“This implies that he does not have the character to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
It doesn't have to be provocative.
He must not question the reasons of the accused.
You have to stay calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by the detractors of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate in the race to remove Waters in midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"It's huge if confirmed," he tweeted.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office has alerted "the competent authorities and law enforcement agencies of these tendentious claims.
“We will make sure that those responsible are exposed,” he continued, “and that they are responsible for all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff.”
Johnny English review still hits - the spy parody with an undersized Rowan Atkinson
It has become common now to look for references to Brexit in every new British-made film and this seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The Rebirth.
The self-irony curtain on how bad we do will be the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English from the rubber face and eyes out of orbit has obtained his license to encase things for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that is a comic creation developed for the countries of non-anglophone movie beneficiaries.
He is obviously the stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claims of glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a pinch of that kind who contributed with a single note to Gloria's theme moments of the London 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony.
It is a character based initially on the mysterious international traveler and man who once played Atkinson in Barclaycard’s now-forgotten television commercials, which left the chaos behind him.
There are one or two nice moments in this last Johnny English release.
I liked Johnny English approaching the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the propellers briefly swirl against his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift to physical comedy is obvious, but the humor seems rather undersized and strangely superfluous, particularly now that “serious” movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems direct to children rather than adults and for me Johnny English’s crazy misadventures are not as original and targeted as the gags of Atkinson’s silent films when he plays Mr Bean.
The premise of immutable topicality now is that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker infiltrated the supersecret Web of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the field, with the dismay of the agent in charge, a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that makes the jar overflow for a presumptuous and tormented prime minister, who is already suffering a string of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this like-Teresa May character but there’s not much to work on in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every single active spy has been compromised and that she will have to call someone who has already retired.
And this means that the evil Johnny English, who now works as a school principal at a chic factory, but who also teaches informal lessons on how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gags, when English offers a spying course like School of Rock.
English is picked up in Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with her former suffering partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a high society girl role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and Robin of Disasters for Her Majesty's Secret Services are back in action, to meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful fatal woman, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling into the network of the charismatic billionaire technology who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the left-wing Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they unleash hell by sneaking into the luxury yacht of Volta and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a virtual reality mask to take home halftime.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but as crisp and exuberant as it is, there is a lot of children's TV throughout history.
Everything is quite modest.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: couldn’t the British film industry assign Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to elaborate a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, despite being paid for five.
The party would like the main companies to transfer the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by offering them an extra day of rest.
That way employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, keeping the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The move to a four-day day was endorsed by the trade union congress as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior Labour member told The Sunday Times: “By the end of the year, a revision of the policy line is expected.”
“It won’t happen from day to day, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration in line with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for workers, as well as its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week as part of the 2017 general election campaign.
However, such aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week is not part of the party’s policy line and is not currently the subject of discussion.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economic field.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “faceless executives” and “speculators” in companies for public services.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also imply that current shareholders of water distribution companies may not recover their entire stock package, as the Labour government could implement “deductions” based on behavior considered illegal.
It also confirmed plans to put employees on the board of directors of companies and create inclusive participation funds, so as to transfer 10 percent of the net assets of private sector companies to employees, which end up pocketing annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises doubts as to whether or not the findings of the government agency may influence any of the Republican senators in providing support.
In an interview that will air on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to bring to light something that could induce them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said it as I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, which came out of that charge, I said, 'Did you do it?'
It has been resolved, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to be carved into the rock.
“I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could resist a bomb-proof accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett vigorously denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever she named couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything new in change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that sees the display of a remarkable star-studded carousel and has an equally remarkable mission: to end poverty in the world.
Reaching the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park’s Great Lawn not only to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also an awareness of the real purpose of the event, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert audience had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or any other significant way that would eliminate their awareness.
But, precisely, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival now that there are 12 years left to achieve the stated goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really a genuine way to persuade people to ask for an appeal to action, or is it just another example of so-called “cliktivism” people who really feel like making a difference by simply signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters, employed for a lot of different purposes.
It says these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, destined to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the first years of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements from their actions, of which they have already been disbursed or used as funds of at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that so far protected capital funds have had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and performers, committed to “helping children grow to the maximum of their potential,” with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after which the Global Twenties received more than 4.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make social injustice or malnutrition become a footnote in history,” said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman during a live concert in 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions were put in place calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the raising of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through interventions in favor.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, he asked, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and hard path – sometimes we frame and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of those who will perform at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy to implement "a block" and block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can, “if necessary,” use its Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russian involvement in Syria – in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern core of Europe,” he said.
And, according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with you.
“The United States has the ability, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, implement a naval blockade, so that their energy is not put on the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the convening of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same thing.
“The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to make a financial lever and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as “unusual”, with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made because the Trump administration has been involved in a mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, and to replace Russia, an option that for European consumers is by far the cheapest.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to pull itself out of Nord Stream 2, an "inappropriate" pipeline project that Trump said made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2, designed to double the capacity of the pre-existing one up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin object that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is driven simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a meeting held in September in Moscow for Unigrery with Rick.
The US position has triggered Germany's negative reaction, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has asked the United States to stay out of the EU’s energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I see as a big problem the fact that a third state interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take “serious consideration” of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take “serious consideration” of running for president following the midterm elections.
During a town assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed to contemplate the possibility of running for office.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and set up our rogue government, and that means having a woman at the top,” she said, according to The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will take seriously the possibility of running for president.”
During the town assembly Warren said his on President Donald Trump, stating that he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction."
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, by whom he was appointed to the Supreme Court.
Warren wrote in a tweet on Friday: “It’s natural that an FBI investigation is needed before the vote.”
A poll published Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run in 2020.
58 percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported such an application.
The poll garnered greater support for a bid by former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in support of a potential bid and 48 percent against.
Other names of high-profile Democrats discussed regarding a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump’s rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence case on Monday night.
“What’s going on with my son, what’s going on after I’m back, I can put it in relation to other families who experience the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the injuries our soldiers return with,” he told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "come back a little different, hardened, wondering if there is that respect for which their fellow soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have dedicated themselves to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interferes with a domestic violence relationship and gun ownership under drug dealers, according to Dan Bennett, a spokeswoman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge for new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the District of Columbia on Friday presented a curiae amicus memory in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged that policy, as reported by NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions appeal that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and her violent gang members" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
It was put in a state of lockdown in Texas.
Prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum-seekers in the United States, as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a decision made in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed asylum seekers without documents to flee from domestic violence.
On Friday, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, declared that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of particular circumstances and circumstances of the application, and a similar ban violates that principle,” says the amicus curiae.
Inside the memorial, prosecutors also objected that the policy that bans immigrant entry harms the U.S. economy, stating the clear probability that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labor".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer guarantee asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is accessible to those who leave the country of origin because of persecution or fears due to race, religion, nationality, belonging to certain social groups or for political opinion,” Sessions said on June 11, as part of the announcement of the policy line.
Asylum has never been designed to alleviate every problem -- even every serious problem -- that people have to deal with every day around the world.
Desperate attempts to recover in Palu as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly desperate.
“There’s a lot of tension,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her little child in an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"At every moment there is an ambulance carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes, reliving among themselves their frail personal effects, in an attempt to recover whatever they were able to find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, a victim of a shoulder and back fracture, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to the ongoing heavy build-up shocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he told the feeling of the violent earthquake that shook the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
“I was crushed among the rubble of the wall, I think,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to you and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘making Pre-Potentials’ with ‘Advertising Propaganda’
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad on a U.S. newspaper, advertising the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press for propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the announcement paid by the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the highest-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, a charge that China is resuming.
The accusation made by Trump, about the fact that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election, noted what U.S. officials reported to Reuters as a new phase of a Washington-led escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a escalating trade war that has seen them adjust their tariffs to their imports.
China’s reprisal duties at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, as Chinese and US experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, “now increases those prepotencies by publishing advertising on our free newspapers.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the roadshow here in Beijing you will find few dissenting voices and you will see no real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese population might have on China's problematic economic trajectory, given that the media are under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most distinguished newspapers has evaded the offer to publish" his article, although he did not state which newspaper it is.
Republicans are alienating the female electorate before the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
Since many top Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court and stand by his side in facing various charges of sexual harassment, analysts have said that a negative reaction, especially on the part of women, will be seen during the upcoming midterm elections.
The agitation in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown that they want to continue with a vote.
“These things cannot be withdrawn,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted that the last minute insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to placate angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it either tomorrow or in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, told Washington, D.C. on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate Hall, when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to continue with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
“Democrats’ enthusiasm and motivation are going to the stars,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say they were already high; it’s true.
But they could be higher, especially among undecided periphery electricians and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote despite not liking the president."
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which provided details of his allegations of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts had speculated that a negative reaction could have occurred if Republicans continued with the confirmation.
“For the GOP it has become a confusing whole,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the vote for the committee, the final one, or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it's also about how Republicans handled the situation and the way they handled it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elected members, said in a statement.
In any case, Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person they believe in following the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a smaller percentage in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believe Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the allegations brought forward by Ford, as well as at least one of the other defendants, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a state of Hebrew when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the Supreme Court candidate exposes her genitals during a party during her studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that draws its origins from Berners-Lee’s open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people will be able to access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the hidden intent behind Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data warehouse” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, things to do, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were all available on a single browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data warehouse is that it is entirely up to the user who can have access to what type of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to bring adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some staff developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers around the world will be able to bring their decentralized apps to life using the tools available on the Inrupt site.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not tell Facebook and Google whether or not to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely discarded from day to day.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid.”
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has represented an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the Church of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The Church of England’s only churchman to be rewarded with a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter was commemorated in his hometown after 100 years.
The lieutenant colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, gained recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had achieved the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren opened a commemorative plaque.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone would be inaugurated exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning prowess.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very dense fog, under the heavy fire of the camp and war machines".
Then he rushed towards the line of fire and with the "biggest gallantry" he advanced the line before running with a single-handed cannon and landing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never be up to and something that makes him more humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt really honored to play a role in the parade" and added "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to him by so many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they beat Peppa Pig
Imagine for a moment, you stayed up all night to watch the famous Bellator 206 only to then be denied the vision of the main event.
The program from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was to be broadcast in the UK overnight, live on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some have remained grounded after staying awake until the early hours of the morning especially for combat.
On Twitter, a fan described the move to the children’s cartoon as “a kind of bad-tasting joke.”
“The government regulation foresees that at six o’clock in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so we had to switch to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pepa the pig", "Yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said he will work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably find a solution,” Coker said.
"But there are six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for theirs.
But we're working.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of messages coming and no one was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to get so much for the fans, and we just discussed it.
It's an unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "lower" due to sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality – but this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he hadn’t realized until he got to high school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking in the first installment of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had made his voice heard about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that being a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The usual host of the old-time program, Kirsty Young, took a series of free months for illness.
Presenting himself as an outcast on Laverne’s first program, Daley stated that he felt “less than” anyone else as he grew up because “it was not socially acceptable that he liked both boys and girls.”
He said: “To this day, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, have been the things that really gave me the strength and energy to succeed.”
He wanted to try to be “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint anyone if they had accidentally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist became a high-profile LGBT activist and used his face at this year’s Australian Commonwealth Games to appeal to multiple countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said the fact that he fell in love with a man - the American director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 - "caught me by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When I spent so much at a young age" - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.
The two became parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If I had asked him last year, it was all about the fact that 'I had to win a gold medal,'" he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted being to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be on this side so you can be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I had not yet realized that it was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze medal.
“I only knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – swimming in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – Heather Small’s Proud – which had a special meaning for him in preparation for the Olympics and still makes him come sheepskin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's out-of-body form put on the bench in Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will score a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to get back in shape to prevent him from becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record twelfth time, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day between cheerleading and working on his own game in the range, hoping to correct what torments him.
Having never been the strongest driver even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the bumpy track regularly punishes the wrong shots.
And if the course itself wasn’t discouraging enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth match, faces the careful British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has collaborated with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of their 12 individual matches, start with a hot start, Mickelson’s match could turn out to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else.
“He fully understood the role he played today, gave me a pack on my shoulder, put an arm around me and said he’ll be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It’s a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably couldn’t imagine playing two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way it went and this is the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never even far mirrored the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brought intangible assets to the team.
“It’s fun, sarcastic, arguable, he likes to play with people, and he’s a fantastic guy to have in the meeting room,” he said.
"I also think the younger players have had a lot of fun circling against him this week, something that was fun to watch.
He did so much more than play.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can disappear soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable resort.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 meeting at Valderrama where the team, captained by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point lead by the Americans, reached the finish line with a minimal advantage, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I keep repeating that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but little,” Bjorn said after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday 5-3 and yesterday 10-6, at Le Golf National.
“So it’s going to be the story to prove to me and my team that it’s not over.
Tomorrow we have to give the maximum.
You have to go out there and do everything the right way.
It is not finished until the points are marked on the board.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that’s what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players on my team, but I know who’s on the other side: the best golfers in the world.”
Happy with the way his fans have raced in that tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have gotten over it.
Tomorrow’s is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is another thing.
It’s nice to be there with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re just your golfing skills are put to the test.
This is the message that needs to be conveyed to players: tomorrow, you have to pull out the best of you.
Then you forget about your partner because he has to go there and pull out the best of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, counterpart Jim Furyk will seek his players the best individual performance more than a team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who have collected three out of four points.
The same Furyk was found by both sides in those big meetings of the last day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before losing against the European "Miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every single word,” he commented in response to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players in the lead over the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to start right away with the right foot as we did at Brookline and Medinah.
When the game starts to take a certain bend, the pressure increases in the intermediate games.
So we organize our training accordingly and classify the boys in the way we think is appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do a magic.
Thomas was given the task of leading the counteroffensive and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the route to the end," Bjorn said of his selection for individual meetings.
Germany's new military ship has been delayed again
According to local media, the last frigate of the German military navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era military ships, but there will not be at least until next year due to faulty systems and an uptick in costs.
The Rheinland-Pfalz commission, the flagship of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates, was delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying post-delivery issues have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class ordered by the military navy in 2007 will replace the old ships of the Bremen class.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic markings.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years away from the national ports.
However, continued delays imply that the innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its overseas power, will become obsolete when they enter service, the Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F-125 frigate reported last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media noted a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that made the ship useless if used on a combat mission.
The shortcomings in the software were particularly important as the ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half of the staff of the oldest ships of the Bremen class.
In addition, it turned out that the ship weighs significantly too much, and this reduces its performance and limits the military Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project (including the training of the crew) is also becoming an important issue.
It seems that it has reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems involving the new frigates become of particular importance in the light of the recent alarms regarding the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the military Navy actually "lacks ships capable of being used".
The official said the issue has worsened considerably over time, as the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class were able to join the military navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research carried out in a Scottish Highlands estate aims to reveal how bats use the view to procure food.
It is hoped that the findings can shed light on the behavior of the only existing flying mammals and guide future protective activities.
The study of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and soprano, as well as brown ears and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
Analysis of sounds recorded by an expert will determine the frequency of bat calls and how each species behaves.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be produced to create a detailed picture on the scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results can reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how these are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as lawn creation, and how to best keep forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly in the last century.
Bats are at risk because of construction and development work that affects trespoli and destroys the habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a threat, as can mosquito paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
The bats are not really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than the eyes when it comes to grabbing a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles on their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
Ten qualified experts regularly conduct investigations, inspect trespolies, and sometimes perform rescues.
The organisation even established Scotland's first reserve for bats at the Threave estate in the Dumfries and Galloway region, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The owner of the estate, David Thompson, claims that the property is the ideal territory.
"Here at Threave we have a vast area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many centuries-old trees and a good habitat.
But there’s a lot about bats that we don’t yet know about, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about their growth needs.”
It underlines the importance of controlling bats before leading maintenance within the properties as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single mother trombone could kill up to 400 females and small ones, perhaps wiping out an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their trespils.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species we don’t know how their populations pass.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges as Lawmakers Cause German Weekly
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled rape charges against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to advertise” with his name.
Her lawyers are preparing to sue German weekly Der Spiegel, who has published the charges.
The Portuguese striker of Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel also announced Friday the charge of paying $375,000 to keep quiet about what happened.
In a video on Instagram directed at his 142 million followers, in the hours following the charges, Ronaldo, 33, has snuck the statements as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false,” says the five-time Golden Ball aimed at the camera.
“They want to advertise themselves through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by making my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything's fine," added the player, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel on the charges, which he called “an unacceptable report of suspicions on the private sphere.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer will seek compensation for “moral damage to the extent of the seriousness of the privacy violation, considered probably one of the most serious of personal rights in recent years.”
The event took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga would return to the player’s room, where he subjected him to anal violence, according to statements filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga argues that Ronaldo would have put himself on his knees after the incident by saying that he is for the "99 percent" a "good boy" disappointed by "one percent".
From the documents it turns out that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had a sexual relationship, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also said he had gone to the police and hospital, where his injuries were photographed, but later agreed to a conciliation agreement as he felt "terrorized by retaliation" and concerned about the prospect of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old is now seeking to overturn the agreement, claiming she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the event, and this summer he will join Italian Juventus with a contract worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: the UK will regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
The UK “may regret forever” the loss of its status as a world leader in car-building following Brexit, Industry Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "concerned" about Toyota UK's statements to the BBC about Britain's possible exit from the EU without a deal and the resulting temporary production block at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Minister Clark.
The Japanese automaker claims that delays at the border, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, could affect jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I think that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO in Burnaston.
There is growing concern among other UK automakers about leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that after Brexit it will close its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain encountered by the manufacturers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is managed on the basis of the “just in time” concept, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and European suppliers for custom cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be border inconveniences that would cause delays and a lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than one day of inventory value at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would be halted.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid these border inconveniences.”
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow us to enjoy not only the current success but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other automakers, is that we absolutely have to be able to continue what has been a very successful distribution chain.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop but, in the long run, warns that additional costs could reduce plant competitiveness and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the plant’s union delegates, says workers are deeply concerned: “Based on my experience, once jobs are reduced, they are no longer reintegrated.”
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could still be postponed, the White House says.
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “rescheduled for a week” as the dispute over Judge Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller who investigates Russian interference in elections, the links between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and any obstruction of justice on the part of the president.
The possibility that Trump could fire the deputy justice minister, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, fueled the Washington gossip for months.
During the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a shirt to record conversations with Trump and try to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and it was rumored that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Wednesday, which was at the time at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid an overlapping with the Senate Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week of FBI filings against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate’s final vote.
On Sunday, Trump’s spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "It has not been set a date, it could be this week, I guess it will be another week considering everything that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I will continue to update the press.”
Some journalists might dispute this statement: Sanders has not been holding a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
The driver Chris Wallace asked the reason.
Sanders said the shortage of briefings was not due to an aversion to television journalists "who put themselves on display," although he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they put themselves on display."
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press could be more frequent.
“The president holds more questions and answers than any president before him,” he said, adding without citing the evidence: “We checked the numbers.”
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do that, as in the past few weeks, and this will replace the briefings with the press and you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown the reason, making a free-wheeling speech, and at the same time bizarre, in front of a group of journalists.
Health Minister Writes to Scottish NHS European Workers to Express Concerns About Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months in advance of the UK's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to deal with the costs of settled status (settled status) requests for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: “Throughout the summer there have been ongoing negotiations between the UK and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British government has also prepared itself in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate today my appreciation for the contribution made by all members of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and not only, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and communities to whom we offer a service.
“Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly wish you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie was operated on as a result of a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie has been subjected to an emergency surgery after reporting a head injury in Saturday's game against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost 31 to 27, as reported by Mike Organ of The Ten newspaper.
Technical Officer Rod Reed told reporters that the accident that caused the injury occurred just before the interval.
“He approached the boarding camp and he fainted,” Reed said.
First-aid staff and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on board the camp, before putting it in a barrel and taking it away for further investigation.
A Tennessee State executive told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that “we don’t yet have news of the type and extent of the damage” and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it was injured.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had made a total of five touchdowns before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 touchdowns.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bubble taxes for the purchase of property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bubble taxes for the purchase of property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Labour Party.
The maneuver will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters
The increase in the bubble tax will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury Department plans to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bubble taxes for the purchase of property in the UK and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The maneuver will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s initiative to attract young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and higher incomes.
The increase in the bubble tax will be applied to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional resources will be in support of the government’s initiative to combat the homeless phenomenon.
The surplus, which is added to the current bubble tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and on buy-to-let properties (purchased to be rented), could amount to more than 3%.
The Treasury Department expects the maneuver to collect up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, making it difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the real estate market.
Many of the country’s wealthiest areas, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the state.
The new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut on the bubble tax to help younger people buy the first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by seizing land without using them and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up on affordable housing quotas to fix the UK’s “unfortunate real estate.”
Mr Corbyn has announced an exciting series of proposals to reform the housing market, including checks on rents and the elimination of discharges without fault.
He also wants to give the council more power over the construction of new properties.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said that I would be committed to re-establishing the British dream, that is, that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be fair if buying a home was as easy for people who do not reside in the UK and for foreign companies as it is for resident British workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a house has become too distant and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality.”
Jack Ross: "My greatest aspiration is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland Technical Director Jack Ross says his “maximum aspiration” is to become Scotland’s manager sooner or later.
The 42-year-old is drawn to the challenge of bringing up the Northeast team currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren during last season's Scottish Premiership.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I’ve been in series B and that’s all,” Ross told the BBC’s Sportsound programme.
I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it’s something I’ll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager.”
Ross' predecessors led by Sunderland were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he does not feel any anxiety in following up on such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The success for me right now is measured by the ability to bring the team back into the Premier League.”
“Given the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it belongs without a doubt to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I think I’ll only succeed if I can get the team back on track.”
Ross’s career as a manager dates back to three years ago, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as a substitute coach for the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa save himself from relegation to the third level and brought St. Mirren from the brink of relegation to the Championship title the following season.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable now than during his football career in the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical teams.
“It was probably a real turning point,” he recalls about the direction of the Alloa.
“I really thought the manager role was made for me, more than the player.
It seems strange because I worked well, earned a living and had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with weekly.
I still face them in terms of stress and work pressure but management seems good.
I’ve always wanted to lead and now I do, I feel much calmer than I’ve ever been in my life.”

The summer heat wave has brought more revenue to English pubs in difficulty and more concern to catering services.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw an increase in sales of 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant revenue dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s commercial consulting firm, put the data together and commented: “England’s continued sunshine and long stay at the World Cup made the month of July follow a path similar to that of June, when pubs were above 2.8 percent hardy, while the rest of the world’s population was more stubborn.
The collapse of 1.8 percent in the restaurant in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars in which you drink the most were the strongest, with a homogeneous increase higher than the drop in restaurants.
Even the pubs in which you eat have suffered the heat, although not excessively like the restaurateurs.
It seems that people just wanted to go out and drink something.
In pubs and bars run, beverage sales rose 6.6 per cent a month, while food consumption fell by three per cent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s recreational and receptive industry analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remains the main factor when it comes to selling in the retail market.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent per year will be particularly severe in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for restaurants and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we enjoyed in August will give us a necessary break.”
Global sales growth between pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a drop in brand roll-out.
The British sales monitoring company Coffer Peach Tracker for pubs, bars and restaurants brings together and analyzes performance data through 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the industry’s leading company.
One in five children own secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey reveals that one in five children, some as young as 11 years old, own secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “fake Instagram” pages
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted in the background.
20 percent of students said they had a "principal" account to show to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, create social media accounts that keep adults hidden.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Instagram accounts, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted in the background.
Twenty percent of students said they run a clean “principal” account to show their parents, while keeping one private.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site found a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
The research, from the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of private schools, highlighted that 40 percent of boys between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them admitted to holding private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teens are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be 'voice for athletes' on the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics board during the national general assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in lightweight athletics and President Ian Beattie has described the nomination as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a deep respect for the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that in Scotland athletics could take a huge advantage by bringing it to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I look forward to acting as an athlete voice and hope to be able to contribute and help drive the sport in Scotland."
The American woman, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medals, as well as currently an opinionist for the BBC, found herself unable to walk following a transient ischemic attack.
She wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time could tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was a exhausting job but I recovered completely, learned to walk again and today I move with agility!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
The advertising of a tiralate compares mothers and cows and shares the online opinion
A dairy company has divided opinion online with an ad that compares mothers who are nursing and cows who are being raised.
To mark the launch of what is termed the "world's first silent and wearable sleight-of-hand", consumer technology company Elvie launched an ad in the form of funny music videos to show the freedom to express themselves as mothers given by the new sleight-of-hand.
Four real moms dance in a cow barn on a track that includes songs like, “Yeah, I get milk but I don’t have a thing” and “If I didn’t notice it, these aren’t mommies but my tits.”
The chorus continues: "Throw it out, throw it out, feed the children, throw it out, throw it out, throw the milk to my lords."
However, advertising, published on the company’s Facebook page, caused controversy on the network.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked different reactions among viewers, many of whom claimed to highlight the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
"An unhappy decision is to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to stay pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them a few days after birth,” someone wrote.
Elvie pullover dress discreetly under a bra for moms
Someone else commented: "Understanding traumatic for both the mother and the little one.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a latte for moms who will continue to keep their children?”
Someone else added, “It’s really pointless advertising.”
Others have defended her and a woman has even admitted to finding the song "fun".
"I think it's a great idea.
If you're still breastfeeding, I'd like to have one.
When I was wearing the tie, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little irreverent, but it doesn’t move far away from reality.
This is a great product,” someone wrote.
Another person commented: “It’s a fun advertisement dedicated to moms who use slats (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like ‘mucks.’”
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the domestic industry.”
In the end, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet sledgehammer embedded in the bra.
The concept to which the campaign is inspired is based on the idea that many women who use the sledgehammer feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pulley is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be threaded into a breastfeeding pad giving women the freedom to move, hold the children in their arms and even go out while they are pulling the milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: “The Elvie tiralate is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing the women who use the tiralate to cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by demonstrating in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new tiralate is able to assure.”
This isn't the first time Elvie has made news.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children showed up on the walkway of designer Marta Jakubowski wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved into a tent near the Texas border.
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially even though the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policy line have made it more difficult for these children to be trusted.
Most of those who took them on board were mostly illegal immigrants who are now afraid to challenge the possibility of staying in the country by offering to carry out such a gesture.
The risk rose in June when federal authorities announced that digital fingerprints would be taken to potential trustees and other adult members of their families and that data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had offered to hire children on their own.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80% of the people who offer to hire children or belong to the families of these people are in the country illegally and most of them are criminal aliens.
We are therefore continuing to hunt down these people,” Albence said.
To try to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules so some of them will have to appear in court within a month of the stop, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to those working at the reception points.
Many will appear in videoconference rather than in person, to perpetuate their legal status at an immigration judge.
Those who will be deemed unfit to receive help will be expelled quickly.
The longer children stay in the care, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety and depression that cause violent anger attacks or escape attempts, according to those who work at reception points and the relationships that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position claim that the likelihood of this happening is even higher in a large structure like Tornillo's where, precisely because of its size, it is easier for children's distress signals to be ignored.
They add that moving children into the tent without giving them time to prepare emotionally or greet friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already facing.
Syria closes to US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return home even though the war has now reached its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign forces occupy Syrian soil illegally on the pretext of fighting terrorism and “will be treated accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately without putting any conditions," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where since 2011 there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
Damascus will continue to “fight this holy war until it has liberated all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and from “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and supporting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the field in this war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions are favorable to their return and accused "some Western countries" of "inciting unfounded fears" that push refugees to stay away from their homeland.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return,” he said.
“What should only be a humanitarian problem is politicized.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided for reconstruction in Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided an extensive attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "precise deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will target jihadists, including al-Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene a new committee of members of the government and the opposition to extend a draft constitution for post-war Syria and prepare the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the group's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump will be awarded a second term
Under this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers perhaps hope, his presidency should not end prematurely due to impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the most dramatic presidential final ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of spectator bending.
Since 2014, first-night percentages have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the first night, up significantly from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” program surpassed network percentages by reaching 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with the most important news.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because it’s not something to explain,” said Neal Baer, a showrunner for ABC’s “Designated Survivor” that tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a brilliant comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
You asked him why.
He said, “Because it makes me laugh.”
Chaos is a source of fun.
Of course, unlike any other television program, the plot of Washington’s events can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade judgment, whether immigrant families can reunite or not and the state of health of the global economy.
Quit following the news, however, is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes far beyond its duty of informed citizens to find themselves following for the sixth consecutive hour a group of experts who discuss the in-depth research of Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", the 15,000-dollar ostrich jacket by Paul Manafort ("a garment full of Washington's implicating commentary"
I, for example, will no longer be able to watch Super Mario without thinking about it.
“Part of the reason why it seems like a reality show is that every night there’s news,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of Pawn Stars, about the events of the actors and the daily developments of the plot of the show.
You can't miss an episode, otherwise stay back.
This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the north coast of Kauai and although it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was locked in the house watching MSNBC and meanwhile was recording CNN.
He failed to break away from TV, not as Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Judiciary Committee and facing the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: “I remember when we once did all those stupid programs and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.’
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

Inflow of external money in the race for the tightest midterm elections
It is no surprise that in the 17th district there is an influx of money due to the re-alignment of a congressional district that has made two members in office now running for the same place.
The recent redefinition of Pittsburg's suburban district brings Democratic Representative Conor Lamb to the stage, who won his seat in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that in the old districts the electoral colleges had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race to the 17th district sparked a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a measured victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district.
That place had been occupied by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district for 20 points.
Political opinion makers have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. thought to penalize El Salvador for supporting China, then changed their minds
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, a rather cordial meeting was held between Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the Trump Organization’s ruling group to leave.
State Department officials have decided to bring the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement released earlier this month.
But the decision to impose sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in aid from the Americans for drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on the granting of visas, would have been worrying for the country of Central America with a high percentage of unemployed and homicides.
After a series of internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September senior officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference, thus definitively renouncing any sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence was tasked with chairing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, demonstrating the importance that the administration attaches to this meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving further messages of retaliation or punishment from Washington.
Bolton’s White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak, anonymously, about internal decisions.
What they said was confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who wanted to keep the anonymity anyway.
Study the story
In the report it will publish, special counsel Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstruction of justice, which now seems to have enough evidence.
According to what is said, Mueller’s investigation intends to shed light on Trump’s possible collusion with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress passes to the Democrats, Trump should respond to these accusations in front of voters and perhaps a jury of his peers just as he prepares for a new candidacy.
The unknowns are many and I do not mean to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, as is not the fall of his counterparts in Europe.
On both shores of the Atlantic we will have to make choices that will determine how long the struggle might last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to stage a coup against Hitler if the Western powers stopped him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
On that occasion, we failed by letting ourselves escape the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
At the moment, Americans have to deal with them differently.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein’s position has been complicated since just this paper reported that last year he secretly suggested subjecting Trump to interceptions by questioning his ability to cover the role of president.
Rosenstein argues that the news published in The Times is not true.
“How will we react if the new FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or impartial or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And above all, in the midterm elections we will vote for a Congress that will ask Trump to answer for his actions?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will have to prepare itself to face a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think that we will do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the candles of the Sabbath with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, I can only be optimistic about the future.”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing match against Villarreal in Spain, would give them a great opportunity to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Even though midfielder Graham Dorrans played his first game of the season on the occasion of the 2-2 draw with Villarreal due to a knee injury, he believes that this result could allow the Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because Villarreal is a good team," said the thirty-year-old.
"We faced the game convinced to do well and we brought home a point.
Maybe we could have won in extremis but, all in all, the draw is a right result.
They were better in the first time, while in the second we played better.
As for Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last match, but I am sure that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not be disappointed.
Last year was definitely difficult because of my injuries and changes at the club level itself but now the feelings are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys have fun and the preparation goes well.
So we can forget about last season’s problems and think about the future.”
Women are concerned about the cost of long-term care
Although those who participated in the survey have clear ideas about the type of care they would like to receive, few have addressed the issue in the family.
About half of those interviewed by Nationwide say they have spoken to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% say they have spoken to their children.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of the insurance industry on Nationwide’s life, “people want to be a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t face this conversation.”
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to assist you if you don’t communicate for a while what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide together with him and your family where and how you want to receive assistance, because these factors can be decisive for costs.
Get involved with a financial advisor: he will be able to advise you how to pay the expenses you will have to face.
The choice of funding for long-term care can include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life insurance policy with ransom value to cover these expenses or continue to pay for insurance as long as you are able to do so.
Prepare all necessary documents to avoid legal battles upon your death.
Name a health care attorney so that a person you trust can supervise medical care and make sure that the professionals meet your needs in case you were unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of an attorney for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions in your place and make sure your accounts are paid in case you were unable to do so.
Don’t forget the details: imagine your elderly parent being taken to the hospital in an emergency.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you are always ready.
“It’s not just a matter of finances, but who are the doctors?” asks Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be prepared for any event.”
Man hit several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was hit several times with a compressed air rifle while curling up on foot after spending the evening outside.
The victim, a 40-year-old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit by a chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "casual action".
The victim did not see his attacker.
He is not in danger of life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died as a result of a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
The communications were interrupted and the rescuers were unable to get any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some essential data about Palu and Donggala in the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Central Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that extends for more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the Sulawesi island.
The regency, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the Central Sulawesi province and especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Another tsunami hit the western Donggala area in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone called the Pacific Fire Belt and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a massive earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, including more than half of Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern area of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that crashed off the southern coast killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
The victims were more than 1,100.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A minor earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh causing destruction and panic in people who remembered the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
In this case there were no tsunamis but more than 100 people died under the rubble.
2018: A strong earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charge
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report issued Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for obstructing the complaint and resisting arrest.
According to the report, when a acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he snatched her hand phone.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and his deposit was set at $500, according to KTUU.
According to the television network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "certainly innocent".
Palin is in danger of being charged with three first-degree crimes, i.e. up to a year's imprisonment and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a second-degree felony punishable with a day of detention and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently under review by the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, of obstructing the prosecution of the crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her with a punch to the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the period spent in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity grid and communications are not working and the victims’ budget is set to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck off Central Sulawesi which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
On social media they circulate videos that show the moment of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors seek extraordinary capital punishment for suspected terrorist attacks in NYC <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the author of the terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people: a rare penalty that since 1953 has never been committed for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rental van from Home Depot to rain on a bicycle track along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
Under conditions for the death penalty in New York’s southern district, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and equally “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily injuries.
According to the court document, both of these charges can lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury issued 22 indictments in charge of Saipov that included eight counts of murder associated with felony, typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "true planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov termed it "atrocious, cruel and depraved".
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfullo Habibullahevic Saipov caused damage, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Dami".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the southern district of New York prosecuted the last death penalty case.
The man on trial, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death sentence was last carried out in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husband and wife accused of conspiracy through espionage and indicted for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Rosenberg's spouses both died on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of regret in the days and months following the attack.
Police say he was proud of what he did in front of the investigators.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he decided to end the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
As far as the 22 charges are concerned, it has not been found guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" by the indictment's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt and conviction without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s group of defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Member of Parliament Tory says NIGEL FARAGE must conduct Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today vowed to "mobilize the people's army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of Theresa May’s party MPs suggested that he should deal with negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK’s Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone told Birmingham that the UK would “already be out of Europe” if Farage was the Brexit Secretary.
But the challenges that May faces to try to reconcile the positions of her deeply divided party have been highlighted by Tory’s favoring staying in Europe who participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The prime minister is trying to implement the Chequers Plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, those who want to stay in Europe and the European Union.
The allies insist on continuing the attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what May proposes and the "chaos".
At the committee of the organization Leave Means Leave held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to leave the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"By this time we would be already out of Europe," he said.
Member of Parliament Wellingborough added: “I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan.”
Explaining the reasons for his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be servile.
We want to be able to enforce our laws in our country.”
Bone rejected the opinion that public opinion would be changed by the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in Europe is completely false.”
Parliamentarian Tory Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also attended the hearing and told reporters: “I’m simply telling the prime minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the public in general, the opposition will not vote for it, and it does not enjoy the favors of our party and our activists who turn out on the streets to vote to allow us to be elected.
Let go of the Chequers Plan and start listening.”
In an incisive message for May, he added: “Prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises.”
At the committee, Farage said politicians should be able to "feel the pressure" if they intend to betray the decision made with the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them we will not allow it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the people’s army of this country that voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, independent and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists have pushed the Tory against the Brexit flags after the group’s formation this weekend.
The Labour Party angered the Conservatives for the security problems they had with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can install IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus agreement, for borders without borders and for borderless trade in Ireland,” he added.
It's all a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will think seriously about running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic Senator from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about her future during a town assembly in western Massachusetts.
Warren, often critical of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
The assumption that Trump could challenge in 2020 has been in the air for a long time.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in the form of a town assembly since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she wanted to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it is now that “women go to Washington to fix the government and this implies that a woman covers the highest office.”
Arrest for the murder of the LSU Sims player
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect for the murder of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m. on ETNews.
On Friday, he released a video of the murder asking for help identifying a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims reported a gunshot wound to the head that caused his death," Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, told 247Sports.
Wayde intervened to defend a friend and was struck by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene of the crime in possession of a weapon and that he had hit Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at the Parish Police Department in East Baton Rouge.
A junior player of nearly two meters raised in Baton Rouge, last season Sims played 32 matches, 10 of which were to be held with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after victory over Sebastian Vettel thanks to team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of teammate Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was immediately clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would condition the race heavily.
From the pole, Bottas starts well leaving Hamilton to defend against Vettel's attacks in the first two laps.
Vettel first stops at the boxes leaving Hamilton in the group’s tail traffic, a move that could be decisive.
The Mercedes stop the next lap by entering the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtakes it after some wheel-to-wheel actions in which the Ferrari driver tries to prevent him from passing inside, risking to finish out after a double move to defend himself in the third race.
Max Verstappen starts from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first lap he is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then drives the race for much of the race without stopping at the boxing for the rubber change and tries to finish quickly to overtake Kimi Raikkonen winning fourth place.
In the end, however, he has to make the pit stop in the 44th round and in the remaining 8 laps he is unable to increase the pace and overcome Raikkonen, which comes fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri has worked well all weekend and it was really nice to have me through.
The team has done an outstanding job of winning the first and second position,” Hamilton said.
A bad example of body language
In a committee held on Saturday, President Donald Trump surrounded Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence on not revealing the content of Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing of attempted rape of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
During a committee in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “machines, bad and liars.”
"What can happen and what is happening in the last few days in the Senate where people are angry, bully, bad, and lying," he said.
“When there are obvious signs that the news is being released and the officials say, ‘Oh no, it wasn’t me.
I could never do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal the news?
Remember his answer... did you reveal the contents of the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Wait a minute.
We revealed it... No, we didn’t,” she added, imitating the senator.
The letter in which Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was released in early September, but Feinstein denies that the indiscretion has been leaked from her office.
“I didn’t hide Ms. Ford’s allegations, but I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to reports from The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the information confidential and I did."
But his denial is not credible to the president, who during Saturday night's committee commented: "I'm telling you, this is just a bad example of body language.
Maybe he didn’t, but this is the worst example of body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the candidate in the Supreme Court, which has been accused of attempted sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
“They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the messiness, the badness. They don’t care who damages, who they have to pass over to take back power and control,” the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after Friday’s Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by winning the return race for 5-3 Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants immediately passed in favor of two goals on shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to the tie before Dwyer brought the Giants back in advantage.
Francois Bouchard scored the tie for the Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's men that Friday night in Belfast they had rebounded and won the match with the Dundee 2-1.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants have won the first three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the 3:35 minute on Kendall McFaull's assist, while Beauvillier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assist.
In what was initially quite animated, Sullivan brought the home team back into the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the match's assist to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer decreed the advantage for the Giants by scoring the second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team rematched and Bouchard regained the tie after a strategic maneuver at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action which brought the Dundee to the advantage for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and ruled his team's victory by scoring the fifth goal in the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games at this point, will play their next home game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight Controller Dies to Allow Hundreds of Passengers to Escape Earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after he died to allow a plane carrying hundreds of people to take off and rescue them.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared as a result of a severe earthquake that hit Sulawesi Island on Friday causing a tsunami.
Strong housing shocks continue to interest the area and many are trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save his life, twenty-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung remained in his place in the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu, which oscillated fearfully.
He wanted to make sure that the Batik Air 6321 flight, which was on the runway, was able to take off safely.
He then threw himself out of the control tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“For us it’s really sad news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims could reach the thousands and the national disaster countermeasures agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is set to rise because many bodies are still under the rubble and it was impossible to reach many others," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
High waves of up to 6 meters have devastated Palu, where a mass burial will be carried out on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance transports bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Minimarkets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army men: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation activities.
Are you ready?", according to CNN.
During the year, Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Air disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims there is a dispersal after the lagoon accident
The airline that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, after saying that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members had managed to save themselves, now claims that there is a missing person.
According to Air Niugini news, updated on Saturday afternoon, one passenger is missing from the call.
The airline confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
The local vessels allowed the other passengers and crew to be rescued after the accident occurred while the plane was attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
According to official sources, on Friday, seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline says six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and are all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact sequence of events is not yet clear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the plane crashed into the lagoon because it did not reach the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane overflew the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived at a very low altitude.
“Ed was really lucky,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, were able to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He added that flight attendants panicked and shouted and that he was slightly hit in the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working in the vicinity to set up a bridge provided relief using a rubber to transport people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that over the past two decades, 111 people have died in plane crashes on PNG-registered airlines, but none of them have involved Air Niugini.
Analyst rebuilds woman's night burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution’s evidence in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
She explained to the jury how she used her cell phone data to reconstruct the movements of the twenty-seven accused Quinton Tellis and the nineteen-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
According to reports from The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have recovered location data from several mobile phones showing that, contrary to what she claimed, Tellis was with the Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the period he claimed to have been with friend Michael Sanford, police spoke with Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that the day was not in town.
When the public ministry asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by stating that that night he was in Sanford's truck, the latter confirmed that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is the fact that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Cell phone data indicates that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"She's erased her from her life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final argument on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to go to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by putting positive messages into their tracks.
Bristol’s The High Breed group claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins when it spread political messages and denounced social problems.
Instead, they want to go back to the origins and make again a kind of conscious hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and Common have recently returned to prominence in the UK thanks to characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York dad cites a couple in court for firing her with a "racist" text
In New York City, a dad cited a couple in court for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text in which his mother complained that he was "another black".
The couple denies being racist by comparing the demand to a real “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed her disappointment when she found out that her new dad, Giselle Maurice, arrived for her first working day in 2016, was black.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing the mistake, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman "embarrassed" fired Ms. Maurice saying that she was not happy with their previous father, an African-American, and that she was expecting a Filipino.
He paid Mrs. Maurice for her work day and sent her home with a taxi.
Maurice cited the couple in court and, to be fired, asks for a beauty compensation of $350 per day for the six months of full-time work she was initially hired for, even without a contract.
“I want them to understand that they can’t behave like this,” he told the Post Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to the accusation of racism by stating that Maurice’s dismissal was the only thing to do because they feared they could not trust her after she was offended.
“My wife sent her a message saying something she didn’t mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“Would you entrust your children to a person you’ve been rude to, even if by mistake?
Your baby?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a real "extortion", Plasco stated that the wife has been giving birth for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
“You can’t be with a person like that.
It’s not a very nice behavior,” the financial adviser added.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion immediately denounced spouses on social media criticizing them harshly for their behavior and the logic followed.
A letter reveals that the editor of Paddington feared that readers would not appreciate a talking bear.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, comments the letter: “It is not easy to fall into the hands of those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It’s funny now that we know the great success Paddington has had.”
Claiming that his father, who worked as a cameraman at the BBC before writing the children’s book inspired by a toy bear, would not have reacted well to the rejection of his work, he adds that the 60th anniversary of the book’s publication was somewhat “sad” after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family" adds that his father was modestly proud of his success.
“He was a fairly quiet man, not a presumptuous person,” he says.
“But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved like when you had a son who achieved a goal: you’re proud of him even if he doesn’t deserve yours.
I think he interpreted Paddington's success this way.
Even if it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the merit to Paddington himself.”
I had to say goodbye on the phone to my daughter who was dying.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital in Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter wouldn’t have done it,” says Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then she called me to tell me that she was going to die in a few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the drugs that the doctors had given her to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly weakening.
She died a while ago and it was over.
I had to sit back and wait knowing this was all happening.
I could not complain, cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers unaware of what was happening to her.
“No one knew,” he says.
“All the time I’ve done nothing but cry with my head down.
It’s hard to explain, but while I was on the plane I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two women’s tickets to stop suicide on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide commit suicide to prevent others from making the same gesture.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attacked on a bridge in Wales tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call to receive support.
Davis’s son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and he killed himself at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she says.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said he was lighting up every room he entered.”
But before he died he left work because the depression had brought him “into a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after taking his own life.
Davis says, "I continue to fear a chain effect will occur."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can contact to talk to, even if it is a friend.
They don’t need to be isolated, they need to talk.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, has lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, not long after his mother's death.
“You never said you felt down or depressed,” she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that his attitude had changed.
Christmas day touched the bottom. When the children opened the presents, he avoided looking them in the eyes.”
He says his death was a huge trauma that they had to work out: "He lacerated the family.
He broke us up.
But we had to go ahead and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's Future Is Uncertain: FBI Begins Investigations
"I think if we could proceed as he has asked, that is, with a limited investigation in time and in scope, we could reach an agreement," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the commission was "losing the calm" due to the blockade of radical supporters.
Why does Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
There are only five weeks to go until the midterm elections on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to get a negative result, they will be severely weakened in their attempt to get the man they chose for the Supreme Court to be elected.
George W. Bush called the senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and thanks to him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has completed its report?
It will vote in the Senate, which is currently made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the odds and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of political refugees 'decreases' with Kim
A South Korean legislator says the number of North Koreans seeking political refuge in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, says the refugees were 1,127 last year against 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park explains that the main reasons are a stricter border control between North Korea and China and the higher tariffs asked by those who illegally drive these people out.
Pyongyang has not issued any public statements.
At the end of the day, the vast majority of North Korean refugees are offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to talk about the denuclearization negotiations that are in a standstill.
This is after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work together to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized U.S. sanctions for lack of development since then.
“Without confidence in the United States we cannot be sure of our national security and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will proceed to unilateral disarmament first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit for Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not typically fit to cover such a task.
Pelosi expressed this opinion Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman behaved the same way, they would have defined it hysterical," Pelosi said of the statement made Thursday by Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations of sexually molesting Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in a state of excitement, so much so that he could almost scream and with his throat tight from crying as he talked about his family and years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s Democrats who have called the charges against him an “absurd and coordinated smear campaign” organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi believes that Kavanaugh’s testimony proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has proved to be averted against the Democrats.
"I think he's self-excluded with his statements and the way he talked about Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when she was asked whether she would try to put Kavanaugh in charge if confirmed and whether Democrats should reach a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I think if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it’s not just not appropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he presides over now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because she is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh evaded questions about his intentions to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
Pelosi said, “You cannot send a hysterical person to the Supreme Court and claim that this decision is welcomed in a positive way.”
And women have to use it.
It is a just diatribe, months and years of anger attacks from which it cannot get out without crying.
“We cry when we get up,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, and you?"
And he went on, "It really helped me a woman who was a leader somewhere. She told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she had developed a technique for which when she was angry and started crying she said to the person she was talking to "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then it went on.
I thought his was a brilliant idea.”
Tears are tolerated as a manifestation of anger in part because they are fundamentally not understood.
One of the sharpest memories I have of a previous job in a predominantly male office goes back to when once I started crying for an access to anger. An older woman than me, a glacial manager from whom I had always been slightly terrified, took me for a nap and dragged me along the stairs.
"Never make you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy because they’re holding you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the Colorado Congress, collaborated with Gary Hart in his run for president.
In 1987, when a boat called Monkey Business discovered Hart’s extra-marital relationship that she had to give up racing, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why she should not have tried herself to run for president.
“It wasn’t really a well-thought-out decision,” he told me laughing about 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and definitely didn't need another one.
Someone called them "Whites and the Seven Dwarfs."
As the campaign was already in an advanced phase, Schroeder was late with fundraising and vowed she would not run if she hadn’t raised $2 million.
It was a lost cause in the beginning.
She found that some of the supporters who had given the men $1000 to her candidates would have given her only 250.
“Do you think I can get a discount?” he asked.
When he gave the speech to announce that he would not launch an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who supported him, disappointment at the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger for the sexual discrimination he was the victim of), he moved.
“It looked like I was in the throes of a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled thinking of the press reaction.
“Someone could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my stone.
Maybe "I cried a lot."
How the U.S.-China trade war could favor Beijing
The opening blows of the U.S.-China trade war have been fraught and while the battle is far from over, experts say a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump has already issued the first warning this year taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on items worth more than $200 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>175 billion). This means that taxes will be applied on half of Chinese goods.
Beijing has reacted each time with measures of the same type, recently applying tariffs from five to ten percent on 60 billion U.S. dollars of goods.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. strike on strike and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon march back.
Because Washington is resigning, it would have to yield to its demands, but publicly bending to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Experts still believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, trade war pressures with the U.S. can have a positive effect on China over the long term by decreasing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions for an economic collapse in both countries is in fact far more dangerous than it has been recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher studying Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by the more than seven years of war.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions are improving.
“Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
According to the United Nations estimate, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any aid subject to conditions or from those countries that supported the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Europe team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the USA team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team reached the 14.5 points that served to beat the United States.
USA champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw his tee shot into the water in the 16th hole of par 3 granting Francesco Molinari the victory.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his turns becoming one of the four players who have always made a 5-0-0 record since the tournament with the current formula was first played in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated with a score of 5&4 by Danish player Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, gave up 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sergio Garcia who played eight of them, has become the European player who has won the most in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points.
“I usually don’t cry but today I can’t help it.
It was a difficult year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I won the cup.
It’s a victory for the team and I’m happy to have made my contribution,” said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the witness to his compatriot John Ram who beat USA golf legend Tiger Woods with a score of 2&1 in Sunday's singles.
“If I think I’ve grown up watching his meetings, I’m really proud to have beaten Tiger Woods,” Rahm said.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now the count of his Ryder Cup matches amounts to 13 wins, 21 defeats and 3 draws.
A strange statistic if you think he is one of the greatest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, according to only Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team spent the weekend trying to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the Europa team.
We threw away this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players behaved very well.
I'll work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I'm fond of these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We put it all together.
They played better than us.”
