In my view, the literature programme was formed by the ladies of the Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century we preferred Danievsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote ballet, of course, from the point of view of the most ladies of the Balzac age.
And the psychology and torture of the heroes of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Adolescents are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were plush to depict a certain kind of them?
There are roses of such color and with such a structure of a butterfly, resembling a barhat, usually dark red, burgundy tones.
And the bright roses look different, the butterflies have just the atlas or silky glow.

Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
The model "Prestige Micropack": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different rigidity of the sides: the medium-hard surface is formed by latex coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft – plate of natural latex.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of the sleeper, preventing the appearance of the effect of "wave" or "gamaka".
Among the advantages of the model, it is necessary to distinguish the breathable materials.
The latex, perforated for airtightness, is well ventilated in a natural way, as is the coir of coconut.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the sleeping place is preserved.
There is also an extended warranty period on the mattress.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact the shelf life of the mattress is more.
Protection from dust and pollution is placed on a removable cover made of jacquard, supplied in the kit.
Buy an orthopedic pillow in pairs to the mattress – it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides – coconut serves as an anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

Andrey, you have been explained to me in a profitable way that there are pensioners working in schools, they will not work in a command line.
The teacher of computer science will also not be able to help, he has not been taught this, the school plays games in windows.
So there's no support.
I remember these tables and guests in the parents' house with horror.
The guests on the threshold, and on the plate still the boilers are burned, the mother glazed home floor.
Oh, my God, I don't have the strength to sit at the table.
And then I'm gonna throw another bowl, clean up the house.
A week before the holiday, you push the food, two days of fasting, the day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
They're fine, and the cake must be with them.
I haven't liked the holidays since, guys.
Even for my family, I cover the table to a minimum.
And I make them delicious, the oven is very often just like that.
Germany: The fourth coronavirus vaccine is inevitable <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with a new force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough for full protection.
The head of the Association of Doctors of General Practice Ulrich Weigeldt is convinced of this.
This is reported on Saturday, December 11th, by Die Welt.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be needed in the summer, at the latest in the fall," the expert said.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be carried out “in combination with the flu vaccination.”
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, an increased vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus "Omicron".
The new version is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with “Omicron” is three times higher than that of the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that at two doses of the vaccine, efficacy was significantly lower: “neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.”
“This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against micro-stack infection,” BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
Therefore, a third dose is required.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Zaltzberger, advocates a reduction in the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
What’s more, according to Salzburger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the micron variant of the coronavirus.
“The experience of Israel shows this very convincingly,” the expert stressed.
Wovler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family of Pontoon21<0xC2><0xAE>.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created taking into account the use for underwater fishing, and not just for catching squid.
These extracts are larger than those of close-range analogues, a particular weight, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of the use of these interesting magnets.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and durable plastic, creating additional shades of vibration with vertical and horizontal wires.
As a "winter sweep" when caught in a hangover Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a fairly aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is simple monotonous animation, i.e. the fan movement up and down almost without pause.
When planning a deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when catching in a limited space, crushed by underwater vegetation, crusts and other obstacles, for which it is possible to catch.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant in the winter hunting of a sledgehammer and a large sledgehammer, and especially in the middle of winter, when punctual and aggressive baiting is required.
Having reached the end of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns and returns to the original vertical.
No less successfully, Bet-A-Vib is also used for winter fishing pond trout.
To satisfy its whims, you can choose from two modifications: with or without a sound capsule (NS – NanoSound) or a sound capsule (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that the Bet-A-Vib game in suspension is able to irritate the passive jaw, not reacting even to the liver.
When catching up, Bet-A-Vib shows distance and accuracy.
This veiler is understandable and not capricious, well combined with wood and braided cords even large diameters.
To catch the catch catch of a sting, a squid, an eagle or a squid other than an evenly relevant and "step", sometimes with "swimming" at the bottom.
If you catch in cornered places, you can change the front triangle to the double, which will reduce the likelihood of traps.
Among the baits of its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in the work and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
With the same success, it can be used on both relatively small and rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya reported about 7 thousand Russian mercenaries.
In Libya, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company "Wagner".
This was announced on Sunday, December 12, by the President of the Supreme State Council of the Republic Khaled al-Misri.
"At present, there are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the Wagner CPC in Libya.
They also have airplanes.
They also rot the tranches in Sirte and Kufr.
They have 30 jet aircraft on the airbases of Gardabiy (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte) ", - said Anadolu Agency.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to capture" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintaining the presence
According to the publication’s interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to preserve its presence in North Africa and “located in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufra, the agency said in a statement.
The Russian authorities have officially denied that the "Vagner" CBC is using the Kremlin's support.
Where can there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner is believed to be operating in nine African countries - the CAR, Libya, the Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training of local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner’s subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of useful fossil and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies and military services to these countries,” the article said.
According to the media, the "wagners" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not included in the law enforcement agencies or in the register of juries, and its fighters are not included in the formal lists of personnel.
The company is under U.S. sanctions.
Earlier, the post-provisional 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
This decision is expected to be approved by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of State of Libya de facto is the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions with the dominant Islamists in it, TASS writes.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting for the elections of MPs and heads of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
“There are less than two weeks left before the election, and the chances of them going on are rapidly decreasing,” the report said.
Against this background, Libya’s Supreme Electoral Commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period, Sky News Arabia reported.
Foreign Policy in the Eyes of the Russians
38% of Russians see more success in the country’s foreign policy than failure, 29% believe that failure prevails.
"Examples of success - "in Syria have protected, restored peace there", "the North Stream 2 decision", "the whole world feared that the cool weapons", "the Crimea we abandoned".
The main failures - "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world", - said in the study of the Public Opinion Foundation.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paper business production – all government services have also become only digital
The Government of Dubai has reported a complete rejection of paper business production and a transition to digital technology.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the UAE news agency WAM.
"Today marked the beginning of a new phase of digitization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," said the Crown Prince of the Emirate, President of the Dubai Executive Council, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed.
Now internal and external document circulation in all state institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected everything without exception: health care, HRC, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures have also joined the Government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in cash equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said that electronic services will save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkey's production and exports of cars fell below 2020 levels
The production and export of Turkish cars declined sharply in November against the backdrop of the devaluation of the lira.
As a result, the industry’s 11-month results were worse than last year’s results, according to Bloomberg, referring to data from the Association of Automotive Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 cars were released from factories in Turkey, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were sent to export, which is more than 25% down on last year’s figure.
And if, according to the results of the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector of Turkey showed a positive momentum to last year, then according to the results of 11 months of 2021, the release of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year.
The reason for this fall was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira exchange rate, which in November was 29% cheaper compared to the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs have received a delay in credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov told about the situation of granting benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, reports the correspondent of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kazinform.
"According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the regulation and development of the financial market, in this year, pursuant to the order of the Head of State of April 1, 2021, the order of the President of the Agency of April 9, 2021 No. 127 "About the approval of the procedure for the payment of the fines" - the order of the order for payment of the fines.
He recalled that the procedure for the deferral of payments on loans provided for the provision by banks and organizations carrying out microfinance activities, the deferral of payments on loans issued before 1 April 2021 to entities of IAS, including IAS, in the period from 1 April 2021.
The delay period was 30 to 90 days at the choice of the subject of the MSB.
In the statement, the borrower could have specified a different time limit for the deferral of payments.
During the period of delay in relation to the borrower, the claim and claim work were suspended, notification of the need to repay the overdue debt, as well as the creditor's collection of commissions and other payments," - said the Prime Minister.

Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the strain "ocmiron"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the strain of coronavirus "ocmiron" can be dangerous.
The reason is to look for in the conditions of the birth of the virus.
Scientists believe that "ocmiron" was born in the body of an HIV-infected or immune-deficient person.
In other words, he did not encounter any resistance to immunity when mutating.
Because of this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike-whites, spikes, may be more than laid, their antibodies have not been cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate "ocmirone" more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that the body’s strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections when a 30-year-old dies, and the elderly 60-year-old in the form of a sneeze tolerates it.
The immune response is angry at the young man, he is completely inadequate: where one could only threaten with a finger, he beats, as if from a rifle on the robbers, - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, often you can only cope with symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - it is temperature, weakness, helplessness.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, firstness in the throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, by the end of the year, they can start vaccinating the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old.
Virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering of the MFTI Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from Covid.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active layer, as well as kindergarten pupils, - said "Moscow 24" Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering of the MFTI.

Immunologists have put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of covid
The authors studied the remaining fat tissue from bariatric surgery, and found that fat cells known as adipocyte can become infected with the coronavirus.
The immune cells located in the fatty tissue, macrophages, were also infected, and showed a strong inflammatory reaction at the same time.
The researchers also looked at the fat tissue of patients who died from Covid and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in the fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid the immune system’s response.
It is also known as SARS-CoV-2.
The biologist explained the causes of dementia.
Semen Golosheikin, a candidate for biological sciences, described the causes of dementia and told about the ways in which it was prevented in an interview with Sputnik Radio.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself in the gradual loss of cognitive functions - with time a person with difficulty is oriented even in a familiar environment.
Golosheykin noted that most often dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of such factors as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible,” he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a short-term lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," the biologist added.
In order to prevent the onset of the disease, the WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of fissure load, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.

Egypt Returns 30,000 Illegally Exported Artifacts from Egypt
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return some 30,000 artifacts that have been smuggled out of the country illegally.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat TV channel, the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel-Gaud.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has been able to return 29,300 artifacts.
Only this year, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were found in the Bible Museum in Washington, D.C.,” he said.
Abdel Gauad clarified that all smuggled items exported by means of contraband are registered in the archives.
Now, the department's staff is working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists “track auctions around the world and online sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon return, cultural values will be restored, and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was the discovery of an ancient skeleton of a man in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol with a request to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
On July 4, Christie's auction house held auctions, at which a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused Egypt's dissatisfaction.
The Egyptian side also claims that the subject of art was illegally exported in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Ammon, has been kept in a private collection and has not been on sale since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
Egypt has in recent years been actively seeking the repatriation of illegal immigrants from the country at different times of the monuments of antiquity.
According to authorities, 95% of the contraband ancients are the result of archaeological searches of "black diggers".
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) - are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazans) live in Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are joined only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees’ personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the US, the Swiss bank does not provide its employees with corporate communications devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunication operator.
Under the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank has the right to verify mobile devices in extreme cases – for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a client who was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote working mode, the bank wants to distribute this rule to all devices that have been used to solve working issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank’s management has set a deadline before which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new claim.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Essenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the poet's earthly being and his ego.
He is already out of any literary associations, he has become confused with imaginism, he is by himself, but he is known, in demand, sometimes strongly mocked by critics, even maliciously, but the reading audience is ready to wear it on his hands.
More than 60 poems were written in a year, many of them - real masterpieces, completed the cycle "Persian motifs", wrote the poem "Ann Snow", published 8 books, the collection "Russian Soviet".
And the main success - at the end of June 25 of the year, Gosizdat signed a contract with Esenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
No one of the modern Sergey Aleksandrovich poets has received such honor, he is the first!
In addition, this poured very good money - under the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles. per month, the engineer - 200).
The money was needed that year like never before.
Esenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter Sophie Tolstoy, had to arrange a family home, contain the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
Life seems to have settled, there is something to rejoice about, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark tones, as if a nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Essenin) materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don’t know where this pain came from.
Is the wind a conscience?
over the empty and inhospitable land,
As I grow up in September,
It's a brain alcohol.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin was very thin, looks bad, apparently ill.
More and more frequent snoring, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason, probably, not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - Sergey Aleksandrovich someone did, there are no reliable documents left.
Let’s say, referring to May 1923, when Esenin at the insistence of his fourth wife, the Americans Isedora Duncan corrected the health at a clinic under Paris by Professor Peter Hannushkin (Esenin will meet him again two years later, already in Moscow).
And here is the testimony of the poet's singing, the scandals on this ground, the reasons for the militia are enough - scattered over dozens of memorabilia.
Since the beginning of the 20th century, the poet’s terrible novel with a green snake has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin briefly settled with his friend, the sculptor Ivan Startsev.
Amazingly, but Esenin, with his very good income, never had his home either in Moscow or in Peter, he found himself in studios, in hotels or in acquaintances.
The starter recalls:
“I only came to stay the night, and in most cases in an indelible, drunk state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Esenin fell down on the stairwell...
Falling, he scratched his face and fluffed.
After a little bit of himself, he began to cough continuously, tossing the whole simple blood..."
Yes, and Esenin himself after the war in Europe and the United States (there was a dry law in the United States at the time, but Duncan accepted a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I didn't see anything there, except the cabarets and the streets.
I'm done, and I've stopped remembering people.
Well, and drank, of course...
And I drank because the toss was dirty.”

Mattress Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is a modern implementation of the budget model in the premium class line.
The base of the mattress is a block of independent double springs duet.
Inside a large spring, a softer spring of small size is inserted.
This allows you to evenly distribute the load on the mattress.
On both sides the mattress is complemented by a filler – artificial latex.
It is analogous to natural latex, but it is denser and less expensive.
The flexibility and elasticity of this material increases the comfortable effect of the mattress.
Artificial latex is hypoallergenic, it does not absorb moisture and dust.
The mattress will perfectly fit a pair with a big difference in weight (from 30 kilograms).
Due to the "smart" springs, there is no wave effect here, when a light partner climbs to the side of the heavy one.
A pleasant, soft to feel jaw made of practical jacquard Sense pierces with a layer of synapse.
The natural fabric does not accumulate static electricity.
It is possible to manufacture this model of mattress in a twisted version (vacuum roll-packing).
Now his son is almost 16, and he has long been not bothered by the desire to choke.
All energy is directed towards the choice of what it will earn for life.
He is much more responsible than I was when I was his age or my husband, who had occasional problems with the law before the wedding itself.
The father takes care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "foreign love."
Why did the girl cry on the exam when she hadn't failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't a school?
She'll have a tail.
Well, what's that?
It's too late.
Millions of students know this.

Poland's Foreign Ministry believes Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU
Poland's Foreign Ministry says Belarus uses migrants as "weapons"
Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland Pavel Yablonsky expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a “weapon” against the European Union and intends to return to such an “operation” next year.
In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, the deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the corresponding statement.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus were temporarily "stopped" by Lukashenko, but he is "actively looking for new ways".
The Polish official is also confident that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon "in many parts of the world".
According to the website kp.ru, the European Union has previously put into effect the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It involved 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they said they were ready to continue to expand restrictive measures against the republic “if the situation in the country does not improve”.
In response, Minsk introduced a food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by the Dog Hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man laugh
The world events of 2021 were dominated by barhat pyjamas.
Perhaps the first person to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
As early as September, at the premiere of the film "No time to die", he appeared in a barhat Malinov pajak and a traditional "bond" doll.
After his example was followed twice by Prince William, who first put on the award ceremony of The Earthshot Prize, which did not match the royal dress code of the green velvet jacket, and then chose a more classic version of the event in support of the Royal Charity.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was also tested by Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh "Golden Ball" in the barhat jacket Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same clothes.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for men's barhat jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, who entered the "Gazeta.Ru", they began to buy them 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a velvet silhouette, the main colors - dark-beige, burgundy, dark-blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models - from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively pajamas - sets of barhat suits they choose less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment of the bartenders this season are represented in almost all brands - both Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which was released on one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci" brand ambassador Jared Leto.
When choosing expensive branding jackets, you can be sure that the barhat is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of interlocking threads, a dense fabric with a curly outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but also, respectively, serve less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vahoshkin, warns that in the case of a barhat jacket, the main thing - not his model or fashion, but the appropriateness.
"Barhat requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a festive event," explains Vahoshkin. - It will also be suitable for those cases if the invitation specifies the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion, the compliance of which allows to make a choice in favor of a barefoot jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a barhat pyjamas, first of all, should get the right advanced cushion with a lot, - the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Beauty Brammel." - The owners of barhat pyjamas, usually belong to the cast of those people
They are simply invited to dedicated secular events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vahoshkin offers to combine a jacket from a barhat with the same outfits: classic pants with arrows, one-tone shirts, silk sleeves, lofers with brushes, buckles.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Fashion experts from "Beauty Brammel" are sure: it will be inappropriate to appear in the barhat jacket of a regular employee on the corporate, and if it is a "manager among those who fuel this event", then "yes", he has such a thing in mind.
If the employee rank is lower, and the purpose of it is the desire to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to beat out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
This guide will definitely appreciate the phrase "not on the Little Hat" - say the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very vague sensations from the voice.

It’s all about money – alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, paid.
Billions of investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy is also not in landfill – both gas, oil, and coal have been bought cheaper than they are now selling.
Demand for fuel is wild.
The bastard's sniffing.
Who is in flight then?
As usual, a regular buyer.

Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered as idiots who “slept” the energy crisis.

I didn’t see any beautiful people in the pictures.
It's just mediocrity within the average passenger population.
Perhaps, if such characters and confident in their beauty so much that they decide to show it to the whole wagon, then they will not sit on it, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautiful people", but certainly not because of their appearance.

The immunologist said that the revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of the coronavirus "micron "
Revaccination after four to five months can protect against the new strain of the coronavirus infection "micron".
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination six months later, given the appearance of a new strain, "a very large period."
“In previous strains, such a period was normal, but now it is best to conduct the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases - in four,” the expert said, calling for revaccination in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has had two vaccinations and a booster, or he has been over-sickened and vaccinated, or vaccinated and over-sickened, then he has received a 'hybrid immunity', that is, an antibody many and neutralizing enough," the expert said.
The "Big Seven" warned Russia about "large-scale consequences" in case of invasion of Ukraine
The countries of the “Big Seven” (UK, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) have published a statement following the meeting of the foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia’s “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have huge consequences and will cost a lot” to Moscow, but the concrete measures in the document are not described.
“We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia’s growing military power and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine,” the statement said.
Furthermore, the ministers call on Russia to “weaken the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations with regard to transparency of military activity,” which US President Biden said during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” the Foreign Ministers of the “Big Seven” also said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in return,” they warned.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome the restrained position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Trass, said that Russia would be subjected to “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, the meeting showed “a united voice of the seven countries, which account for 50% of the world’s GDP, and which have made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia.”
The Pfizer vaccine was found to be 32 times less effective than the Omicron strain.
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the micron strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
“We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the micron variety,” said Professor Malik Paris.
At the same time, the scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way of protecting against the severe course of the disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the micro-stack on it.
The authors of the study concluded that micro-stamming can cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality unless additional measures are taken.
The head of defense of Ukraine accused the German government of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Alexei Reznikov accused the government of the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking the acquisition of lethal weapons by Kiev within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month, Germany vetoed Ukraine’s purchase of anti-aircraft systems and rifles to defeat drones.
At the same time, it is noted that Berlin later softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as an immortal weapon.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with the allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on permitting the delivery of arms to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Andrei Melnik expressed the opinion that Kiev should not wait for Berlin to deliver weapons to Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the former leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons at risk of the development of military escalation of the conflict in Donbas, despite the "occupation by Russia" part of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will retain with the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that Kiev is expecting help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany “will be Ukraine’s partner in the technical sense,” the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the German Green Party Robert Habek visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

Revealed ways to return stolen through online money stores
There are several ways to return the money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with the RBC.
For example, to reduce the risk of major losses when entering bank card data into the hands of attackers, it is recommended to keep the basic funds on the card or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
Some of the savings can be deposited into a savings account and deducted as necessary.
Experts also recommend that you create a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use 3D Secure protection technology, you can run the refund procedure.
“As part of the rules established by the payment systems, on unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility is placed on the participant in the chain of calculations who does not use this service,” said a representative of Promsvyazbank.
An expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, Arthur Zaremba, stressed that the buyer has the right to apply to the bank for a fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be challenged and refunded.
It is noted that in some cases online stores themselves return funds to the customer if the order has not yet been sent to delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, director of the Safe Internet League Ekaterina Mizulina reported that in 2021 alone, 11 thousand appeals were received in different cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances can be to create a single window for complaints on online scammers.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany Olaf Scholz has arrived in Warsaw for negotiations on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the growth of Russian troops at the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "2 North".
Although Scholz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that he would call on Scholz to speak out against Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to transport Russian gas to Germany to bypass Ukraine.
According to Moravecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland’s efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
Poland’s judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for the disagreement.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice Party are in violation of EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its Supreme Court ruled that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, has not made public commitments to stop the work of Nord Stream 2 in case of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany about stopping the gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. Congress official said on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these messages, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine’s border, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the “Big Seven”.
Dmitri, take a closer look.

And I know these apartments very well and I can see how well they have been rescheduled.
Let them be all right.
It is always surprising when they write about the means to wash the sink, the toilet, the sidewalks, the cranes.
You do them once a year on Easter, don't you, that you have to wash straight.
Just don't let it get dirty.

The money found in the wall of the church will pay the plumber $20,000
Santechnik, who found the money in the church wall in the U.S. state of Texas, will pay the prize.
This is reported in the press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Austin is preaching, promising that religious Christians are waiting for wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cooley repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of packages with money and checks under thermal insulation.
He handed over the find to the church and, according to him, did not receive even gratitude from Austin.
“I wanted to hear him say, ‘You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you’ve done and what you could have done,” KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
Apparently, the find is related to a robbery that happened at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in cheques, which were stored in the church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, for information about the criminals, they announced an award of $ 25,000.
Justin Cooley could not claim this amount, as the duration of the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, in its time awarding five thousand dollars and later receiving another 20,000 dollars in a gift from the church of Lakewood, decided to reward the integrity of the plumbing.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police interrogated Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her words, her actions are her characteristic of "as a real man."
This is why the attitude towards her is so negative.
And it’s not that “she’s financially significantly richer than all the writers,” as they write here.

In Brazil, citizens are required to present a vaccination passport upon entry into the country
In Brazil, they were obliged to require the entry into the territory of the state of covid passport, the corresponding decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Robert Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from the presentation of the certificate of vaccination.
Also included in the list of exceptions are people who have come from countries where the absence of the vaccine has been proven.
“The situation is even more serious if you consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year’s Eve, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist traffic,” Barroso said.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities forced unvaccinated tourists from a coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
The scheme of full protection against COVID-19 has been revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed a scheme of full protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injecting and using a nasal vaccine.
With international use, a large amount of immunoglobulin A is formed. When the vaccine is given by injection, it does not occur.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate into the body.
And inside after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you inject both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But so far there is no decision on double vaccination,” the doctor said.
The chief prophylactologist of UrFO, the doctor of medical sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with the injection is the opportunity to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help in this case the protection of the body is supposed to be maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region, David Melik-Huseynov, said that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, it is this picture that is observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came before.
Inna, um...
I talked to a cobbler (died a long time ago) like this - if you're ready to change a warm house, a crib, a favor, a love and a play on a liquid bitch, then move on.
But the pessimist was trained and clever at all.
He chose my company and went home.
Video is a method that works in 90% of cases.
Not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I stopped many owners from running after the dog, even though they considered that there, 200 thousand run away (pomsky), took my hand straight and led it to the other side.
As a result, "200,000" was chosen by the owner, not the dog that ran somewhere there.
In Europe, mass protests against vaccinations do not stop
More than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets in the Austrian capital Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with restrictive measures and plans by the authorities to make vaccination against Covid mandatory.
From February of next year, uninvited people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
The Spanish, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held in their hands a poster that read, “This is a fake pandemic,” “I won’t get vaccinated.”
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, covid-certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, homes of the elderly and night entertainment establishments.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports by the authorities of a number of regions of the country has been made against the background of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand protesters protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then grew into a confrontation with the officers of the order.
A group of protesters began throwing stones at police officers.
In response, law enforcement officers used water softeners.
Nikolay S., even in Wikipedia there is no single opinion on this subject.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine", probably because she began studying earlier.

There is only one thing I agree with Zakharova: Americans carried only death and robbery to any country, wherever they appeared.

WHO has detected a micron in six dozen countries.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the new strain of the coronavirus "micron" has already been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported in the WHO report.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strains have already been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
It has only been active since the end of November.
The WHO is also concerned about the high rates of the spread of the new coronavirus variant.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain, according to preliminary data, could go around the extent of the spread of the “delta” strain, the same Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all countries absolutely without exception.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization, said that the micro- strain is able to have a significant impact on the progress of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar findings have been made in the UK as well.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that “micron” will push out “delta” in the coming months.
And the number of patients in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is at the same time that officially "micron" at the moment in the Kingdom is sick several hundred people, and according to estimates up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the “micron” strain, and more than 2,000 people will be taken to the hospital every day at the peak.
What the British healthcare system will be unable to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the strain "micron" is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
How the Russian "Sputnik V" reacts to the "micron" is not yet known - it will be clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamalei Center has just started testing the Russian vaccine on the strain "micron".

The Russians have warned about the new scheme of fraudsters
The attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video communications.
This is what Izvestia writes about with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon Product Director Zaura Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication means are dipfeikyki.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real records with the participation of the victim.
Thanks to this, the neurotic manages to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behavior of one person or another.
Abutalimov added that using a dipfeik, attackers can call a familiar victim on video or create a video with a copy of a person to send for blackmail.
“Such fakes can simply provoke bullying, as an underhanded perpetrator can put people in ridiculous, dangerous, or compromising pseudo-scenarios,” the expert said.
Leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case when it comes to technologies using video.

Here are five steps that will help you avoid diabetes mellitus.
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and vice.
Diabetes mellitus can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive activities play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - a decrease in the number of various drinks and the transition to ordinary water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods increase the level of sugar in the blood to a dangerous indicator when consumed in excess amounts.
Therefore, the first step on the way to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keep them at home.
The appearance of the disease is influenced not only by the wrong diet, but also by habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise to adhere to a low-carbohydrate diet.
Such a diet will not only help to lose weight, but will also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the appearance of a feeling of satiety, the secretion of digestive juices and increase the absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlov told about the "migrenia of the weekend" in the workers' day
A worsening of self-esteem over the weekend can lead to several factors
The reason for the deterioration of self-esteem after working weeks is often the "weekend migraine", said the famous doctor-endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior research officer of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of the University of Georgia, scientific director of the Department of Systemic Medicine of the Zouk.
According to her, especially often it is suffering from labor bullets, which on weekends are observed headache, breakage and weakness.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated in a week of fatigue, there are quite a lot of objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to change the conditions.
On the weekends, our lives change radically.
"We sleep for a long time, we lie on the couch all day, we probably eat more, and we drink less," the doctor argued. "Because of the lack of coffee begins a small break.
Because of overeating and lack of water - gravity and breakdown."
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction, which is called a jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a crucial role in the deterioration of self-esteem, Pavlov recommended to track what changes most strongly over the weekend.

South African scientists say low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against “micron”
South Africa announces low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against “micron”
Scientists from the South African Republic conducted a study and reported the low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against the micro-strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of the "micron") corresponds to (the level) the effectiveness of the vaccine in 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which is why ... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is questioned, - says the text of the study, published in the journal Medtak.
At the same time, experts specified that the drug can save from the severe course of the disease.
Earlier at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the micro-stamp of the coronavirus could trigger a new wave of pandemics in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much sugar is there in conventional foods?
Sugar is not the best source of useful nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under an unfamiliar word in the composition of the product can be indicated a hidden sugar - ingredient, similar to sugar on caloricity, composition and glycemic index.
On the label can be presented several dozen names, essentially indicating sugar.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other raw sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), melass (black stream), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and dissaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in a doctor’s flask, bread, etc.
As stated in Roscoe, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and to many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. originally contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany, as the country continues to transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
“In 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation in Germany and Europe will play a different role,” he said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to maintain its commitment to Ukraine’s transport of Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement, which recorded support from Berlin for Ukraine’s energy transformation.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbok said that the process of certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the Minister, within the framework of coalition negotiations and discussions of the coalition treaty, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline is not yet "compliant with" the EU's regulations.

Hackers break Twitter Prime Minister of India
The hackers hacked the Twitter account of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.
The attackers were able to post a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legitimate means of payment, as well as that the country had already purchased the cryptocurrency.
Modi’s office was asked to ignore new messages.
Representatives of the prime minister said that on Twitter they reacted quickly – access to the account was restored.
India’s prime minister’s country has already been hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, "for" the independence of New Caledonia from France, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted, while 96.49% (75,762) voted "against".
The figure was 43.90%, a total of more than 80,000 New Caledonians took part in the elections.
As France-Presse comments on these interim results, “the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt,” as independence advocates urged voters not to participate in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed it being held on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago prevented a full and "honest" election campaign.
Thus, this dissatisfaction paved the way for the third victory of supporters of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
The separatists said they did not recognize the results of the last vote and would challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, in the Palace of Elise, French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to deliver the results of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia’s independence has largely revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have expressed their support for the territory to remain in France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific."
"New Caledonia must remain French," said Eric Zemour, who has been quoted as saying repeatedly.
The same statement was made by a Republican candidate, Valery Peccress, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro, urging the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position, “because it is not his responsibility.”
However, the president added: “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia.”
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "the strong desire that the election of the Caledonians be the election of France".

In Turkey tested the world's first drone with a laser weapon
In Turkey, successful tests of the world's first drone with a laser weapon have been carried out.
BPLA "Eren" tested at a distance of 100 to 500 m, reports "MIR24".
The device is able to neutralize explosive objects at a distance by means of a laser.
The maximum flight height of the novelty reaches 3 thousand m.
After the relevant tests, the BPLA must come into the armed forces of the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy the explosive devices without attracting the sappers.
Turkey is among the six countries in the world that are capable of developing and producing their own drones.

WSJ readers criticized article on relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized Professor Christopher Hartwell’s article, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly bringing Ukraine to the victim of Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and has allowed a number of insulting remarks to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to “act as a united front against Russia.”
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
“There is quite a lot of false information in this article,” RIA Novosti quoted one of the readers as saying.
“Europe is not ours to ‘lose’ it, and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine," he said.

Ukraine will begin to produce jet drones of the new generation
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will start to create ANKA type unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
On December 11, the deputy adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian President Alexey Arestovich reported about this.
That is, they are able to act against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against a pilot's plane.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the hull and the like,” he quoted Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA apparatus, Arestovi<0xC4><0x87> said that it is about reactive, not porous BPLA.
According to him, it is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "by all characteristics".
The first batch of BPLA should be produced by the plant at the end of the next year, concluded Arrestovich.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Staff secreted data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile complexes during military operations of the combined forces in Donbas.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky announced that the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones began in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of the center in the Kiev region, which will conduct training of personnel, as well as testing and maintenance of the Turkish BLA Bayraktar.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader’s office called this memorandum a “big real step forward”.
At the airport, two lions escaped from the container.
Lions fled to Singapore's Changi airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions, who arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were headed.
One of the fleeing lions lay on the roof of the container.
The animals could not be protected from it because of the installed next to the protective net.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of the staff of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which knows all Singaporean zoos.
They dislodged lions with the help of drones with a tranquilizer and plan to deliver them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion ran away from the owner and walked the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal returned home voluntarily, people were not injured.
Experts warn of cancer threat due to vitamin B9
Research shows that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was announced by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not have folic acid deficiency are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, in particular, colorectal.
However, exceeding the required dose on the contrary contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
A professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, dietitian Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you deviate significantly from this figure in a larger or smaller way.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor’s recommendation, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid flakes with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, a nutrition consultant, Rachel Feyn, called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
As it, among other things, is contained in avocados, Feyn recommended that men after 50 years eat this fruit more often.
In the UK by April, about 75,000 people could die due to the micron strain.
British scientists predict that up to 75,000 people could die in England over the next five months due to the spread of the coronavirus micro-strain, if not tighten the winter restrictions.
This was reported by The Guardian with reference to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reported.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists, who are part of the scientific and advisory group on emergency situations at the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, at least 25,000 deaths will be recorded in the country due to the strain of microns, and 17 hospice.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will take more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be required to prevent the National Health Service from overcrowding if the micro-strain turns out to be more contagious than the delta variant, and the vaccines in place will not be able to eliminate the infections," said Dr. Barnass, a mathematician at the National Health Service.
The UK’s Health Safety Agency said: “If the rate of spread of the micro- strain remains at the current level, about 1 million cases of infection will be detected by the end of the year.”
By the middle of December, the strains of the micron could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, in the UK, 1898 cases of micro-stamp coronavirus infection have been detected, of which 633 have been detected in the last few days.
On 9 December, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter worldwide.
Construction of the superyacht this year and orders for the next year beat all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have a desire and money for a floating fortress for <0xC2><0xA3>50 million or more will not decrease.
However, they are becoming more and more.
25% more ships were ordered this year than in the previous year.
Brokers say there has been no such excitement on the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of land-based infections and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If previously all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and the negotiations are conducted by the mind.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are accepting orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if their yacht was ready at least a year or two earlier.
“People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of space travel, life on yachts or flights on their own planes causes irritation in society, as the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with all the rest of humanity.
Economists call on governments to take action and propose introducing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that with such money mobility, it will be extremely difficult to do so.
Meanwhile, it impresses only the number of ordered super-yachts, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a length of more than 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Recke is building a 183-meter-long REV Ocean yacht.
After landing, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht features a "moon pool", as well as a submarine designed to explore the sea depths.
On the existing super-yachts, it became common for helicopters, movie theaters under the open sky, and on some of them, as, for example, on the yacht of fighter McGregor - a platform for unicorns.Professor of economic anthropology of the American University of Ukrain, says Ukrain,
But it has a symbolic meaning, given that there are just over 2,000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of over-consumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times more than the footprint of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the largest pollutant on the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission track docked on his 162.5-metre-long Eclipse yacht.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to push the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
The owners of the superyacht don’t appeal to other people’s sympathy when they, like Australia’s richest woman, Gina Reinhard, who owns the mines on the continent, complain through YouTube that their giant ships have no room for gossip.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build a marina for vessels of more than 50 meters.
Determined a dangerous weekly dose of alcohol, leading to the development of bowel cancer
U.S. scientists have determined which amount of alcohol per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts concluded that drinking four or more servings of alcohol per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
The exact cause of the development of this type of oncology can not be determined by scientists, noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, more precisely, all dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
But they don’t even know how much the four-legged animals are actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to learn for sure how intelligence has developed in animals.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as human, a new study proves that the dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in the journal Sciencealert.
Dogs can’t play chess or write poems, they don’t mean anything in politics, economics and art, but they often manage to fool their masters.
Representatives of some species, experts believe, show the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but the statistical data for accurate conclusions is not yet enough.
Thus, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and by their ability to learn do not yield to a two-year-old child.

Ukraine prepares for U.S. and Russian trade
The United States and Russia will “trade” about Ukraine’s entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for the publication “Glavred”.
According to him, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations in the near future on the guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of U.S. leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "enter a place of convenience".
If you are offered something knowingly unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not be trading, but simply send the offerer.
And with regard to Ukraine, there is a trade,” the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
“The training is conducted in secret, quickly and immediately, they go to offensive actions, and they do not wait until the group discovers and deploys counter-action forces,” he said.
China stimulates the development of the rail transport industry
China’s advanced technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Exhibition of Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing held in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, China.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, said a representative of the company, Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into service earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure the increased reliability and performance of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of rail vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing “Chinese speed”.
In May of this year, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. merged with the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd. the first two-storey high-speed electric trains designed in China for export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November began the trial operation of the metro train, developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey.
The train will move along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul to the city’s airport.
The metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's manufacturing industry for rail transport equipment is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaoshan, Head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Trade/Commodity Committee.
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of China’s production of high-end equipment on the world market,” said Feng Yaoshan.
After more than 60 years of hard work, conducting a number of independent research and development, China has created a state-of-the-art system for the production of equipment for rail transport, with a full range of aids and with large-scale manufacturing activities.
According to Feng Yaosian, the country occupies the first place in terms of the level of electrification of railways and in terms of operating on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia
Semen Golosheikin, a candidate for biological sciences in an interview with Sputnik radio, listed early signs of dementia.
According to him, the signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive disorders, such as inability to concentrate, planning, and lowering the level of abstract thinking.
There is currently a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheikin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and atherosclerosis of the vessels of the brain are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways of treating dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, reducing the risk of developing dementia will help study foreign languages and active communication.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical exertion, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies, which require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking.
“There are recommendations for the use of various BADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still being discussed in the scientific community,” Golosheikin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical exertion, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking,” Golosheikin said.
Earlier, the UK-based dementia research charity said the disease is increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarm sign can be considered problems with vision, because of which the patient acquires difficulty in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia is called aphasia, a condition where a person can’t find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
A neurologist asked to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili is in need of psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical council set up by the Georgian ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading in his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character," the expert said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychonervous rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage the receipt of medical assistance after prison officials subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian policy quickly succeeded in abolishing the punishment and restoring itself to the former rights.

Protests against COVID passports have been held in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate have been held, Europa Press reported.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was about 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID-passports have become mandatory for walking to bars, restaurants, gyms, homes of the elderly and night entertainment establishments.
Many protesters came to the action without a mask.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment establishments and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in the city declared a medical dictatorship, and the vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million coronavirus cases have been detected since the beginning of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people.
The bill on a unified QR code system was introduced by the government in the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that the Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, public catering facilities and retail with a presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a transmitted disease, or a medical certificate from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for trips on trains and airplanes.

The Cruel Rise: How the Chinese Become Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people and help create international-level resorts in the country.
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports activities, which will allow President Xi Jinping to collect 1 trillion yuan, but also contribute to the economic development of the remote provinces.
The mountain resort of Taiwan in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming more and more popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, greening works are also carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task in the long run is to ensure a comfortable and interesting rest in the Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become permanent.
However, it is still a long way off.
Game consultant Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed to unrecognizable.
Every year, more and more Chinese people go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many years to create a mountaineering culture here, Downs said.
Many of the resorts are located in the agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still have to actively develop and create the infrastructure needed there for recreation.
The 70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Chunli, near the venue of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom of winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago from Beijing to Chunli, a high-speed railway ran, now none of the locals suffer without work.
More and more shops are opening in the country, selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes are opened the points of the pub with dishes of the national cuisine.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwan.
China aims to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become the leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment - to reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO said.
More than 500 million people in the world could be in extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed down the progress of humanity in terms of universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the International Day for the Comprehensive Health Services of WHO and the World Health Organization, two complementary reports were published on 12 December.
In them, they found that the pandemic led to disruptions in the provision of medical services, caused excessive tension in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the population’s coverage of immunizations has decreased, the mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have stressed that the pandemic has caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it has become harder for people to pay for treatment.”
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their pocket.”
In October, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the coronavirus pandemic had left more than 100 million people in poverty, with more than four billion people virtually without social support.

Reuters: Taiwan’s minister banned from broadcasting at the “Summit for Democracy” at the request of the White House
Taiwan’s digital technology minister Audrey Tan’s speech at the panel discussion during the U.S.-organized “Summit for Democracy” was translated into video-free mode, according to a video recording of the summit on YouTube.
The Reuters agency, citing sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was distinguished by a separate color from China, which considers the island its territory.
The map, which Ms. Tan showed, was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world by the degree of ensuring civil rights.
Taiwan has been designated as "free" by China, the People's Republic of China, Laos, and Vietnam as red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced with a screenshot, noting that the views of the participants in the discussion “do not necessarily express the position of the U.S. government.”
China was not invited to the “Summit for Democracy”.
Reuters sources note that the map, which the Taiwanese minister showed, could go against the “one China” policy that Washington is adhering to.
One of the agency’s sources said that after the demonstration of the map, the U.S. National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing him of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized “Summit for Democracy” took place from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" summit of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the editor-in-chief of the "New Newspaper" Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money earned through corruption would be devoted to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Federation Sovbez Yuri Averianov said that the summit carried "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charges".

The Foreign Ministry told about the "careful conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergey Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestiam evaluated the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long course of interaction led to regrettable conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not start yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, but in part, the prospect of improving relations is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion on the outcome of the long journey that we have both gone through with the current administration, both with Trump and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday,” the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the United States to impose on Russia approaches on a multitude of issues.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about prospects for improved relations and would not expect a change in Washington’s position.
He explained that, with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cyber security, progress is not observed.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that signals will be heard, and Americans will listen to arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
The virologist warned about the danger of vaccination with a nasal drug from COVID outside hospitals
People who are vaccinated with a COVID-19 nasal vaccine may be allergic and need medical help, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized in airports and shopping malls.
This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the RAN, laboratory of bionatechnology, microbiology and virology of the Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It’s easier to organize nasal vaccine vaccination points at airports and shopping malls, but I would do it in the first place only in medical institutions.
The fact is that the probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine exists, it is small, but it is desirable for a person to then sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs, which act literally in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," - said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in the use of the drug will be accumulated.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the vaccine is absorbed when the nose is stuck after injection.

Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries, which are imposing anti-Russian sanctions
Russian President Dmitry Peskov’s press secretary commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continuation of “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “invasion” on the territory of the country.
"It is impossible to impose some restrictions against Russia and not to experience the suffering itself," the Kremlin official said on the channel "Russia 1".
Peskov claims that it "understands everything in the world".
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the field of energy as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars against Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.

New Caledonians reject the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of the participants refused to leave France.
This was reported by the French TV channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% of the voters voted against independence.
They supported independence from France 3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the south of the Pacific Ocean.
The results of the 2.99% bulletins were cancelled.
The level of participation in the vote on this day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the sites.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to the calls of separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was held in the region.
Most of the inhabitants supported the discovery of the archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20 thousand kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its own possession.
About 270,000 people live on the archipelago, the territory granted a special administrative-territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration that allows the region to organize a vote on its independence twice, with a difference of two years.

WHO Predicts “Micron” Less Dangerous Than “Delta”
The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously considered that “micron” is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
However, there are data on the reduction in the effectiveness of vaccines in the new variant of COVID-19.
According to information on December 9, "micron" is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigen profile of the strain protein "micron" allow to suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("heavy disease" - ed.) may be less severe than in "delta", - said in the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of “micron” infection in the EU are occurring easily or unsymptomatically.
However, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster "delta".
In Russia, two cases of Omicron-stamming infection have been recorded.
They were “previously immunized,” the Center for the Name of the Gambia reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova stated that there is no reliable data yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine named four scenarios for Zelensky
Former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
According to him, the head of state may remain without the support of the West, and may also compromise on the Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told about this in a publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first option, which Denisenko called "the perfect storm", suggests that Ukraine will stop supporting key Western countries, reaching agreements on the future of the country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"At the same time, there is a reduction in prices for key goods that we traditionally export domestic protests and the power struggle with key FNGs (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.)," - added the ex-parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will take place in case of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this situation, the leadership of Ukraine can compromise on the Donbass, as a result of which it is possible to confront the inside of the country.
At the end of summer Zelensky’s position will be weakened, the probability of such a situation, according to the former nardepa, is up to 50-55%.
The third option of the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation of dissenters with the Zelensky groups of the population and the president, which is why it is likely to take control of the power bloc and implement "populist initiatives".
In the course of such a variant of the crisis Zelensky will begin "reformation of power," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is Zelensky's transformation into the "father of the nation".
This can lead to an event that will be a major shock to society.
“The event should be large enough to trigger a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine,” Denisenko said.
Such a variant of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technogenic disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, according to the ex-Deputy.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly denied any possibility of “attack” on Ukraine.
In Moscow, they noted that it is Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from a survey of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest rate since the election of his head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the case of the upcoming elections of the President of Ukraine for Zelensky would give their vote only 21.8%, while for the ex-president of the country Petro Poroshenko - 14.5%.
Of all the respondents, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Arrested for the action on the Red Square poet: "For quote Evtushenko give 10 days, here she is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, the 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenko was arrested for ten days.
The student was detained on Red Square with a poster on which was written the hashtag #poetvrossiibochempoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
Alexander was drafted a protocol on an administrative article on a repeat violation of the procedure for conducting a public action.
He was arrested for the first time on January 23 at Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, lost, to the decline of the culture of the common in Russia and also little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," - explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal in more detail the message of his message.
How did the police officers treat you when you were arrested this time and before?
What did you ask in the section, how did you comment on your action?
This time the employees were more correct, the detention was as polite as possible, as ridiculous as it might sound in some context of the word.
On Pushkinskaya took the OMON money and took it hard.
They asked me about the motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approving, then understanding.
With the exception of all four sides of the monkey, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was going for.
And if after the action under this hashtag you start writing your poems, at least a few people, I'm not shy these 10 days.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak only in the language of the Tumba-Umba tribe.
And in public and official events they speak in the language of the surrounding people, so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on 25 September 2001, or in their native language through a translator.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks wonderfully in Russian and nevertheless uses the help of a translator.
And at the official events, there is a stenography on the age of the author, and the stenographer is not obliged to know several languages.

The researchers told how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that contribute to improving blood circulation and lowering cholesterol levels.
The root fruit contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help to function in the body’s systems.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to the high content of the bile it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use it can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the most benefit of the root fruit, it is better to smoke or cook, rather than fry on oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, as could other high-glycemic products.
These are carbohydrate-containing foods that quickly break down into sugars such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper Kommersant warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in private farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment will only be able to replace imports.
Lostfilm, Lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex release
Candidates for the flight
In 2015, rights holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirated runet sites and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, Director General of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to a regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search release of both Yandex and Google, you can see pirated copies of Netflix’s series “Game of Calmar” and director’s “Tenderness” by Anna Melikyan – the original series of Russia’s largest video service ivi (entering the AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engines, you can see the animated novelty "Encanto", but, judging by the quality of the video, it is the so-called screen (shot in the movie theater a pirate copy of the film).
On Filmix, which can also be found through the search engines, is available the series "Univer. 10 years later" TV channel TNT (includes "Gazprom-media").

Mattress Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimeit.
The model is comfortable in that it has two different softness of the surface – high rigidity and slightly more medium.
The composition of the product includes only quality and premium fillers, which have proved themselves exclusively on the best side.
Spring: in the center of the model is installed a block of independent spring "micropack".
This means that the sleeping area has 2000 spirals, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point adjustment.
"Micropack" is the most high-frequency of all the variety of spring blocks "Dimax", so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered a premium.
Fillers: combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are installed at the top and bottom of the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has a latex, the other has a coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long carried the status of classic, because it transmits not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties to the mattress.
If the coir provides the correct support of the back, then the latex gives the surface adaptation under the human body.
Shell: The model is supplied in a plain knitted shell Aloe Vera.
At the customer's request, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping place is 170 kg.

Estonian scientists will look for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to look for signs of life in the atmosphere, the camera said on Sunday.
The goal of the five-year missions is to assess the suitability for life of the Venus clouds, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools for measuring the acidity and oxygen content in the Venus clouds.
So far, it has been assumed that the Venus cloud, the closest to the Earth, is too acidic to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a planet of Earth-like type.
During the third mission, a sample must come from Venus.
Suppose that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to Earth or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth,” said the head of the Estonian project team “Venus Life Finder” Michkel Pausal.

Metaverses will change the Russian business
The topic of metavselen became popular in the fall of this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event has become an important signal: the biggest player has confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
So, the business in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in the creation of its own metacells and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be viewed as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the tendency to create remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, because people are tired of sharing and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the business’s desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
With the third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of asset digitization, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money go digital.

The British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O’Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022, as he believes such attempts will turn into a failure.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and in the second place - inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the price increase on the goods is temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic it was clear that “the world of infinite generosity of central banks has already experienced itself” and it is time to return to relationships where interest rates with inflation will correlate with the expected growth rates of GDP.
O’Neill noted that, in the wake of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policies may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as increasing poverty levels and climate change, O’Neill summed up.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, head of the Global Investment Discovery Research Department, said that positive expectations for the dollar’s exchange rate for 2022 are maintained, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar’s exchange rate, Shulgin called the Fed’s monetary and credit policy, the dynamics of oil prices, and fears in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
She's forced to agree.

Russians gave auto dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, the Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics from the agency Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale - about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenue in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is leading.
In 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars in the amount of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than the year before.
Hyundai’s related Kia brand has an even more significant increase – more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
At the leading positions this brand and by increasing the weighted average price of the car - for a year at Hyundai it grew by almost 21%, up to 1.94 million rubles - the stronger dynamics of the ride was only at Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands have not increased significantly: according to the statistics of the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms Kia sold 9.4% more cars in the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Closes the three leaders on the volume of sales in monetary terms Japanese Toyota - on cars of this brand the Russians spent in 10 months 275.5 billion rubles, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese followed Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 267.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand grew both sales (by 37%) and the weighted average price of the car (by almost 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles).
“Mercedes-Benz is seeing a good increase in sales and a well-balanced price – more, for example, than BMW – from here and a greater increase in financial capacity,” said NAPI Director General Tatiana Arabaji.
“In terms of sales growth, fantastic indicators are showing Chinese brands, as well as significantly increased financial capacity this year.”
The Russian Lada on the dynamics of income growth shows average market indicators (plus 28%), on cars of this brand the Russians spent in 10 months 229.4 billion rubles.
At last year’s level of financial capacity, there are companies whose car sales in units fell in 2021: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
For 10 months, the Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of auto components and production disruptions, covering the entire world auto industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AutoVAZ" increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last increase (at 8-10 thousand <0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x83><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xB0><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xB2>.
Values for their products and other car manufacturers are regularly rewritten.
The volume of Russia’s automotive market in monetary terms will continue to increase – in addition to the shortage of cars, its contribution to this is made by inflation, as well as the desire of auto companies to play out past losses, experts believe.
In terms of car shortages, I think that many automakers have even been able to partially shift the cost of past periods to the consumer, which they could not put in the price of cars before,
says the analyst "VTB Capital" on the automotive industry Vladimir Bespalov. -
I believe that in financial terms, automakers are feeling very well right now, while maintaining a high margin of sales.”
The indirect indicator of this is the growth rates of the value of cars that are observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are rising faster than inflation, the expert said.
In the long run, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With the increase in the supply of opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow and in the coming year, even if the increase in the value of the car slows down, car manufacturers will be able to get their income at the expense of the volumes, notes the independent automotive consultant Sergey Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now seeking to make the most profit from each car sold, Burgazliev notes. -
The increase in the volume of production of machines is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is still heated by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the situation in the market, the cars proved to be a good object for investment - bought a car a year ago, even with a run, now it is possible to sell more expensive the original price, the expert says.
Biden spoke about U.S. military transfer to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending U.S. military troops to Ukraine in the event of Russia’s “invasion.”
The statement was made by U.S. President Joe Biden.
"There have never been such plans," the White House chief said, responding to a reporter's question about whether the U.S. had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to defend Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The U.S. leader also said that the possibility of the use of U.S. troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will move forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more U.S. and NATO troops to the eastern flank, the B9 - all those NATO countries in respect of which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intention of invading the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use by Kiev of drones supplied by Turkey, as well as the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".

If a scammer calls from such a number, such as an “I.V.D. employee” or other power structure, then it is most likely to fail to drop immediately, and to blacklist.
Because to confirm his lie about his involvement in the power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to fear and negotiate.
More useful recommendations are needed for the people.
