Black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of money to improve the highway system, many people are looking at its solution in a small black box, which fits neatly on your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by the motorist and communicates that information to the authorities, is today an old-fashioned system for financing major roads in the United States. It is the construction site of the Washington and State planning office for the reconstruction of the old system.
In general, exhausting work such as highway planning has also suddenly become the subject of deep debate and living alliances.
The miles you drive, and possibly the location details you drive - and then use this information to prepare a tax bill - are available to the government to gather support in favor of allowing the use of these black boxes. Libertarians have gone to the suburbs to collect support.
The tea party is a must.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned about raising various kinds of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether further action should be taken or not, many states are not waiting.
They are looking at how they can go into a system in which drivers pay for every mile they set out on the road in the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black box for the test drive, some of which are GPS monitoring.
This is a very important thing for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether we choose it or not," said Hasan Ikhrata, who is the executive director of the Southern California government's union, who is planning to start tracking every mile set by motorists in California by 2025.
There is going to be a change in the way we pay taxes.
There is technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's Highway Trust Fund has become almost dilapidated, which is financed by U.S. citizens from paying taxes on gas pumps.
The U.S. is no longer buying gas.
The car now runs more than a mile in a gallon of gas.
There has been no increase in federal taxes in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high price of gas, politicians also avoid raising a money in taxes.
Transport policy expert Lee Munikh at the University of Minnesota says, "Gas tax is not at all transportable."
His state has recently installed a tracking device in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "In the long run it will work as the most reasonable option."
Wongx calls it a mileage-based user fee.
It’s no surprise that this idea seems good to urban liberals, as it can be transformed into taxes to change the way cars drive, for example, which can help reduce jam and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
California's planners are eager for the system while they are developing strategies to meet the targets set out in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the president of the Home Transport Committee, Rep. Bill Schuster (A-PA) also considers the Black Box as the most viable long-term option.
Independent sellers in the Rejan Foundation are also in favour of payment per mile by the driver.
Adrian Moore, vice president of policy in Rejan, said, "It's not just doing what's going on in the dark."
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transport secretaries, who, in their 2011 report, had asked Congress to move towards per-mile payments.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90-million test project, which included 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of rural legislators, who were representing people who had to walk too many miles to go to work or to go to the city on a daily basis, the House leadership ended that proposal there.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
It has the most desirable Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest trials.
These drivers will soon pay the state a mileage fee instead of a gas tax.
Nevada has already completed the initial test. . . .
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Elinois is experimenting with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, which includes 17 state transport departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) with the Eastern Seaboard, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported in all places.
In Nevada, where just a short while ago the device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers, the drivers were very impatient to think that the government could monitor their every move.
Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and action-implementation linkages in the Nevada Department of Transportation, says "There was a major concern about Big Brother and other things of the same kind."
This is not something that people wanted.
As well as proceeding with the test, the ACLU of Nevada had warned on its website: "It will be fairly easy to convert this device into a full tracking device."
There is no need to develop a vast, unmanageable technology framework, which must necessarily be expanded to keep a record of coming-and-go every person's daily life.
Nevada is among the many states that are making every effort to get affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get details on how many miles a day the car is driving, but not where and what time it is running.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small California start-up called the Tru Mileage.
The firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers had to pay on the basis of their mileage.
But the device that it is testing was good for the highway planners, as it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the mode at the specified time interval.
"If you don't track people's speed and their location, they'll be more willing to adopt this approach," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive officer of Troy Miles.
There have been some big mistakes in these early programs in the state.
There are also very low-cost and low-interference ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are making the most of giving different options to drivers.
They can choose the device of G.P.S. with or without G.P.S.
Or again no device can choose not to take, but can choose to pay the fee determined on the basis of the average miles determined by the residents of the state.
Other places are hoping that this concept can be sold to concerned citizens by providing less and more facilities in the device instead of the device.
In New York City, transport officials are trying to develop such a taxing device to the city, which will also have the facility to pay parking meter fees, "Pay by your driver" will provide motor insurance, and real-time savings from other drivers
The city planning document mentioned, "Motor-drivers will be attracted to participation in it because of the benefits that come from it."
However, some transport planners are surprised that perhaps all the discussion on payment on the basis of mile is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that by increasing the Congress gas tax, the Diwali Highway Trust Fund can very easily deal with the problem.
An additional one-time or annual fee may also be imposed on hybrid or other car drivers, whose vehicles do not use too much gas to pay for their fair share.
Randy Rantscheler, Director of Law and Public Affairs of the Commission, said, "What is needed for her to have a complete surgery when she can work with aspirin?"
If we do that, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
According to the police, his death was due to drowning.
Alabatta, his friend has been arrested by the police on charges of concealing the goods of late.
The police have handed over the final report of the investigation into the death toll to the court.
On August 26, police recovered the body of Jahid Iqbal, a resident of Padshahi Bagh in the Jelm Sea.
Her family had accused her of murdering her friends because she had lost her mobile and other belongings.
In the report, the police said that the phone and sim of the deceased were examined and found that his phone was being used by a woman in Soura.
The woman said in an inquiry that the phone had been given to her by a relative Rouhal Gauhar.
Ruhal also lives in Padashi Garden and was a friend of late Jahid.
Rouhal was buried in Jalalam with Jahid on 25 August after prayer-a-jumma.
Jahid opened his clothes and put all the stuff on the edge, while Rouhall went the other way to drink cigarettes.
When he came back, Zahid was not there, he was only in clothes.
Rouhel searched for Zahid, but he did not find him.
On this he picked up his mobile phone, watch and other items and kept them for his own use.
He did not tell anyone that the victim was drowned.
The police told the court that the death of the victim was due to drowning and confirmed in the post-mortem.
Alabatta, Rouhal has been taken into custody under Section 404 for concealing the facts and the goods of the deceased.

Silvio Berlusconi, 77, former Prime Minister of Italy, has married a 28-year-old girl in a very clever way.
The announcement was made by his family friend, Marcel Polanco.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been prime minister three times, has married former TV anchor Francisca Pascal in his private chapel.
She met Baluscony in France when she was a teenage activist in the Forza Italia party.
This is where France, whose relationship was being told that his relationship with Balruskoni is merely shown.
A close friend of Berlusconi and Bunga-Bunga girl Marcel Polanco have revealed that she was also invited to this smart marriage.
This event took place three weeks ago.
When asked about what would happen if the two got married, he said in an Italian Radio 2 revelation that the two are already married.
It was not a public event.
The marriage took place in a private chapel located in the home of the former Prime Minister.
No one else can say anything.
However, she did not attend the wedding.
He sent his greetings to the newlyweds.
The couple got married about three weeks ago, on October 8 or 9.
About 8 months ago, a 28-year-old woman, a 50-year-old girl, joined Franceska Paskal.
To avoid the circus, Berlusconi had laid the groundwork for the loneliness behind this decision.
Even in the lower regions, the rain continued to stop between the sun's eye and michauli.
With this, the cold weather has started in the entire plaintiff.
The cold can be estimated from the fact that the minimum temperature in Srinagar has reached -0.8 degrees Celsius, below -0.2 degrees Celsius in Gulmarg and -1.8 degrees Celsius in Leh.
Leh was the coldest in the entire state.
On the other hand, Srinagar-Leh National Highway traffic, which is strategically important due to rain and snowfall, has been closed.
There has been heavy snowfall on the Jojila valley.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of this season in the mountainous regions of Kashmir.
Due to the activity of the Western Vikshobha, the cycle of rains began in the high mountain areas of the plaintiff and in the low areas, which continued until late evening.
The general public was also affected by the cold.
People stayed at home to avoid the cold weather.
In the meantime, electricity supply has also been suspended in many areas.
The maximum temperature of Srinagar's day was recorded at 13.7 degrees Celsius below the normal of four degrees Celsius.
The weather in Jammu has also been getting colder at night due to heavy rain and heavy rain.
The minimum temperature in Jammu was recorded at 16.6 and a maximum of 27.0 degrees Celsius.
According to the weather department, the impact of the western cyclone has been felt and will improve in the weather from Friday.
According to Sonam Lotts, director of the weather department in Srinagar, the weather is likely to be dry in the plaintiff from the first of November to the seventh of November.
Asaram, who was jailed on charges of sexual harassment, was once again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage filed by Asaram, he is being presented as a blood-drinking Dracula of the children, but the court has rejected his demand to stop the media coverage.
Chief Justice P Satsivam's bench denied ordering the media to stop reporting about Asaram, saying it had seen every word reported in the media and there was no reason for them to intervene in it.
How can we stop them when they are getting information from the police and other people?
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of showing increased-scaling news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They file a case against someone, but the bench was not affected by these pleas and refusing to intervene in the case, saying they had other options.
Even before this, the court has once again dismissed the demand for restraint on media coverage.
The department officials claim that this is the biggest TDS theft case so far.
The mall's group manager then cut off TDS and paid to the relevant financial institutions, but did not pay it in the government treasury.
In doing so, TDS's rupee was deposited with him.
The investigation team from Mumbai on October 17 had taken action together with the Jaipur investigation team on the matter.
In the same strict investigation it was found that this trader has cut TDS but did not deposit.
For this reason, the TDS team had started the Income Tax Survey action on this group on Thursday.
About 15 days before the threat of account seals, a search and survey was carried out on the group of this mall manager.
Angered by the move, this trader has made it clear to the officials of the Income Tax Department that they are not yet ready to pay the Income Tax Department the TDS rupee.
The Department of Income Tax is continuously targeting them and taking action.
The investigating authorities in the case have made it clear that the recovery will be carried out by sealing the account in case of non-payment.
With Diwali, the demand for sweets is increasing.
In view of this, the sales of reduced and counterfeit goods are increasing.
Sweets are also used to make chemicals that are shiny, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous to health.
The Department of Food and Drug Administration has launched an anti-counterfeiting campaign against fake maw and chemical sweeteners.
The department has seized 70,000 mawa and 5,000 candles from Quetta Colony, who came from Madhya Pradesh.
The demand for sweets in the market has also increased as well as the demand for sweets from Madhya Pradesh.
The information department was given to bring the Ghattia Mave from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
Nagpur is being raided by the transport garage in the state.
The department seized the mave, the price of which was said to be Rs 70,000.
The fear of action did not give anyone the right to the mavea.
The Department declassified the unclaimed (undeclared) property and destroyed it.
The department seized about 5,000 candles at the Jitendra Cathers in Quetta Colony.
A chemical called Sodium Hydrosulfite was used to keep the glow bright and stay for a long time.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
S. S. Deshmukh, the co-commissioner of the Department, said that the campaign to capture chemically-mixed sweets and sweets and fake juices will continue.
Over the next few days, this campaign and speeding up information has been provided by the Department.
The consumption of these sweets can also be contaminated.
The department asked the sweet businessmen to make good milk, sweets from butter.
The appeal to the people has been made by the Department to be cautious of fake sweets and mavees.
The 42-year-old senior leaders of the state-run Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) strongly protested at the airport.
It is noteworthy that Modi has come to visit Bihar for a visit to Sanavan, organised by the BJP.
The family of the people who were killed in the blasts in Patna has the courage to extend their condolences on behalf of the BJP.
It is noteworthy that a total of seven blasts occurred in Patna on October 27 during Narendra Modi's humiliating rally.
The Indian Mujahideen terrorists who were involved in the blasts were chanting Bhagada during the terror rally, so that more people were killed and the atmosphere of terror in the region.
The terrorists did not succeed, but six people were killed in the blasts.
The BJP has declared them all martyrs.
Asti-Kalsh, the party leader from his village, has been on a visit since Thursday.
On November 5, the bodies of all of them will be streamed together in Ganga in Patna.
It is part of the same journey that the consoling journey is organized.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
He will visit the village of the people who were killed in the blasts from 7 a.m. on Saturday to meet his family.
During this visit, they will also provide a cheque of Rs five-five to the families of the deceased.
The BJP has already announced its financial assistance to the country.
The Indian team, excited by the dramatic win in the last match, will have to seize the series with the win when M Chinnaswami will land in the seventh and final ODIs against Australia at the stadium on Saturday.
India had to win the Nagpur ODI to stay in the series after two ODIs were cancelled due to rain and his batsmen gave him a record win in the series, which equated the team to 2-2 in the series.
Team India has scored a goal of more than 350 runs twice in the series and will once again be in charge of passing the team's goal to the batsmen.
The Indian batting is at an extreme at this time and the big target is also proving to be bout in front of him.
While Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in strong form, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja will also have high hopes for the team.
As far as the question of opening up is concerned, Rohit and Shikhar have got a welcome pair that is making the work of the remaining batsmen easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had given Virat the opportunity to play without any pressure while making a great partnership in the opening.
In the third issue, Kohli is considered Sachin Tendulkar of the future by what Virat has performed so far.
But many cricketers have given him a better deal than Sachin.
Virat, who will be 25 years old next week, has set 17 ODI centuries, of which India has won in 16.
In pursuit of the goal, his average is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but these three could also be a loss for the highly dependent team.
Raina and Yuvraj were badly flopping in the last match.
Yuvraj has not even opened an account in two matches in the series.
In such a case, a good pair of 'lifeline' can work for them in Bangalore ODI.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially Captain George Bailey, have influenced everyone with their performance.
He is also demanding to go on to the Test team for the domestic Ashes series against England.
Australia have a good batsman up to the ninth number.
Apart from Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voggs and James Fockener have also batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch have not been able to leave any impact in the opening.
Michelle Johnson's shortfall in bowling can be a big blow to Australia.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly so far in the series, has been sent home to prepare for the Ashes series.
Dr Jitendra Singh, a member of the BJP National Executive and chief spokesperson, said that Pakistan is working on a new policy of infiltrating terrorists in the wake of this demonstration of peace.
Referring to a report by intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement here on Friday that Pakistan is pressing for a probe into the infiltration of nearly 2000-year-old terrorists prepared in its training camps.
There will never be peace on the border.
Pakistan has been even more bitter after the failure of separatists to destabilize the situation by inciting the people in Kashmir.
Referring to last year's visit to Pakistan by separatists, the BJP leader said ISI chief Lt Gen Jahir Ul Islam, Lashkar, Hizb Sargana Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahudin had expressed confidence that terrorism had been unleashed in 2014.
Pakistan is committed to delivering on this promise with seriousness.
Suicide bombings in Samba, Hiranagar, Sambhapur and other parts of the border are part of the strategy.
In such a situation, demanding the abolition of the privileges of the military in the state, the BJP leader said that doing such things until there is lasting peace in the state is also anti-people.
They have anti-national elements in mind.
He stressed that the leaders' army, the security forces' mental-depression statements should be stopped.
Snow-Den ready to "collaborate" with Germany on U.S. survey
Edward Snow-Den, the U.S. intelligence official, has announced that he is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence to parliament in Germany if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, respond to their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Stro Bell, met with Mr. Snow Dan in Russia on Wednesday, where he has been given shelter to talk about testimony in Germany.
In a letter presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, the MP said: "Although the results of my efforts are demonstrably positive, my government considers the parties to be inconsistencies as change, and does not provide any defences to the Gondagardi."
However, speaking the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Dan said that he believes that the support of the international community can appeal to the U.S. Government to reverse criminal charges against him.
The allegations filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include theft of secrets and government property.
Hans Peter Frederick, German Minister of the Interior, told Zeit online: "Mr. Snow Dan is ready to talk to the German authorities, we will have to find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure as the NSA has claimed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone has been ringing.
Thomas Operaman, MP who is the chairman of the Parliamentary Committee, oversees intelligence information. He said that if the witness had the opportunity to listen to Mr. Snow Dan "without having to completely destroy relations with the United States and put them at risk," etc.
Mr. Beale, a Green Party MP from Germany, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snow Dan on Twitter feed.
He said that two German journalists were on their way to Russia.
According to former NSA contractor counsel, if they left Russia, Snow Dan would not be able to return to Russia, Bell said.
If Snow Dan testified in Germany, he would be "safe" there who would need assurances, the MP said.
In his letter, Mr. Snow Dan said that he had to leave the house for "they had to face a constant campaign and a constant campaign."
However, he said that the world is happy and excited by the widespread reactions "to his work of political expression."
U.S. officials, including the U.S. - world citizens as well as senior officials, have estimated the secrecy of a responsible system of widespread surveillance of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with German authorities "when the problems of the human condition have been solved."
Frontier Airlines Carriage - Charges to be paid on Baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 to carry goods to passengers on its flight board - on-store.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging for $100 for a carry-on bag and it will charge $2 for coffee or soda, though its announcement said Wednesday that passengers can keep the entire box.
The new carry-on is for bags in overhead bins, so, the small bags under the seat will still be free of charge.
Frontier said that $25 will charge if paid in Advance, $100 will have to wait if the passengers wait to pay until they are at the gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said that $100 per cent of passengers have to get to take care of the cargo in the arrivals.
"We don't want to charge him," he said.
In 2008, the airline began charging for the first and second check bags.
Those who are trying to avoid passenger charges are filling as much as they can in the Carrie-on luggage that is stuck in the overhead box, which means there is often less space in this box.
There is a way to bring less for passengers on the charge board.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising new charges.
It has quickly become difficult for the most loyal customers about Frontier to find the place of overhead bins.
This does not have to be given to passengers who purchase tickets on their website of the airline.
This means that the next person on the line can be given $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger on the line at a front door can get a bag for free.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure that passengers know about the fee before getting the gate.
Frontier's new career - on-fee, won't start until the summer, although a date hasn't been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage charges and other charges, but the airline likes them.
They argue that baggage costs money to handle, and those who want passenger service should pay for it.
Many see the baggage fees on Wall Street as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Most of them don't even have a carry-on bag.
Spirit Airlines Inc. first started the Carrie-on fee three years ago, and partner discounter Allegiant Air later.
With such a fee, there is also Wizz Air of other airline Hungary, which says airline consultant J. Sorensen, and which tracks add-on fees.
He said Spirit's Carrie-on fee brings in $50 million in a year which was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former officer of Midwest Airlines, recently flew in Spirit and surprised passengers who had to face Carrie-on unusual bag fees at the gate.
"The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was easy," he said.
I was hoping to brush my teeth and look out at a battle gate.
"The plane was full and he said it went lickey-split."
Frontier is also tracking the $2 fee of Spirit's for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier is good for those who will take soda, or juice they can keep the whole box, and it will give free coffee only for once.
It will still give away water.
The U.S. Air Force briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but seven months after the passengers complained, they withdrew and followed suit after no other major airline had been there.
If Frontier's passengers don't buy directly from the airline, this Frontier's move to charge charges on Carrie-on is its fresh attempt to drive customers towards its own website.
Airline pays the online travel seller for such a $10 to $25 per sold ticket. . . .
That’s why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from those people instead of going through an online travel agency.
The border, however, has moved forward in this area.
In September, many often flew over half a mile away for those customers who had bought from these individuals from an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the mileage award to 25 per cent of the trip mile.
So, a 1000-mile Frontier Trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn a distance of 250 miles.
It's also that they allow you to choose your seat in advance when buying directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier’s Denver has a loyal base of customers in its home city, but its trade is shrinking and it’s losing money.
Revenue fell by 9 per cent and its flying capacity fell by about 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by the Corporate Parent Republican Airway Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to finance Frontier as part of the sale of the airline.
N.S.A. Accused of "internal Error" Instead of Hackers for Website Crashing
The Secret National Security Agency said on Friday that due to some technical downtime, our website had been shut down for a few hours, not because of hackers, as some people had claimed online.
The intelligence agency said in an emailed statement, "The NSA.gov wasn't in touch for several hours tonight, which was due to an internal error occurring during the pre-set update."
This problem will be solved tonight.
This claim is not true that it came about because of the obstruction, distributed denial of service [D.D.O.S.] attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA's website was closed for at least six hours, and the site is not yet accessible to some users.
A spokesperson for the NSA told ABC News that there was no "absolutely" consonance with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesperson said that no classified information is at risk.
At least one activist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the website of N.S.A. by D.O.S. attack.

Drop in profits of Bombardier as aircraft delivery, drop in orders
Canada's aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 per cent drop in net profit on Thursday, under pressure by order and delivery in its railway unit in the third quarter and on contract issues.
The Montreal-based Bombardier also did not offer an update on the issues that would be completed by releasing any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or the aircraft to go into commercial service from next September.
About one and a half months before the first flight of the test aircraft, it has only been flown three times, raising the question whether the test stage is on track or not.
The result fell below the forecast and the stock has been sent to more than 8 per cent for sliding in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, on Thursday reduced its rating for "field performance" from "death" to "field performance" stock is limited to the next one to two quarters.
"The tight aircraft delivery was mostly expected, we are obviously disappointed with the margin performance in transport," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for Bombardier CSeries as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are being announced in the coming months, there is no doubt that the market program will be cancelled.
Bombardier is hoping the airline family can now cut it off at the lower end of the market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and was flown for the first time in September after a month of delay.
Potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight test to validate the company's claims about fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as is the mid-to-late order for CSeries up to 177.
403 full order and commitment are available with operators of 15 customers and more.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boudoin was confident that Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target from the time the first jet was brought into commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was running according to schedule.
"The test aircraft had been on the ground for a long time compared to the forecast," Boudoin said in a conference call, adding that it was also determined during the interior of the ground test and software update aircraft.
Each manufacturer makes a schedule in a different way.
We have decided to make a first flight and have an update period and said what we have done.
That is why everything will be done through the flight program.
With the rest of the five test aircraft just a short while later, the company is expected to fill the flight in the coming weeks, the company said.
Still, analysts believe that customers can start operating a CSeries aircraft after their first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier has said that it has evaluated the Service In Entry (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of the flight test - albeit in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - confirms our idea that the service at the entrance will be pushed into Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million a year ago, or $8 cents per share, $172 million, or up to $9 cents per share.
The adjusted income per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues range from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion in marginal dowry.
According to analysts Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, it was expected to receive revenue of 10 cents per share and $4.56 billion.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said 45 aircraft were supercharged during the quarter, down from 57 a year ago
The clean order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on September 30, with no change from December 31.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the consumption of the following order and overall, the market situation was a disappointment," Boudoin said.
Aerospace revenue fell by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier said the world's largest train manufacturer, the division, had increased revenue by about 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Orders in the transport unit were being backlogs of $32.6 billion from about September 30, up from December 31.
The implementation issues were also affected in some major contracts in the margins of the Transport Department.
The new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter, the executive officials said.
Bombardier's shares, which included Google Inc's chief financial officer Patrick Pickett Board, also fell 8.5 percent below C$4.83 in mid-afternoon trading on Thursday.
Brazil's Amber SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
New research has revealed that we work with full honesty and dedication in the mornings.
They don't lie to anyone and don't think like stealing or cheating.
But in the evening our minds change and we start to set the ideal against the rule.
In this research of Harvard University and Utto's David Ackles School of Business, the researchers have given a number of interesting facts.
According to the researchers, we prefer moral values without the stress of working in the morning, but honesty declines due to fatigue or excessive pressure in the evening.
For this, the researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell that the point is more to the left or to the right.
The participants were told that if they gave the wrong answer instead of the right answer, they would be given the money.
In this experiment it was seen that between 8am to 12am the people who were used did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
While experimenting with people between 12 and 6 p.m., it was found that they deliberately misresponded their findings by holding on to power.
This led the researchers to prove that the dawn of money makes no difference to our honesty, but only in the evening do we stop paying attention to morality.
This research has been published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.
After the robbery, the attackers fled and fled the scene.

Mr. Bigg has been jailed by an Adidas advocate of cocaine who gives secret information about the police investigation.
42-year-old Basrat Detta informs notorious criminal Neil Scarborough
The lawyer felt that people might find out about his secret drug addiction.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court.
The defence chief counsel, who told Mr. Bigg about the main police investigation, because he was afraid people would learn about his secret drug addiction, has been jailed for three years.
After 42-year-old widower Detta had agreed due to her cocaine addiction, notorious criminal Neil Scarborough provided sensitive confidential information about the investigation of her nascent drug addiction activities.
This lawyer, who was nicknamed "Baish", and who was praised by the criminals as "top brief", was arrested from his home in 2011 after the police surveillance operation in Scarborough, which he had in the previous Narcotic Antiquities trial.
The officers had seen 32-year-old Scarborough holding three bags of cocaine in the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancaster, while he and his co-workers went out for a lo-society dinner.
After finding cocaine particles in the detta's hair, her buttons, and her credit card, the investigation found that detta was a "regular user" of Category A nascent drugs.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain illegal information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarborough and his associates.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at the time as part of the main investigation of the heroin and cocaine gang operating in Lankashier, Cumbria, Merceside, Burkeshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 others, who were sent to jail after being seized in excess of <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during several raids by the police, along with heroin and cocaine worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The 42-year-old Datta was informing the criminals, as he was afraid that people would not be informed about his cocaine addiction.
Datta, who worked in the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburnd, was found guilty today in two cases after he was found guilty of obstruction of justice in the Liverpool Crown Court after three weeks of trial in Liverpool Crown Court.
He admitted to having cocaine in the previous hearing.
The lawyer's bad time began when while investigating Scarborough, police learned that he had been in regular contact with Detta since February 2011 on the phone.
The two spies followed the suspect and saw him coming to the house of Datta and holding a fresh drug with more than 60 per cent purity below the lawyer's bean in the Black Golf Glove.
After taking the drug, Scarborough was in regular contact with Datta on the phone, who went out for dinner at the Blackhorn Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
When the lawyer arrived at the house, it was learned that there was a drug store there and there was a communication between them nine times.
It was heard in the court that he was found "regular user" of cocaine in the test when he found traces of category A nascent drug on detta's hair, buttons and credit cards.
Detta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said he was talking to the suspect dealer because he was his client and said his discussion was a matter of "legal privilege."
During his arrest, Datta tried to remove a lot of credit cards by removing his buttocks, but he was arrested, and a sample of his hair was taken.
In a police interview, he said he was running an office from his workplace as well as from his home, and his client was calling at his house for legal matters.
After being told by the main arrested persons what the spy knew about them, the court said in the hearing that Datta called the main people of the drug supply chain, some of whom she had previously submitted.
On behalf of the prosecution, Anne White said, "The criminal lawyer should be best known about not breaking the law."
Mr. Detta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal advocate on the grounds that he is very much associated with his specific client.
We're not talking about the general drug dealer's relationship, but about a dealer who's providing his lawyer with the drug.
Some of his conversations would certainly have been legitimate without any doubt, as he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his legal-client relationship's limits.
He obstructed as much as possible the investigation of the police so that they would be able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Detta was not respecting his profession, but insulting.
He made some very close contacts with certain clients, especially with Scarborough, and he allowed the agreement of his own independence.
Detta denied any wrongdoing and claimed, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to inform Mr. Scarborough, I do not wait for 15 hours, but I immediately do it.
But after the hearing, Superintendent of the Lankashair Police Lee Hallstead said: "Mr. Datta, at the time when he started receiving drugs from organized criminals, at the same time he converted himself from criminal lawyer to criminal."
Due to his cocaine addiction, he made excessive compromises and became much weaker towards the goals of the leading members of organized crime groups, who used him to get important information related to the police investigation.
Advocates should maintain the highest standard of honesty, and people should be filled with trust and confidence.
Mr. Detta has cheated with this belief and has tried to avoid his profession in vain.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lankashiar examined Mr. Datta, in which he was also found guilty of three incidents of holding cocaine and now obstructing the path of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing the criminals to court.
This case should serve as a warning to the criminals that no person is far from reaching the law.
We will take you out and present you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and bhang.
Thirty other members of the gang were sent to prison for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Datta gave a question and answer session about himself, in which he said that his fantastic job would be to become a lawyer for a client with a death penalty in the United States, to be a dinner guest of Mohammed Ali and to be an inspiration for his work.
Kenya's press has been attacked by the controversial media law
Challenging the bill as unconstitutional, the newspaper said: "This is a terrible place, and it is legitimate to ask what is to stop the removal of judiciary freedom by Parliament tomorrow?"
Capital Group - which is the CEO of the most prestigious independent radio station and news website Capital FM., the CEO of Capital Group, Cyrus Kamau, said: "This law is cruel and very punishable, and we do not do it.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is a part of the government itself" and said that imposing a ban on subject-matter and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to our talk, and we appeal to him to send back the MPs by rejecting this bill,"" he said."
According to The Star News, the new bill will provide the government with "hard control over the media", while The Standard said that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have "stripped hard" and has called the bill cruel.
The bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after being attacked by Islamic gunmen at the Westgate Shopping Mall in September.
Kenyan media had broadcast a security camera footage of the documents sent to the scene of the attack, in which they had shown them intentionally robbing the mall, causing the authorities to get angry with Kenyan media.
Police chief David Kimayo had sent a summons to two journalists and media workers for questioning, though the summons was withdrawn after being harassed by the media.
Under the new bill, 2 crore Kenyan Shillings and 10 lakh Kenyan Shillings may be fined to media companies and separate journalists and, in addition, to "removal from list" or not to be denied official press approval.
When the penalty is not paid, the Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the offender.
According to the Delhi Nation, "The vast majority of FM stations have a budget that is enough to shake the foundations."
It also said that these measures could have the devastating effect of what is described as Kenya's "living blogosphere."
By shutting down the media, politicians know that they can do their will.
Nation journalist Mutuma Mathew Kenyai writes, describing the media as the main source of control and balance in public life, "someone will never know."
He wrote, "When the rulers are left behind, they will lead the country back to the era of hunting and hoarding."
In the past, Kenyan legislators have faced the wrath of the people.
In May, he voted in favour of rejecting the deductions ordered by the National Pay Commission, and restored about 532,000 shillings per month, tax-free unpaid wages, which is considered to be one of the highest in the world.

The U.N. has set new targets to tackle poverty.
The United Nations is immediately embarking on a new set of goals, which will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to address global poverty.
To replace the M.D.D., which ended in 2015, the Australian politician played an important role just before the Transport Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, to advance the “Transportable Development Goals”.
They were included in the final format of the document, which will be supported by world leaders including Ms. Gilard during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that it was time to "rise up from national interests."
"I am very pleased that the Member States have agreed to start the process and take ownership of the country in order to establish the universal transport development goal," he said.
These SDGs will be based on our development under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and they will be an integral part of the development framework after 2015.
I will make every effort to implement the mandate given to me by our member countries to meet our long-term goals of MDG-based sustainable development goals based on the success of MDG.
The issue of Mozambican security concerns is growing as strong personalities clashing with each other.
With a statue of the Mozambican founder President Samora, who was swirling down on them, thousands gathered in central Maputo for a glimpse of peace in a rare public display.
"We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanessa de Susa, chief executive officer of an investment company.
Fearing about the future of his country, he changed his corporate dress from the print T-shirt "we demand security" in monopolies and he joined the crowd of the capital independence square on Thursday.
For two weeks, clashes between government troops and Ray Namo have been reported almost daily, more than 20 years after a peace deal.
Ray Namo was once a notorious rebel of the movement backed by the white-ruled Rhodesia and South Africa's color-difference government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe there is no possibility of returning to the country's full-blown struggle, but recent events have stagnated foreign investors and locals.
Debts are being high for the rapidly growing economy, and some of the companies including Rio Tinto, Brazil’s Wells, Eni could bring in more than $50bn of investment next year to explore the vast offshore gas reserves and coal reserves of the West.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the main political power since 1975, blames each other for Ray Namo's tension.
Re Namo says the government launched the latest fight by launching an attack on its members on October 17 in Sofa La province, a traditional Re Namo cave.
With the attacks on the former rebels and then on the rise, government forces attacked Renamo sites and told the Financial Times of trying to kill Afonso Dhaka Ma, group leader Fernando Majang, Ray Namo's spokesman.
The government blames Re Namo for the clash for triggering an attack on the soldiers.
President Armando Gibbuzan has urged the United States to ignore the concerns about instability.
Mr. Gibbuzan told AFP, the French news agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "hero" "whoever tries to prove to his troops that he can implement his own decision on the government."
Both Free Limo and Ray Namo insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Mejang was quoted as saying that Re Namo had cancelled the 1992 peace agreement but the issue of concern has since become a topic of concern.
He told FT that what the deal is not being honoured by Free Limo
Our vision is to come back for the agreement negotiations, but seriously," said Mr. Mejangne.
The last talks between the two sides did nothing special to ease the tension of a series of struggles this year.
"It's about the two big men (Jebuzan and Dhaka) fighting with them," said Yusuf Han, an interpreter and Mozambique expert at the University of London Open.
They are neither good negotiators nor are they required to be prepared to form a type of concessions.
Rae Namo, who is pushing for election reforms, had already said about the exclusion of the municipal corporation elections that are already taking place in November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have explained their use of force as an attempt by a patient movement to win concessions and economic looting from the government.
The stake of Ray Namo in the poll has been falling since 1992, while a new party, a former Ray Namo member in which the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Mejang says Mr. Gibbuzanko - who has left office at the end of his second term of office next year - wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want to leave the presidency because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want transparent elections," Ms. Mysang said.
It is not clear what kind of capacity Ray Namo has, but it has been done on a major hit-and-run visit to police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the collisions are in the province, several hundred kilometers north of Jomapouto, which hosts a port of beer that relies on exporting minerals, coal, including Rio Tinto and the valley.
After the threat of raiding the Ray Namo Line, Rio suspended its operation for nearly a week in June.
Ray Namo would be able to repeat this threat or not, Mr. Mejangvinit was almost asked.
Re Namo "Chijn wasn't going well in Mozambique who wanted to warn the international community," Mr. Majang said.
The government of instability has further increased the queues, Fernando Lima, Media Cope, who is the head of an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of kidnappings.
“People are the people who are responsible for the country’s future, the government and the president, and they feel that he should be the one to find a solution to the problems,” they say.
Omar Sultanat, a protester, people still need stability.
"Nobody cares about Ray Namo and Free Limo, they just want peace, they want free access to the streets," he said.
Children should be taught "as a model for a writer's way of life", by friends and peers.
Thor's stories could show "there's no competition for the subtleties in raw power," while the importance of being a dreamer in the eturian civilizations is known.
To teach many of the myths, too, it would not be appropriate to teach it in kindergartens and schools "even in the wild and even in some cases far away," the Cross Lee Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I find it amazing, in America, myth and folk music are already a part of the field of education," he said.
I've been doing this as a plan for 20 years.
He has called the writers and teachers "overwhelming" and it "is a new turn" for children, along with messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who has translated biowulf from Anglo Saxon as well as writing the Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales, said: "You may have a lot of intentions but it will be sold to keep it out of sight."
Perhaps an adult writer's writing for a saint and an adult writer's writing require some sense of the big difference in hope between an adult.
Everything has to come to a simple or a happy ending, because but it is a simple feeling of good and evil.
And he said that the submission should be made, but it has been said that it was revealed through a story rather than a story.
It doesn't show the old base.
The head constable Om Prakash retired after 32 years of service in the police department in Ghumraveen.

Ben Greenman: The 10th anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People may argue that New York City is the birthplace of the stand-up comedy in the United States: about a hundred years ago, the comedian Frank Fae, who worked as a master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, talked to the audience sitting in front of the audience.
Fae's search has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and run by Caroline Hersh, founder of the Standup Institute called the Carolines, this festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, which included more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of them appeared in the headlines, and became very successful, to the point where they became too big to be played in the club," says Hersh.
We built this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the presence of Vanda Sikkes, Cathy Griffin and Bill Mayer, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military retirees at Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes", including Bruce Spring
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many comedians participating in this year's festival have come from non-traditional means, such as coming on small networks such as Comedy Central, F.X. and Spike.
Nick Croll, the Deep-Cable Sitcom (F.X.'s infamously ranchy fantasy-football theme "The League"), has reached the top spot, and now has his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member for "Satterday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marshalle's Shell Vid Show on."
Other young comedians with different voices, including Croll and Slate (unfortunately disappointed voiced by Anthony Jesselnick, philanthropic, quirky, comedy-centric W.K. Bell) are the products of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival will be, an interview: David Steinberg's Larry Talk to David:
Steinberg had started working as a stand-up comedian, but he has become a renowned television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show called "Sit Down Comedy by David Steinberg" on T.V. Land.
The meeting will take place in the centre of Manhattan, in the Town Hall.
Steinberg said, "The city is definitely in the comedy D.N.A. of all the works of Larry."
They were telling me that, when they were here, they would sometimes go into the gap between the two buildings and think to themselves that if I ever lost all my money, I would stay here.
Oil continues to fall to $96 per barrel
The decline in the price of oil continues to be a worrying offset over more supplies such as Friday, where China's power-hungry construction sector is getting stronger.
The benchmark for December delivery was down 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in e-commerce at the U.S. crude New York Mercantile Exchange.
The deal fell 5.8 percent for the month of October, down 39 cents on Thursday.
Sufficient supply of crude oil has been steeped in the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supply has increased by 4.1 million barrels last week
Over five weeks, the supply has increased by more than 25 lakh barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand in the activity has come from Izaffa that two reports on Chinese manufacturing have come on Friday.
It is also clear that the development could continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after falling 7.8 per cent in the last quarter from a two-decade to a third quarter.
Brent crude also fell 26 cents from $108.58 per barrel at the ICE exchange in London, a benchmark for international crude oil used by U.S. refiners.
The court has blocked the action on the New York Police Department's rest and sport policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday called for a judge's order for the New York Police Department's break and sports program to block the changes and remove the judge from the case.
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 2 and Judge Shira Shindeler has said that the judge will await the outcome of the verdict as a result of an appeal by the city.
The judge in the town had ruled in August a violation of the Constitution in the manner of stopping the people and getting out of his program of interrogation.
The city's police department has also decided to allocate a monitoring to assist in its policy and related training program change, its findings and its curative order have been appealed.
The Appellate Court heard the pleas on the travel request on Tuesday.
The Appellate Court has held that as he had to agree the necessity for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in a series of media interviews, he had to make a misdemeanour out of the Code of Conduct for the American Judges, so the judge had to do the wrong thing.
The judge ruled that the police officers mistakenly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its rest and sports program, the judge said.
He has appointed an out-of-the-box monitor to oversee major changes including policies, training, and oversight, including economic reforms, and he has ordered a pilot program to test the body's wearing cameras in some of the campuses.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of those whose cases were dismissed after a police halt.
An oral argument on the appeal of the city is scheduled for some time after 14 March 2014.
The Recreation and Recreational Device has been criticised with civil rights lawyers.
The rest and sport policy has been around for decades in some form, but from mostly black and Hispanic men, 684330 to 2011 has recorded a dramatic halt to growth under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has been in a position to raise an all-time high.
A trial of four men was filed by all the minorities in 2004 and became a case of class action.
A supporter of the change in the NYPD's break and play programme has said that the end of the unfair conduct will be one more reliable and effective police force and could influence the use of policies of other police departments.
Opponents say the change will reduce the mentality of the police, but the crime, money loss and not over the past decade will solve a wide-ranging problem of a police force under pressure from thousands of officials.
The judge has noted that there was no end to the break and the sport, which is constitutional, but improved in the implementation of the NYPD stop.
The training included a large number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra district.
During the seven-day period, all participants were given information about various disciplines including tent pitching, flag poles.
The training is being carried out in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
All the participants are sharing the feeling of unity by joining in prayer.
Camp Principal Vipin Kumar is giving his special co-operation.
Colson has used phone hacking to confirm the secret information he's been given.
The former editor of News of the World Andy Callon has been accused of trying to confirm a so-called secret information about his credentials while he was home secretary of Charles Clarke in an attempt to "call-hacking, nigga"
Prosecutor Andrew Addis C.C. told Old Bailey that the News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was dating his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Polby.
The court said the newspaper had appointed private investigator Glenn Mulker to hack Polby's voicemail and "watch" that man, but Colson also called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Addis said that "the suggestion of the project party is that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of N.O.T.W., is not known to stand out from the people's homes and keep an eye on them, but he keeps an article in front of the people, see what people are reacting to"
He said that the N.O.T.W. used three ways to investigate the cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
In the third, the editor himself was involved.
It is obvious that in other ways, i.e., he knew about negroes, he must have known.
What about the first one?
Did he know about the phone hacking?
He says, no, we say, "Yes, he knew exactly."
The rumor about Clark's intimate relationships was first presented by A.O.T.W.'s feature desk at the time when a sexually desirable source in Mrs. Polby had said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
In August 2006, from Mulker's home, the tape of Voicemail was captured at least three times from Mrs. Polby's phone.
Investigators also found such entries in the private investigator's computer, on which Mrs. Paulbi and her sister were named "Project."
During the period during which he was being investigated, information was sought about him by calling the grandmother of Mrs. Polby's grandmother.
During this time, former chief reporter Navili Thurlbeck and former reporter James Wedarup watched Mrs. Polby's arrival and departure.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told him through a voicemail: "I've got a story that we're planning to run tomorrow, which I'd definitely like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Addis said that the inclusion of Colson in the case is in a party with other important individuals, such as former Home Secretary David Blanket.
The court heard on Thursday that, Colson had spoken to Mr. Blanket about sexual relations with a married woman while at the time he was looking into the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks who was married at the time.
Colson and Brooks refused to engage with other people to hack the phone between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulker, Thorlbeck and Vedderap have accepted the phone hacking.
With the opening of the NSA regarding state surveillance, the corporate fear was heightened.
On a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter crashed at the U.S. Trade Embassy in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
At the direction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take a picture of the roof of America's square, which is located less than 5 km away from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media asked the BfV to express hope to identify the presence of the Licensing Antenna and signaled an exchange action between the German Foreign Ministry in the US and Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, stressed that the U.S. is not trying to "steal the trade secrets of foreign companies and increase their international competitiveness or increase the line beneath them." Then sit down.
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor who has made whistleblowers, began to tell the treasure of his secrets to American surveillance, the leaders of the European government and the business world are no longer sure that the director is not necessarily following his word.
The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has investigated Brazil's oil company Petrobras, and our cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, and Yahoo, have expressed concern about state surveillance.
The last thing came when it was discovered that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, probably a decade ago.
If the most powerful people in Europe can be targeted, of course, the leaders of the business world are also likely to target.
Snowden has made deep cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible for this data to be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany should wake up," says Oliver Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n, president of BITMI, which represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by the consultancy of German companies, the United States has almost now become a major risk, such as China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
Leaked by Mr. Snowden in all the inscriptions, there is, however, so far no evidence that the United States has known the trade secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed interest in the lack of internet capabilities of the European Union. And it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
The leaders of the business world are doubting this.
In the German parliament, someone said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Haso Platner, the chairman of the German business software company SAP, said, "This is no way."
If a strong European IT industry wanted to, then it would not have allowed him to die 20 years ago.
Everything is permitted in Germany. From coal, to cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The leaked disclosure by Snowden about the U.S. technical breakthrough and spying approach has proven to be an injury to some companies that were previously thought to be China's biggest surveillance threat.
A big change is taking place in the cloud computing hole where European officials are more aware that the data stored in the US is under that jurisdiction and have therefore become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey released by Cloud Security Alliance, some 10 percent of non-U.S. members have canceled plans to use an American-based cloud provider after disclosure about the data pristine mining program.
Jim Snabe, chief executive officer with SAP, says: “We saw a new question that didn’t come to customers a year ago – that’s – my data said is stored? And can you guarantee that it will physically stay in that jurisdiction?”
Many German officials argue that the latest report is just confirming what they already knew: that the powerful state wants to steal their most insecure secrets and data and for this it should be up to them at all costs.
It is no surprise that this is an economic phenomenon.
This has always happened.
“This has been a topic for many years, and through the fundamental current discussion, nothing has changed,” says Kurt Bock, chief executive of BASF.
The US spy on us at the commercial and industrial level and we do too, because it is in the national interest to protect our business.
Corporate leaders generally don't like about the defense system and it's a benefit for the attacker.
For large companies, it has been a long time since the message is being recorded whether it is pointless to leave a home business with a USB stick, or it is pointless to leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room at least to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of the car manufacturer Audi, says,It is a very old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings because they cannot be used as remote hearing aids
Germany's BfV executive advises to consider using a simple prepaid mobile when the smartphone is in agreement because of the risk on foreign tours.
The prepaid mobile phone was then later dropped.
However, small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, it is the top of many companies in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, effectively protecting corporate secrecy against employees and financial resources' unauthorized access," BfV warns in a report.
The U.S. has warned about the economic spying of its own companies by other countries.
According to France The Washington Post, the name of the U.S. national intelligence agency in February was named after China with Russia and Israel, which is named in a second tier of criminals involved in hacking.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, when it comes to economic surveillance, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview: "The services know well that even though all countries are involved in non-terrorist warfare, they are spying on their allies."
The US spy on us at the commercial and industrial level and we do too, because it is in the national interest to protect our business.
No one is stupid.
Georgia teenager's parents killed in 'unique accident' believe their son was killed in a car accident
A teenager in Georgia whose dead body was found wrapped in a restorative mat at her high school gym believed her son had been killed, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Valdosta, G.A.'s Central Johnson was found trapped in a mat directly behind his high school gym in front of the bleachers on Jan. 11.
LONDON County Sheriff’s investigators concluded that Johnson had died in a ‘unique accident’, but the 17-year-old boy’s family denied it.
Advocates Benjamin Cromp, who introduced Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News Dottcom that "he fully believes that his son has been murdered."
He has no confidence in death at all in the manner described by the sheriff.
Cramp said that "he believes that this is beyond the logic of physical rules and common sense."
They feel that this conclusion is an excuse for the person responsible for the death of their son or for the safety of the people.
He said that "he sent his son to school with a book-back, and he came back in a body bag."
U.S. Attorney General Michael Moore said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, given that many important questions are unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he murdered because of a crime?
Moore said the matter at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, they will take us wherever we go.
My goal is to bring the truth to light.
"I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation,"" he said."
Moore told the reporter that there are indications in the intervening body test that Johnson's death occurred as a result of "situational respiration."
According to Moore, a different cause of death was found in such a second body test."
"There are a lot of questions that should be answered or confirmed,"" he said."
Moore also said that if he finds enough evidence to implicate a criminal in the case of Johnson's death or investigate civil rights, he will ask the FBI to do so.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative was not immediately available for comment from the office of the County Sheriff of London.
On Wednesday, the South Georgia judge ordered the officers, investigators, to release all surveillance videos reviewed by the investigators.
The boy's parents say they are hopeful that the video footage will get some clues as to how his death occurred.
C.D.C. has issued guidelines on allergy-related guidelines for children for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidelines to control children's food allergies in the school.
Such guidelines have been issued for the first time by the U.S. government, as the number of children going to school is increasing with food allergies.
One in 20 children in the U.S. now have food allergies.
CDC found that there has been an 18 per cent increase in cases of food allergy in children between 1997 and 2007.
In this direction, schools have been informed of how teachers and staff should be informed about the food allergy of children, and how to handle it in the event of an allergic reaction.
Schools have also been advised to keep the stock of apinephrine in order to cope with potentially known acuteness (anaphylaxis) - which is the auto-injector of the apine brand that is most commonly used.
The State Assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to easily stock more of apinephrine in bulk.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms that are communicated by the children suffering from allergic reactions.
Children can say, "It feels like something is slipping into my tongue," "It looks like my tongue has hair," or "It's slipping into my tongue."
Intersex Kids Parents Can Choose Their Children's 'Ling Indeterminate'
Germany has become the first country of the European Union to grant recognition to the third gender for children born with unexplained genitalia.
Newborn children will no longer be designated as male or female in a regular manner.
Under the new law, parents are not required to declare sex for such children, this law allows them to declare sex “indeterminate” or “indeterminate” on the child’s birth certificate.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce the pressure on parents who can make decisions related to gender-definition fees for newborn children in a timely manner, and to combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to B.B.C., an intersex person had said years later, "No, I'm a man, not a woman."
I will continue to be the injured, daggered pawn made by the doctors.
It is estimated that one out of every 2,000 children a year is a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions, which comes under the examination of disorders of sexual development, it is a collective word that is used for abnormally benign, genitalia (intestinal or reproductive), or abnormally developed.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersecting.
Gender identification is still not properly understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when there can be no gender-determination, it is better to use the best information available to specify gender and make a diagnosis and a diagnosis, if such a diagnosis is not possible.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Drescher, who is an expert on gender-identity issues, said Germany's new law "seems to be a good thing."
Intersex children create moral inconsistencies.
He said, "Some people are in a situation like a life-threatening situation for which a fee-treatment is needed, but most children don't."
You can specify sex only without a fee-treatment, and then see how the identity develops after that.
The science of knowing how to develop a gender in a child is not very accurate.
No one can give a reasonable answer as to why this happens.
It's one of the reasons why people are gay.
In a report filed before the European Commission in 2011, Intersex people have been described differently from transgender people in the form of transsexuals or transgenders, as their status is not related to gender but to their biological structure, not related to gender.
These characteristics can themselves exhibit secondary sexual characteristics, such as the weight of muscles, the distribution of hair, breast and length; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals; or qualitative structure and hair.
This report also provides insight into the discrimination faced by Intersex and transgender individuals in the field of jobs, as well as about harassment, violence and sidelined crimes.
There are now special camps for non-conformist boys.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to mark men, women, or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norie May-Welby became the world's first recognized "sexless" person after winning a legal appeal to hold "unspecified" sex status.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passport will also have the third designation as X for persons other than M or F.
According to a news report on France 24, issues related to gender in neighbouring countries in France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French law-makers from this hard-line Catholic country signed a petition from the school's books to go back to the "ling theory".
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also objected to this law of Germany saying, "While the world is going to a state where there is a choice of sex itself, but not sexual activity, we are going to the opposite of the two more pillars of civilization."
In Maryland, the mother of the newborn baby also told Baby Zone that she would like to see the children being designated for sex at birth.
He said on the website about the periphery, "Periphery is very stressful without any additional limits, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is."
Children need stability and self-reliance.
Historically, the children who were born with both male and female genitalia were called harmaphrodites (ubihalingi), which were in the name of the beautiful Greek goddess who were twins.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world regarded sex as a slot that could be deleted and then written down.
But now a lot of people are challenging the morality of peer-to-peer medicine, they understand that gender-identity is a complex task, and sometimes even doctors who don’t know what their gender will feel about when they grow up.
Dresher says that “in the mid-20th century, it was called a ‘mental emergency’.
When these babies were born, you weren't calling the psychiatrist, you were calling the psychiatrist.
The current theory of the treatment of children with unexplained genitals was presented by Dr. John Manny of John Hapkins University, who considered the sex to be benign.
He coined the word "gender identification" and argued that social and environmental cues - how parents paralyze the child - determine by intervening with the child's genes and hormones to identify him as a man or as a woman.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/John", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose sex was having an accident during lingo-suspension, to let the child out of her womb by fully binding her and to do her licking-following like a girl.
Dresher said, "Mani presented that case as a successful case of the permanent, but it did not happen."
At the age of 15, the child turned back to himself as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dr. Dresher said that some doctors are still "following the same pattern."
But with the advent of the Internet in the years after the 1990s, people undergoing these gender pay-cure began to come forward "not happy with the result".
The same case was with 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce of Montana, who was born with X.Y. male chromosomes, but his birthdate was unclear.
Doctors did not clearly understand that his gender was small, or that his godfather was large, but they were certain that he could never live a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So only a short time after her birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and endocrine system were removed and her periphery was treated like a girl.
She was given female hormone at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn’t happy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At the age of 18, he was going to be vaginoplasty with her.
But, feeling depressed and some misgivings, he demanded medical records.
This made him aware of the terrible truth.
When I was born, I was bound - and no one ever told me.
Bruce had been born with D.S.D., which prevented his body from making enough testosterone, due to which his birth could not be properly developed.
After knowing the truth, he turned back into a man, took a dose of testosterone and removed his breast.
He was discharged due to a medical condition.
Today, he explains to people about intersex individuals in an organization called the Interface Project to make their perceptions normal.
But, California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Justice, executive director Annie Tamer-Mattis, is concerned that Germany's law "invites chips and bribes."
He says, "Many activists feel that the law of Germany will inspire parents to make quick decisions and define the child as 'indeterminate'."
We are afraid that this will encourage the intervention.
We think that instead of waiting, it is a better process to specify the gender of a man or a woman.
But we don't know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Mattis said his organization supports Australian law because it "allows adults to be identified in the third gender," according to the report.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal sex,"" he said."
The law of Germany is concerned with specifying it at the time of birth.
This is not a fight being fought by young children at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their body.
But Pittsburgh's breast radiologist Dr. Erlin Barats, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder, and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said Germany's law would "give power" to both parents and children.
Baratji's daughter Katie was born with male pronouns, but she was a D.S.D. called the complete androgen insensitivity feature.
As his androgen was faulty in gray, so women's phenomena developed in CAT.
She has a vagina in her body, but she doesn't have a uterus or a dengue.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is pregnant, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"This law makes it easier for parents to make sure they don't make any decisions on their own in a hurry,"" Baratz said."
It provides them with a proper understanding and time by some test before writing ‘male’ or ‘female’.
In this way, you live well - pass the baby, love the baby.
You have a lovely child and have fun with it.
We do not need to do such a price-treatment in haste which cannot be recovered.
"This brings the children into the decision-making process and frees the parents from the bullying that inspires them because they don't believe they're doing well," he said.
Finally, the child will determine which sex he is more comfortable with -- and it will be a very good thing.
This allows children to make decisions for themselves.
A legal awareness camp was held at Ramnagar High School Dalher in Ramnagar under the chairmanship of the Tehsil Legal Services Committee Ramnagar and Sandeep Kaur under the chairmanship of all the judges of Ramnagar.
In which the students and other persons were informed of the right to education and the law for economically backward persons.
Advocates ML Gupta, Rohin Bhardwaj, and Sarpanch informed the public on the matter at the camp.
A large number of villagers were present at the event.
Report: Consider the Biden Dumping Obama Campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, President Barack Obama's close advisers quietly considered Hillary Clinton's ticket for 2012 in place of Biden in the post of Vice President.
The most notable threat in The Secret Garden is the highly anticipated 2012 campaign tom by Mark Halperin and John Helemann, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012."
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and on Thursday evening told the President's top advisers that Obama's re-election bid to know if dumping Biden could help with the prospect of having "wider group meetings and late 2011 polling."
Times National Political Reporter Jonathan Martin says the book details all the details of the effort in the campaign of the chief officials and put the bill to the head of the former White House staff to know what the former Secretary of State for the White House has to say
The possible switch was a very safe secret within the basic structure of the Chicago campaign and within the oval office.
Only half a dozen close advisors to the president – including Doyle, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axlard and David Plouffe – were under consideration.
"Double-down" claims that Doyle tried to change Biden despite his personal ultimatum, before finally making a decision when his information was telling him that Clinton's ticket would not improve on Obama's condition.
In an interview with Martin, Dale has confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"I said looking at the whole scene, and one of them, it was," Doyle told the newspaper.
You remember, when the president was in danger at the time, we were in a situation like, "Holy Christ, what else are we going to do?"
While Dale referred to the research as a "warning", Martin had told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the election campaign once again made a significant investment in finding out how much this claim would benefit the poll.
"The campaign doesn't spend on voting and focus groups like money until they're seriously considering something," Martin told AC360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dolly if his boss knew about the potential change that would take place.
While Dale said he "didn't seem to know the president about possible change," the former chief of staff thought it was "possible" that it knew Obama.
"Double down" is certain: will not answer the political inquiry and reached Obama's desk? Martin further said.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama Biden didn't know about the dumping ticket research, he said.
"Perhaps," Martin said.
Glow-in-the-dark ice cream likes?
A British entrepreneur has made use of the world's first glo-in-the-dark ice cream - jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken a lot of advantage of the marine animal to develop the best breakfasts.
He came up with this idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China made use of chemical light when re-enacting the protein.
Ice cream, which reacts with the tongue, will increase the pH level of the protein and the ice cream will glow.
Chris says that the ice cream glows with a reaction from the heat of the mouth, that is, winning will be more chateau, the more it will be illuminated.
Charlie, founder of IM Delisius Ice Cream Company, said: "It's an incredible thing but the production of the early days will get me about 2 grams of stuff from <0xC2><0xA3>200."
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with a neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is warm, the protein PH level will increase and the ice cream will glow.
We’ve been testing for the past few months and it seems perfectly right to share it on Halloween because it gives a wonderful glow effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because jellyfish's light is four times more expensive than gold
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds.
However, Iska tastes very good.
Charlie's Bristol-based experimental company is famous for its unusual flavors of apne, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf.
But his next creation has to be even more ambitious to prove.
"I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream," he said.
It's natural impossible because of the ice crystals that make up the top of the ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream has the benefit of the receptive properties of a jellyfish, which has been synthesized by Chinese scientists.
The entire market was closed to customers in the Rani Bag Market.
It was recently that people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy the bartender.
It was recently held in Vajirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market and Prashant Vihar Central Market.
A similar view was also seen at the Surrafa shops of Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town.
There, too, people bought gold and silver in abundance and coins.
As a result, other markets, including the outer ring road, were jammed.
However, people who left the office for home had to spend hours in jail to reach home.
Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay late, and play dress-up games for the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more than a lobster.
I haven't even signed in to give candy out of my apartment for the last two years and maybe not this year.
But the numbers tell us that there's a black sheep when Halloween comes.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating $158 million in Halloween this time., $6.9 billion will be spent on candy and jewelry.
One of the things I've always wanted to do is look at all the swatches.
According to NRF, the total cost of the dress from $6.9 billion is estimated to be $1.2 billion
This year, everyone is outraged by sexual inanimate objects.
Women don't have to be vegetarian, because they're like pizzas, hamburgers, and carrots.
I hope for Mardo that a lot of zombies, and thanks to Murdo's moving space will create our Instagram feeds for men this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after outfits will be Zombies, Batman, Luteers and Robbers.
I don't think there's anything wrong with being traditional.
Last year we dressed the dog and surprisingly we weren't alone.
According to the NRF, Americans will actually spend $330 million on pet clothes.
That's why there are a lot of dogs with dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't look around.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
The annual bar, lollipop, milk dots, tweeters and Clarke bar is around <0xC2><0xA3>600 million.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is a good news that 41 million trucks are participating in our neighborhood.
But in fact, we, and those who are having fun, will buy <0xC2><0xA3>90 million worth of chocolate during Halloween.
One thing we won't use during Halloween, according to the Confectioners Association, is candy corn, but it will also sell around 35 million pounds.
It is about the personal cluster of Makkah about 9 billion.
This is a secret. To solve the yet
There is nothing more fundamental than the Halloween ghostly home.
They have the best name, "terror behind the wall (which, in fact, is a prison), "cheek-o-cheek" and were like "house of shock."
According to the U.S. authorities, in fact, there are 1,200 officially approved ghost houses in the United States that generate 500 million revenue. And those awesome good photos that your friend puts on Facebook and the man who doesn't see you.
Finally, let's talk about the squid.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o-lalten necklace is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've done since we were little.
For us, the "baby in a pumpkin trend" was just the beginning of last year, so most of us got older by checking out these guards and not staying in a relationship with them.

The dream of the potato traders to do business in the potato market located in the transport area was not realized.
After the order of the High Court, the Patakha traders have been trapped in amazdar.
Neither can they now do business in the temporary mortgage market created in Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued a license for business in the Transport Area.
The commission, formed by the Punjab and Haryana High Courts, declared the temporary retail market in Ranjit Avenue unsafe during its visit.
A fine of Rs 10 lakh was imposed on Amritsar's Deputy Commissioner for lack of proper management.
The High Court, in its order, has seized Amritsar's administrative officials and said that the administration has not been able to solve even one of the difficulties of patchy traders for nine years.
They could not be made available in the proper place in the city.
After this, proper security management and patch traders were asked to issue a license for the business in the market located in Shipyard itself.
Even after the order, the Pataka traders were happy, but on their happiness the police returned the water on Friday.
The team of the Assamese license branch of the police reached the Patakha market and sold the farm by putting counters there.
After that, it was impossible for them to complete what they were told in one day.

A fire brigade was called in to rescue a lost pope on the summit of a critical mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker Spaniel Ruby had run away after coming into a small road collision
He was spotted by a dog walker trapped in a mine three days later.
Firefighters threw the front of the rock from the rails to save the dog from the mouth of death
After somehow being stuck on the mouth of a dangerous mountain 50 feet above the ground by the Pope, he found a happy life by being called to firefighters.
The nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby fled after coming into a road collision on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were in a flatpit mine in West Yorkshire to meet again at Danholm, Ruby, and he has thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After a small accident after his escape, he had searched like crazy for his lost dog, and an appeal post was made on social networking sites.
On Wednesday at 2.15 p.m., a fast-watching doc Walker spotted Ruby on the mountain at a height of 50 feet from the ground.
A technical rescue team arrived at the scene from Clackington Fire Station and used a belly tube to get down by the rail to rescue Ruby and bring her down from the rock.
Expert Technical Defence Officer Andy Clayton said: "She was in a critical situation.
She was in the middle of the front of the rock, 50 feet above and below.
He did not do a single act during the rescue, he had become a stone.
But now he's good.
After that, she was eating biscuits.
It was a call for extraordinary help.
It's amazing to see the dog.
Special Technical Defence Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby has survived in a fortunate manner."
He was likely to be seriously injured or even in an even worse condition.
Ruby was taken to an animal doctor for examination, where she was found to be good in addition to fatigue and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was terrible to see the rescue work."
At first I couldn’t believe how she got there.
It's amazing to get him back in his hands.
The veterinarian said that if she was too tired and fell, she would definitely fall down.
The fire department did a very good job.
What he did is really a very brave job.
We were the best, and they were all the best.
Mr. Alderson from Kigli also said: "We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fire department did a great job.
I can't believe how he got there.
Mick Jagger says when Katy Perry was 18, she didn't attack him
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, Pon Star said he had been singing backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry said he had dinner with senior rocker, and said, "When I was 18, he beat me."
He said, "It's getting old, and he's doing good with me."
A 70-year-old Jagger's representative said in a statement on Thursday that he "clearly denies about ever hitting Katy Perry."
The representative also said: "Perhaps Perry is talking about them in the misunderstanding of someone else"

George Kerreven: The European Union has chosen the Scots.
Another day, another story of the fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that as a condition of EU membership, independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel area throughout Europe as a condition of EU membership.
The passport control on the Barvik and the border of the contile wire on the walls of the Hadrian indicate stories about the boundary of the wire.
It is true that the Strathclyde Paper described the potential economic benefits of independent entry with the rest of Europe, although - predictably - it was not described in the headlines.
Neither has anyone described that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules to suit their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer a Schengen area, so Brussels will be a cheap discount for the non-compliance Brussels in exchange for getting what it really wants from Scotland, instead of getting it.
So, then, non-stop.
And the thing that has been stuck for such a long time, she has collapsed. First of all, I heard the unsubstantiated news about about 40 years ago, "freedom means passport control."
Still, this interesting old story lost an interesting point in rehearsing.
Why should we expect to be biding Europe from independent Scotland anyway?
Why do you want to buy and sell yoghurt in London, especially now?
Here's the real European news: The great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
All over the EU, the dedicated parties are getting stronger to oppose the EU or shut down the euro as a similar currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party - which was founded this year - suddenly got about fifty lakh votes in the federal elections in September, and thus from the Free Democrats (our own lib-dems.com)
The plan to build a federal Europe has always been domestically opposed.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be a major change.
As well as the strict rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people are having to think that the project Europe has gone too far due to obstacles imposed on national economies through the implementation of the same currency.
The euro crisis did not play much role in the excessive budget loss of national governments - that was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system has stabilized the exchange rate in favour of German exporters to its members - something that the German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself in a situation of inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only measure is to reduce wages and public spending - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
The current budget and currency problems are far beyond the reach of deep European productivity.
To provide discounts to French and German energy firms at the expense of consumers - as a result of the "green" energy policies put in place by Brussels, the European industry doubles for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United Nations.
This is the cost-effective cost of panguing, which we people have already seen in the grangemouth.
While all wages are being frozen in the world, the European petrochemicals industry cannot be spared from being affected by cheap U.S. shale gas.
As a result, the feeling of rebellion has been raging in people, especially in France, which was once the main fan of the European Union.
After the Jews, France's top politicians saw the European Union as a means of keeping Germany under control, and Paris as a means of providing billing equal to Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, which is causing France's economy to collapse.
The result: The anti-EU National Front of Marine Lee Pen has won by pushing the ruling socialist to third place in the recent bye-election.
At the moment, the front is the most popular party with 24 percent of the vote in France - it's a simultaneous warning to the British Labour that they can't run by claiming that the disintegration for the left, will have benefits for the right itself.
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity in the middle of the French mountains, working class?
The party wants to make use of next year's EU elections in the European Parliament to form the EU's anti-EU, anti-currency group.
If, as is very possible, the EU opposition parties perform well in these elections, such a group can for the first time influence the European Parliament.
My view is this: soon in Europe, a combination of the anti-EU and the highest anti-currency sentiment will put an end to the euro.
The euro will not be completely over, but it will come back on foot in a form like the "Europe of (the Lord's) Nations" that will be backed by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its untouched economies can sustain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I hope that the U.K. will keep itself away from this project in hopes of increasing close ties with the U.S.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific indicates that the UK will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What's next for Scotland?
We can choose to stay in the region of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can protect our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels to stand out at the right time.
I think Scotland can do a better job in a loose European system, provided that we keep our own currency. . . .
It will be easier to work together with other countries with similar thinking in Europe of non-federal nations.
Otherwise, we should think about maintaining our economic freedom while on the road to Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland - notably - has been the most successful anti-spam political campaign in Europe in the past, which was proposed by the Chancellor of Labour, Elister Darling, to oppose (such as the Acting) the curfews in Kejriwal 2011
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for freedom at this time, because in that situation it would have to accept the rules of austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Young people ahead of time: growing up fast
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls are getting younger at a younger age than those of their own age, according to the study.
Physical change does not mean that the youth is near.
There is no evidence that hormone or any other chemical can be blamed.
Experts believe that sturdiness outbreaks can be a cause of youth at a young age
The case of young people ahead of time is not as effective in boys
Pat Etheridge, a former C.N.N. journalist, is an expert on the health and family issues of children.
Should the mother be worried if her daughter starts developing breasts at the age of 7 or 8 years and the hair of the unborn child begins to grow?
This week, at the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplowitz made it clear that these initial physical changes are common in American girls.
"I spend a lot of time giving parents this confidence - that it usually doesn't reflect the rapid progress in the direction of full youth," Caplovitz says.
The direct symptoms of development such as ankylosing of the breasts, genital and throat hair and physical smells have been seen in girls ahead of time.
But there has been a very slight change in the age of razodarshan (first monthly-religion) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years in the first trimester," says Caplovitz, who is also the author of "Time-Forward Youth in Girls: A Guide to Dealing with This Common Problem."
The most accurate test time for the development of youth is time.
What is the beginning of youth, there is debate about what, but when there is an increase with breast development before the age of 8 years, two call it "child-adult".
In most cases, this process will slow down or stop - which the hair doctor can closely monitor.
An endocrinologist may be required to perform an examination in the event of a more rapid progression so that the chances of serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be removed.
There are treatments to delay time-pre-monthly-religion and other outcomes: time-pre-age-growth of the organs, which can lead to abnormal growth and seizures as an adult.
The structures for the treatment of drugs or hormones depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth, and emotional maturity.
The psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is aware of the drugs but admits, "The pressure on the young can increase behavioral issues, and girls may feel different from their peers."
The second big problem can be understood: the parent just doesn’t want their younger daughter to have a monthly religion.
"They're worried about the risk of pregnancy, or how they're going to maintain cleanliness," Caplovitz said.
A woman, whose daughter had started monthly religion at the age of 10, recalls, "It was a shock."
Although there were symptoms of this and we had also talked about monthly-religion, she was not emotionally prepared.
He was afraid of his school and became upset that he had begun monthly religion at first in his savings.
There are many hypocritical theories about the causes of premature youth.
However, there is no consistent evidence to suggest that hormone in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexually explicit messages in the media, could be charged.
Boys - just like girls - are getting time-to-pre-teens.
Caplovites determine the rule that the main cause of this is an outbreak of sturdiness.
He had helped run studies on girls aged 6 to 9 years in the year 2001, which connects body fat with teenage years.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are also many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls have a tendency to get young before their age-old blonde girls.
There is a lot of explanation for this.
At the global level, the form of time-previous youth, from economic conditions to weather and jeans, all things seem to be affected.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at a young age, the course of youth is not as clear as girls in them.
The other doctors present at the A.A.P. conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see moustache and genital hair.
The pediatric endocrinologist, Dr. Lawrence Silverman, says, "We need to be careful about what we do as a young man's real beginnings," at Goreeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their pediatrician to take an opinion on how to talk to their children.
Caplovitz advised, "This may mean negotiating ahead of the expected time."
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond correctly.
Prematurely developing girls need to be given the confidence that even if it is premature to time but it is part of normal life.

Large orders of jet manufacturers from dispute to seat width on the right.
This month's Dubai Arsho has been set up as a hub for the fight between the leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-haul flights.
The dispute is focused on the seat width of the Economy Class in the long-haul aircraft, not as always given by the airlines but whose divided seat efficiency has been claimed to be key by the latest jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company.
Airbus is hoping to give a detailed seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economy cabin this week but it should be decided by the airlines, says its main-resistance Boeing.
The dispute arises between the aircraft manufacturers when the purchase of the large Verson of the long-range aircraft engine from the possible order entered after the incident of 17-21 began to sell.
How is the aircraft's previous department built - especially if the seating is equal to 9 or 10 more capacity claims taking into account the design of the mini-jumbo jets being prepared?
Boeing says it has created the "777 X" which will put 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 logos in a row in the unicameral department.
The Airbus says it will take 350 people to the same seat as the A350, leaving 18 inches behind.
Aircraft giants often trade on technical matters through advertising in the commercial press. . . .
Now, the Airbus 777 X is hoping to dominate more than 100 orders in Dubai Arsho, further appealing to the public.
Recently it has been seen that whatever the beginning of the war was going to be this show to Finsero, together in a restaurant, will you accept it?
John Lehi, head of Airbus sales, said: "The Boeing Regional Turbo is also offering long-haul flights to Sancreise.
As a change, people are getting great, but the way the plane sits has not changed.
According to the U.S. Department of Health data, between the 1970s when Boeing 747 jumbo ne defined modern long-term travel as tha, and the ant me of the century averaged 40-49 years old American male ke weight me 10 percent increase.
According to the U.S. Health Statistics, the average American male’s waistline in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rival has been stuck with a 1950s seat concept when the new name "Jet Set" was an average term coin.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission that suggests an additional 53 per cent improvement in the quality of sleep in the width of the seat.
Boeing has disputed Airbus's seat measurement figures, saying it does not depend on the decision of the manufacturers on how to rent the airline and make a balance between the facilities.
It also says, that the research shows that the width of a seat depends on the experience of the cabin more than the width of a seat.
"It's really about providing flexibility to airlines and trusting things that they need to do to be successful," said Kent Crawler, a Boeing cabin expert, in a statement.
"They don't want to tell us what benefits they have."
They know their business better than anyone else's.
It’s about the corner room for flyers, but for suppliers it’s quickly an issue that can affect revenue.
The trade of at least $700 billion is estimated to be behind this dispute, enough to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports in the coming decades.
For the first time in July, the seat layout is actually a battle issue between the new jet aircraft, Reuters reported.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that 20 per cent efficiency per seat has been achieved in their new joint engine design of the segment, compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 R.
The Boeing's performance claims depend on the 10's 777 X One's design compared to the 777's original 9's.
A comparison of 10 equals the profit in unit cost has now been used.
Kevin Keniston, head of Europe's Airbus passenger facility, says "Boing's aircraft is doing it to capture more seats to make our products, with more competitive."
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-row cabin is suggested for the existing 777 S that many passengers are on the side of the denser layout, which can go along with cheap rentals.
"The 18-inch seat width for passengers will be very good, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is driven by the threat of 777," said my carbi, founder and editor of the Runway Girls Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list of suppliers to choose from for airlines.
Jet sellers around the world also take careful measures to check out this Lewts competition.
While more relaxed, all builders are also providing low-cost aircraft services to jet aircraft and high-density layouts for regional travel.
The Airbus is offering a 10 Equivalent A350 but says it is not sold yet.
But until recently, Airbus has emphasized on extensive cabin seats on some of its jet aircraft for the need for more cabin facilities.
It is unlikely to fly at a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers of modern jet aircraft, but it can distract from the wave of sales of the 777 X.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine may end the enjoyment of smoking.
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine, which can eliminate the pleasure that comes from smoking. . . .
The same dose of the vaccine, mice were able to stay safe from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
The test on humans requires further and further testing, which may take many years, but New York-based professor Ronald Crystal, of the College of Veterinary Medicine, said the intervening signs are positive.
Prof. Cornell said, "We very much hope that the strategy of this type of vaccine can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking while using all the methods available in the market today, but they have tried to quit smoking," he said.
The new vaccine has a harmless virus, which has been designed to deliver genetic information for the purpose of creating anti-nicotine antibodies.
This virus selectively infects the cell, which then begins to form a permanent strand of the antibody.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, and prevent them from getting up into the nicotine pool inside the smoker by inactivating them before they reach the brain.
In the trial, vaccinated mice who were given nicotine later on, were doing their normal activities.
The researchers say that but the mouse that was not given the vaccine "feel good", it was a sign that nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in a journal called Science Translational Medicine.
The previous Tambaku vaccine had failed because they had antibodies in them.
It had to be administered on a regular basis to keep the level of antibodies, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be too high, as the liver will make the cell an antibody factory.
"Professor Crystal said that if the human vaccine of the future was completely safe, it could be given to children, before the cigarette test, so that they could be protected from nicotine addiction.
But perhaps its use will be used by smokers to quit smoking by those who smoke.
"They will find out that if they start smoking again, they won't get any pleasure from smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help to get rid of their habit," he said.
British scientists described the results as interesting, but warned of the need to do too much research.
Even after postmortem, Baghin could not recover due to the real cause of death.
The forest department is responding to the bullet in this regard, the first sighting of Baghin's death being natural.
On Thursday night, forest workers of Ramnagar Forest Prabhag found the body of a tiger near the Pawalgarh Conservancy Reserve Kishdi Nale.
While all the organs of Baghin's body were safe, there were no signs of injuries or injuries etc.
Forest conservationist Vivek Pandey, CTR Deputy Director Saket Badola, DFO Kakasha Nasim, SDO G.S. Karki, CTR Animal Physician Bharat and Kotabagh Animal Physician Hema Rathore
According to sources, Baghin's internal body was said to have deteriorated during the postmortem.
This did not identify the cause of Baghin's actual death.
Departmental officials were responding to Baghin's death.
However, IVRI Bareli has been sent to Baghin's internal organs for a top-level clinical examination to confirm the poisoning.
Forest conservationist Vivek Pandey said the death of Baghin could be said to be natural.
No signs of poisoning have been found from Baghin's body, etc.
However, it is sending a separate inquiry for confirmation of the poison as well as searching the surrounding area for it.
Tripods deny that we are being affected by opioids.
Former N.S.W. Labour Minister Joa Tripodi will be examined by State Corpson Watchdog.
Former N.S.W. Labour Minister Joa Tripodi has denied the denial of policy at the request of her political guru, Ad Obaid, former protector of New South Wales, Ad Obaid, whose government-controlled three landmines
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday elaborated on the inquiry into whether Mr. Obaid violated the perimeter of the Parvi Bar Policy from several State Ministers? Where Obaid owned two restaurants and a cafe at his time, without a waiter
After the evidence given on Thursday by Lin Aspole, the former Deputy Chief of Staff, Mr. Tripodi knew the secret interest of Mr. Obaid? The investigation is now underway.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had put pressure on the launch of public tenders for ribbons.
The tenants were against it and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the circulation of the paper for the ribbons, which earned Obaid $2.5 crore a year, was renewed from the ribbonless tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of the Public Tender.
But he refused to change at the request of Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripodi had urged a change in the government lease policy.
The transcripts presented in a phone call were from ICAC in August and September 2007 to Mr. Obaid and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Don, a senior official who had come to the Fisheries Department of Mr. Obaid after the Ministry of Ports worked.
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi. "Was the development of commercial lease policy being discussed in the telephone conversation of the case?"
"No," replied Mr. Tripod.
I can’t remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn’t.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obaid.
Officials say Israeli fighter jets have flown in Syria.
Israeli warplanes targeted Syria's port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administrative official confirmed by Fox News.
The officer did not say what the target was, but there was at least one target required.
According to the Associated Press, the target was the Russian SA-125 missile.
At least twice this year, Israel has failed to carry out airstrikes on missiles inside Syria.
Foreign employees on 457 visas can pass the "certificate" test
The government is considering a "certificate" test for foreign employees on 457 visas, as its aim is to extend a strict procedure.
If passed, this test will be implemented through a standard created to prevent 457 being used to fill in incapacitated positions in Australia or to provide access to family and friends in a voluntary manner.
A government discussion letter was issued today, condemning the government's lexicon of foreign employees, former Labour MP Maxine McQue said today that it could infuriate Australia's neighboring countries.
He told the U.S. India Institute today that "foreigners are reaching the end of the queue" and a strong statement about "Australian people before work" is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when the Unions have demanded a safe labour market.
Historically, it meant that white workers should be given protection - and I wouldn't be surprised if some people in the area saw the echo of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures on which the former immigration minister, Chris Bowen, had previously considered.
Immigration Minister Brandon O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials about the people he was recruiting, has implemented five structural changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "certificate" criterion is adopted, the examination of the visa applicant may be made as to whether "the nomination is true in circumstances in which the nominee, the visa sponsor's owner or the relevant person's relative stranger.
Businesses may need to keep a count of the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessperson who wanted to sponsor fewer employees put hundreds of people on the job.
During this time, 35-year-old Sri Lankan Sharan Sadhak died of a suspected heart attack after arriving in a refugee ship on Christmas Island this week.
The man's nearly nine-year-old son had come to Australia on a trip with him, and on Wednesday after his father's death, an older brother has tied the knot, which was on the same boat.
Australian officials rushed the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died, where he was taken to the hospital.
The study has been announced by the British government for an increase in Scotland's profits from the HS2 Rail project.
Work by HS2 indicates high-speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will begin soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kremer said the project "will make Britain one."
Scotland's transport minister, Keith Brown, said he was very "excited" by working with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the second stage is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and the leaders.
In June, the government revised the cost of building a high-speed link between London and Northern England to <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion.
The British government, which was negotiating with Scotland transport, directed HS2 Ltd to consider the possibilities of improving rail capacity and travel time for Northern England and Scotland, and the possibility of making it even better.
This includes the possibility of reducing the travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Creamer: "Our goal for HS2 is a real national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2, as its benefits will be very high.
Without this, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it’s also about the connectivity of 18 UK cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be well connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Elister Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichael for Scotland's "clear" return to the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "Scotland is likely to have a heavy economic advantage from high-speed rail, but this will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the entire case of high-speed rail in the whole of the UK.
So we are excited to work in partnership with the British Government, so that we can bring high-speed rail to Scotland, create benefits for all and meet the Glasgow-Edinburgh line. The Scottish Government has already proposed
I am ready to review the investigation report with the Ministers of the British Government next year and take a decision together on further action.

In the U.S., the move to softly comply with device-related regulations will have to continue to shut down your tablet and smartphone while flying, as well as when flying.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left options open for U.S. aircraft service companies to change their processes, so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices, as well as be able to "play" games on their devices.
Travelers can do so right now during a lot of flights, but many people don't feel like being able to fill the flight and reach their e-book etc. when they get off the plane.
Australian Air Service Companies are considering this decision, according to which U.S. Air Service Companies will have to do a lot of work to meet this need, but they have indicated that they do not have an immediate plan to make changes to their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that the ban on the use of electrical equipment is still effective in key phases of flight in Australia.
"Currently near CASA, there is no specific regulation controlling the operation of electrical equipment in the aircraft by the controllers," the Authority said, "This issue comes under the regulations, according to which the controllers of the aircraft service operators have to ensure the safety and security of the aircraft.
Vergin, who is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of his in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but has asked for further action on Vinayamak's instructions.
"We will welcome the review by CASA in the case of allowing the use of electrical devices, because we really feel that it will provide better experience to customers, because now we have (virals in-flight) devices," the spokesperson said.
Quantas said it would comply with the current rules at the moment.
"Electrical equipment cannot be used during flight filling and landing as per our current policy, and we have no immediate plan to change it," he said.
The FAA Decisions are applicable to U.S. allergens.
By the way, we are always interested in such lucrative developments that can benefit the passengers and we will certainly consider the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different on each U.S. airline and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Aircraft service companies will need to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, as well as they will have to adapt to give their rules books, training materials, carry-on luggage program and brief details to passengers.
"Following the verification of the airline's compliance with its aircraft, the FAA will allow passengers to use electrical devices of light weight, such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones, at all altitudes," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the driver team will instruct the passengers to turn off their equipment during the flight.
The group has also suggested placing heavy equipment under the seat in a safe manner during the flight and landing or in the upper boxes.
Silver of ponbrokers due to perceived hardship by the middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirthalinga is taking cash to pay for her daughter's school fees at a poncho at the Bandemier Shopping Centre in Singapore.
Mrs. Amirthalinga said, "My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it."
He says that, although he earns $3,000 Singapore dollars (2,400 U.S. dollars) as an administrator, and his husband also works, but the family's monthly income remains insufficient.
In fact, there is a similar demand in parts of South-East Asia - where domestic debt is increasing - the valuemax where they are trading, this week is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. The third poncho to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Not the only way to get the money to keep the jewelry - $1,300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthlinga - but almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Ponbrokar generally takes interest in Singapore at 17 per cent per year, which is slightly higher than the 15.4 per cent offered by the United Oversight Bank, which is a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, Ponbrokers have the benefit of not having the need for a credit check or proof of pay, and they can make loans available faster than the bank.
Millions of people in the region are facing ponshops because of the rising cost of living and livelihoods by families, as well as difficulties due to the increase in household and consumer loans.
After five years of strong growth after the global financial crisis, and after cheap credit due to a simple monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are struggling to meet their needs due to the collapse of their economy.
This week, the rating agency, the Standard Angels Powers, described domestic profits as a risk factor for the indebtedness of Asian banks as rising mainly due to mortgages (mortgages).
It said that in Asia, the ratio of gross domestic product in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore is the highest domestic debt.
With 80 per cent of GDP, Malaysia is on the top spot in this list, while in 2008 it was 60 per cent.
Economists in Thailand are concerned about the high levels of consumer debt, which this week has risen slightly from the tech recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a decline in constant export decline and consumer demand.
Song Seng Wwan, an economist at Malaysian Bank, CIMB, said, "The decisive point is that with rising prices, people coming in the middle of [income scale] will try to increase their income as much as possible."
Historically high prices in gold prices over the past two years have inspired people to keep personal assets low, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to pay off the value of their family's jewelry.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the gold items deposited in the 200-pound outlet of the city-state are gold.
People are saying, "The feeling of gold is good, let's put the mother's gold chain down, and take it back next month.
Thailand's largest ponshop manager, Ejimani, has seen a 20 per cent increase in the number of customers using its outlet in recent months.
There is so much growth in the holding business that there are 15 others like Outlet Managers Valumax in Bendimir and 15 others like this in Singapore, not only in their neighborhood, are planning to expand to Malaysia, where there are four stores in Yogyakarta, but also in Visakhapatnam and Asia.
The company will use 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars received in this week's listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange for its financing.
While some discount lenders (loaners) have been criticized for their high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that holding a mortgage not only gets a cheaper rate than other lenders, but it does not directly increase in debt.
They say, "Consumers keep items that they already have, and don't increase the amount of personal assets in a household loan.
The social acceptability of ponbrooking to obtain short-term and secure financial assistance is increasing.
It is not that ponbrokers use only the financially weak person.
In Singapore, wealthy people also use the ValueMax outlet, which keeps gold bars or Rolex watches down so that up to 60 per cent of their purchase price can be paid in cash.
We have clients from all walks of life.
Ms. Jah says, "These include wealthy people who need a loan for a short period of time for business ventures or investments, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow requirements."
Sometimes they just need money in a very short period of time.

Tagi's $325 Million Savings Package for Health
The Union government has stressed that strict conditions are also associated with a defence package of $325 million for Tasmania's ill-health system, which will ensure that the state government can not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plybersek has announced that the National Assembly, the island state's elderly population, high rates of kidney disease, and "immediate action" to resolve the current crisis due to the system's borders.
The decision to finance the four-year period was made after consultation of the government with Tasmania's independent MP Andrew Wilki.
"The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the specific challenges facing the state,"" said Ms. Plibersek."
The $325 million package also includes an alternative surgery plan of $31 million.
Additional 2,600 surgeries, including Orthopaedic and Motiabind surgeries, will help resolve the past accumulated cases.
It includes a walk-in clinic in Hobart and Lancestation, better care after going to the hospital, training of medical professionals, mental health services and personal electronic health records system in local hospitals. It is also the beginning of the construction of an electronic health record system.
"This investment is in line with the best ways I have been told by leading doctors to improve the health system of Tasmania," said Ms. Plibersek.
"""The Tasmanian government will face tough reporting and accountability,"" the minister said."
The state will have to maintain the current funding-nutrition level to get the NCP funds, and every month it will have to report where the additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that services are provided as effectively and efficiently as possible by the State.
Mr. Vilki said that the $325 million will not be much, "until there is no real improvement to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more transportable level."
Yet he praised the government for responding to their request for immediate assistance, which they first brought before the Prime Minister in early May."
"I hope that the Federal Assistance Package will prove very helpful in the direction of separating the State Re Public Health System from the crisis-affected list," said Mr. Wilki.
According to the State Government, these additional alternative processes will mainly precede the cuts made in the recent past.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "band-ed solution."
"We're here because the Labor State government has brought in $430 million in its health care system," he told ABCTV.
You can't think of being taken by the state government about half a billion dollars and given $300 million by the National Assembly as a good news day.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plumbersek should be given a guarantee that not one dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional employment.
The novel by Denis Dederot is the best production design and description of the time period in conversion by Giloum Niklauks, but it has become much more than it should have been.
This novel, depicting the time of France in the 1760s, tells the sad story of the young Reese, who is sent to the Convent by his family members.
When she rebels, she confronts the extreme cruelty of the hands of the volunteer wrestler Mother Superior, and becomes an object of attraction to the other.
This movie never goes in the mood or the mood - and that's the problem.
Due to the strong seriousness of the narrative, it also risks becoming a boring film for the audience.
CSA vice-president Dr Munna Singh has decided to impose entrance fees in the garden due to the widespread mud in the garden.
At the same time, the department has given a 15-day altimeter to correct the curfew.
The Vice-Chancellor, along with the Park Department, conducted a detailed inspection of the Deputy Director Seeds and Areas and Director Research on Friday morning at 10 a.m.
During this time, he found more than a dozen employees including directors in these departments from his seat.
He warned that the next time he was found missing after the rape, he would cut the salary.
Dr. Naushad Khan, the university's media manager, said that Rs 30 will have to be built for the entire month.
On a daily basis, people will be able to go to the garden for a fee of Rs.
Work will be done by the system: files related to various functions will be accessed under a system in front of the vice president.
Not every employee will have the right to file his file with the Vice President's office.
The relevant officers will reach out to their final Vice-President.
The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its ability to build its own chemical weapons, he said.
The monitoring group said on Thursday that Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas war materials, while in the northern part of Syria there has been a fierce struggle, which is very close to where the toxic agents have gone.
At the same time, on Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group said about 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the Syrian civil war, which began nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Chemical Weapons Ban Organization was made a day before the last date of November 1st.
The Hague-based organization had ordered Damascus to either destroy or "make ineffective" the machinery used to assemble and fill chemicals in all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and to destroy the machinery used to fill in war materials.
Mainly completing the initial phase of destruction, this ambitious event is a milestone which aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by the middle of the year 2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the existing weaponry and collection.
It is believed that Syria currently has 1000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including master gas and nerve agent sarin.
Britain's situation with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that the announcement came at a time when the fighting in the city of Safira escalated on Thursday, which experts believe to be the chemical weapons production unit as well as storage.
The movement group, which details the death toll through the movement's network in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
Of these, 61,067 are common citizens, including 6,365 children, he said.
The government has said that 29,954 are members of President Bashar al-Assad's military, 18,678 are government fighters and 187 Lebanese are Hezbollah insurgents.
It also said that the dead include 2,202 army vandals and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the U.N. estimated that about 100,000 people have died in the ongoing fighting since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
About 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country due to this struggle.
Asad's military was fighting rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of whom were affiliated with al-Qaida groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said that people on both sides have been killed, but said nothing clearly.
This war reflects the threat faced by inspectors of chemical weapons, who have a mission to end toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing domestic war in a very short time-limit.
In a statement, O.P.C.W., working with the United Nations, said that its team "is now satisfied and has confirmed - and has seen all of Syria's declared important production and mixing/filling equipment - in the form of destruction."
It also said, "No further plan of monitoring activity is being planned."
Earlier this week, inspectors had said that they had gone to 21 of the 23 centres declared by Damascus and completed the first phase of the confirmation work.
The inspectors said they were not able to go to two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, O.P.C.W. said that according to Syria, these two centers "have been given speed and ... chemical weapons products placed there were delivered to other declared centers, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira, is one of the two centres where the inspectors of O.P.C.W. were not able to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the executive committee of OPCW next month.
Ahamt Ujumku, Director General of the Group, observed in the comment issued by O.P.C.W., said, "I salute the steadfastness and enthusiasm shown by you in fulfilling the most challenging mission undertaken by this organization so far."
This three-year-old civil war has been mainly fought by the Assad government and its security forces, which have emerged from Shia Islam, including members of the far-right wing, and the insurgent Sunni Muslim-majority struggle.
In another incident, Rami Abdurrahman, head of the Observatory, said that a massive explosion took place on Wednesday at the Air Defence Centre in Latakia, a coastal area of Syria.
The cause of the explosion is not yet known, he said.
The police have recovered photo copies of the leaked register, leaked wallets, laptops and the leaked register from the possession of the accused.
The Moti Nagar police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Parmjit Singh Gill said the accused are Rajiv Agarwal of the city of Haboval and Kumar Mandi, Kamal Krishna Jaswal, Gurinder Singh Gaggi and Kumar Mandi of the city of Haboval.
Balbir Singh of the Register Office (East) has fled the spot.
According to the police, the accused had taken the paper out of the records of empty and old lands together with the clerk and recorder of the registry office, Balbir Singh, and thereafter bought new stamp papers and made a leaked register on them.
This is not the case when the actual register was lost and the register was added to the record.
After that, the accused sold the land on Jali paper for crores of rupees.
On the other hand, they borrowed money from the bank.
After that, the real owner of the land remained under pressure from the police and administration.
The accused, who was preparing the Jali register, was keeping a special eye on the lands of NRIG.
Because there is no one to oversee the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it remains easy to prepare and sell the net register of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said the accused said in an inquiry that they have so far produced close to 150 leaked records.
According to police, cases of fraud and theft have already been registered against Sargana Rajeev of the group.
Accusations on the punishment of suspect of bomb blast in Bali
In 2002, the families and relatives of 202 people who were killed in the bomb attack said that Umar Patek should face a firing squad, adding that the perpetrators of the bomb blasts had to be executed.
Patek, who had been running as one of the most wanted individuals in South-East Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years for his role in building the explosive device used in the bomb blast.
He can be released within 15 years if the parole is given.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in Kuta's famous tourist area, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring many.
He has also been found guilty of many other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bomb blasts in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in the year 2000.
Prosecutors had demanded the sentence of life imprisonment, although they could also demand that the person known as the master-builder of the bomb be the death sentence of the person who is said to be the famous "distorting person."
The decision renewed the painful memories of a woman in Perth who had lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stopping his desires, he said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really feel like he should have been punished just like the other brutal terrorists.
Ms. Courtin said to A.A.P., "It should be stood before the firing squad."
I have to live every day without my nanny and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., the club's name sign was removed after the bomb exploded in a stand-out van outside the club.
Peter Hughes was in the paddy bar at the time of the explosion just 20 seconds earlier of the bagpack filled with explosive material by the suicide attackers.
They went into a month-long coma as a result of the bomb explosion and died three times during their stay on life-protective devices.
Mr. Hughes says that Patek should have received the same punishment as the three other members of the Jammah Islamic terrorist group responsible for this massacre - Amroghi, Mukhals and Imam Marra - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be sentenced to death before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive, see, there is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless people, it is not enough to get a 20-year sentence.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of one of the Bali bomb blasts.
He was avoiding arrest for nearly a decade, but was finally arrested in January 2011, in Abbatabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. military had killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the F.B.I. Agent had submitted evidence that the report found that Patek Pachi in an attempt to re-establish contact between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda in an attempt to re-establish contact with Bill Ladan.
Ms. Courtin says, "He did not commit suicide."
Even today, it's not really a pain to get so many people to suffer mental pain.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
Mrs. Courtin said, "There will be a lot of tears this year."
Patek still can appeal against his punishment.
F.A.A.: Air travel can now use the gadget in the aircraft (but can't call from the cell phone)
Airplane passengers will be able to use their electronic device to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music - but will not be able to talk to their cell phone - such is the federal flight of Anantha on Thursday
However, passengers should not expect this change immediately.
In a news conference, F.A.A. Administrator Michael Huerta said how fast these changes are being implemented will be different in each airline.
The F.A.A. will have to demonstrate to the F.A. how their aircraft, how they meet the new guidelines, and the training books of the members of their driving team to show the guidelines. How the rules are used to collect the devices
The F.A. has already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft, the FAA said.
Delta and JetBlue are among those airlines that have already submitted the plans.
In a statement, the F.A. said, "Based on the status of the scheme, we can accept the extended use of the electronic device very soon.
Currently, passengers are required to close their smartphone, tablet, and other devices when the aircraft's door is closed.
They are expected not to turn them on until they reach the altitude of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and are allowed by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their device again when they land on the plane, and do not turn it on until the plane fully lands.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic handling, pay for their passengers by plane, fly when the aircraft lands and use the vehicle at the time of taxiing, the F.A.A. said.
Most new airlines and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
The president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, Laura Glading, has welcomed these changes.
"When the policy is implemented in a safe manner - and we will work together with airlines to do so - it will be a win-win thing for both parties," Glading said in a statement.
When it comes to this issue, we're tired of feeling like "holl monitors."
The agency said, however, browsing the Internet at a height of less than 10,000 feet, exchanging emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be prohibited.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in Airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversation with friends, online Scrabble-like game, which is associated with the famous incident that when actor Alex Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while at the airport at the door, Umayyad was playing on his device by him
And heavy equipment such as laptops, etc. will still have to be collected as their flight will cause concern to the other person in the cabin.
Cell phone calls will also continue to be banned during the flight.
The concessional rights related to the phone call are held by the Federal Communications Commission, not by the FAA.
F.A.A. may remove restrictions on certain electronic devices during the flight and take-off of the aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rozenkan of the National Transport Safety Board, who is the national transport safety expert at CBS News, said the cell phone is still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really serious issues, but not because they can potentially cause disruption in the navigation-related device, but also because they can cause disruption in the cell phone towers when they are in the air," Rojankar said.
The Industry World Advisory Committee, set up by the FAA to examine this issue, has framed last month that the government should allow more use of the personal electronic device.
The pressure on the FAA has been increasing in recent years to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critic such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo has stated that there is no legitimate security reason for the ban.
It is becoming even more difficult to enforce these restrictions because the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies also show that nearly a third of passengers forget or ignore the instructions to shut down their device. . . .
F.A. began prohibiting the use of electronic devices by passengers in the year 1996 when by passengers carried by F.M. Radio and high-tech gadgets of the time. The report of the disposition was obtained in the navigation and communication tools.
The new airlines are more dependent on the electrical system than the previous generation of the aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by the F.A. to be resistant to electronic interference.
The airlines have been offering the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes from passengers for many years.
The modified aircraft for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to handling.
Huerta said most airlines should take into account eligibility criteria for more use of the electronic device under the new guidelines, according to the report.
Today's electronic device emits very low-power radio transmissions compared to the previous generation's electronic device, according to the report.
For example, e-readers, when the page is returned, there is a transmission of exactly the name tag.
But the transmissions are strong when the data is downloaded or sent by the device.
Amazon.com has also been one of the parties to reduce restrictions on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011, the company's officers loaded its entire Kindle e-readers into the airline and flew it to test the problems but found no such problem.
The F.A.A. Advisory Committee on Risks arising from the use of the device has expressed the met-juli sentiments.
The Douglas Kid of the National Aeronautics Association (NSA) said it believes the treatment of the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said, there are only reports described by the pilot in support of being dealt with by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the Committee framed the fact that the F.A. Pilot allowed the fact that when the aircraft was launched in low visibility, they ordered the passengers to shut down the device.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and has said that they are a facility with general knowledge of the people who travel in the latest round of technology.
"We are delighted that the F.A.A. has recognized that travelling with pleasure is not inconsistent with passenger, rescue and safety," said Roger Do, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Learned from the Silsilewar bomb blasts in Patna, the UT police have taken the reins for a quick response to Diwali's distress and emergency situation in view of security.
A total of 1,800 soldiers will be deployed to all the main locations of the city, crowded markets and other places, to ensure the smooth running of the traffic system, to prevent incidents of arson, to teach other incidents, including to teach lessons to the monks.
These men will be accompanied by female police officers, including PCR, Traffic Units.
Police personnel and commandos will also scrutinise duty and tax records at other places, including hotels, guest houses and PG.
The police have directed the SHO to set up a Special Investment Team (SIT) to look into the cases.
In addition, DSP has been assigned responsibility to inspect markets, malls and other places, including the city's VIP sectors.
Due to the emergency situation and the festival of Diwali, senior officials have also imposed the duty of additional police personnel in police control in view of the welfare of the people.
Police have asked the Department of Defence and PGI Director, Principal Director and DHS to keep a high alert to the staff of other dispensaries in emergency times, in addition to the management of Sector-16 GMSH and Sector-32 GMCH.
The departmental officials have now put others, including female police personnel, under the leadership of the NGO, on duty to teach the lesson to the monks.
Anti-Gunda staff members of the police force will grab the manchals by standing in crowded places, including in plain clothes, in crowded markets.
All SHOs on Diwali have been ordered to put 44 nails in the inner areas of the city.
Police personnel will also be stationed at 38 Naka points along the city limits.
The bird was left back in the forest by air transport for protection from North C. Rig
The bird found on the North C Oil rig has been left behind by air transport to the forest from the coast.
This bird, named Water Rail, was sent to Aberdeen by a former helicopter, before being recovered by the Scottish SPCA at their Elo defence centre.
Union manager Colin Seddon said: "This water rail was probably the cold-weather passenger bird of northern Europe, which came into the clutches of high-speed winds above the North Sea."
It seems that the bird was tired and he took refuge on the oil rig.
He further said: "It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help."
Before leaving, the water rail had become healthy and tidy.
Is Europe's high class ready to do business with the UK?
In April, Business for Britain was launched and it was promised to bring the business together and determine what changes the U.K. wants to see in our relationship with the U.K.'s employment and prosperity manufacturer E.U.
For that, we conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought about the UK's business with the EU.
U-Gov took the view of 1000 business leaders, who are representatives of the UK's business size, areas and locations.
The results of this survey can be surprising to many people.
We found that a large part of businesses now want to export from outside Europe, and want to focus on those countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member countries are becoming inflexible.
They want the government to give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, not to interfere in the long-term and arduous process of reforming the EU's mysterious institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas, such as from monopolies regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that the control of these crucial skills should come back to the Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market could very easily be seen, the traders say that the price of regulation of Brussels is far more than the benefits of being part of the European commercial sector - even the giants who used to be in the traditional U.S.
In the end and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that, a large part clearly wants to move forward on the path of trade-based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the UK, the EU.
This finding, which was seen in the levels of major business groups, showed that businesspeople are driving a “relevant change” that would give the U.K. back its lost power.
It has a very high price - the issue of treaty change for the UK and getting a better deal changed by 16 percent in favour of staying in the EU in the vote-gathering.
The Prime Minister should not be in any doubt: it is the impossibility of the survey to support their plan to negotiate the terms of UK's membership in the UK, the EU.
It also pointed out that businessmen, expect to repeat the current balance of power by making a meaningful change in favor of the U.K..
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming mandatory very quickly, as the eurozone, the related economy and the fiscal union are taking a step forward.
Priority should be given to jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey findings show that this means for businesses to have a new focus on trade and a change based on the regulatory approach of Brussels.
Alexey Miller of Gazprom has announced the start of a new round of pipelines in Bulgaria
The head of Gazprom said that the construction of the South Stream Gas Pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the beginning of Europe's largest energy projects.
“Today there has been a historic event: the construction on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream Gas Pipeline has begun, which is the largest and most important project in Europe.” This is what Gasprom President Alexey Miller said on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream will provide diversity in Russia's export routes to Europe.
Officials said that, where Ukraine is the majority of Russia's gas for Europe, there is a risk of a dispute over the contract between Gazprom's counterpart and Gazprom's.
Miller said that a member of the European Union means a direct connection to Bulgaria, ending the "forever" of the old geopolitical risks associated with transit countries.
In 2015, after the operation of the entire project was disrupted, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at discounted rates from the South Stream.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline has been designed for the annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
F.A.A. is reducing restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on airplanes - though chatting on cell phones will still be prohibited.

The Royal Commission has heard allegations of sexual offences against two employees of YMCA before the charges against Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission said.
Before charges were brought against Caringbah Child Care Officer Jonathan Lord in the year 2011, two employees of YMCA N.S.W. have been convicted of child sexual offences.
But in a statement to the commission, it said it "never came up with a case of child sexual harassment within its organization," the commission said.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Greene was asked about the case in which an employee of YMCA was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which YMCA Karingbah Jim Ware was observed at YMCA in the year 1991 at the YMCA.
Gail Farnes, an advocate for the Commission, said he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also admitted that the statement of YMCA before the Commission that "the external investigation of YMCA has been conducted and he has found YMCA the most advanced in the matter of child protection" is not even accurate.
It is before the Commission that the YMCA was notified, and it received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Green, who is associated with YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the reason for appointing the Lord "self-involved" coercion has failed, and failed to ensure that the employees were informed of the alleged violations of the child protection policy.
At the beginning of this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences with 12 children during his two-year term in YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that there was a cultural problem in YMCA, due to which the employees did not report a child safety violation by Lord.
The employees gave the evidence of what they saw about the violation, in which Lord by spending time alone with the children, babysitting them in private, sitting them in the lap, telling them that he loves them and allowing them to play on their mobile phone.
Daniel Ocwell who was under the supervision of the Lord, and he had said for child safety training, because he was concerned about his conduct, testified that the Lord's superintendent was "Y.M.C.A. Karingbah at the time of the service of the Child Prohibitor".
The C.E.O. stated that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not easy to give information above their supervisor.
He said that, rather than his friendship with Lord, he misled his decision to give information about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had given his view to YMCA N.S.W. Mandal that the text for the organization from "Jonathan Lord incident" was "about not giving information".
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the confidentiality agreement by the employees immediately after the allegation came to light was made by YMCA's Child Services Commissioner, Liam Whitele.
He said that its purpose was to avoid the mixing of evidence, but it was not "extremely" and properly executed.
Prof. Stephen Smallbone, Special Professor of Child Sexual Exploitation at Griffith University, said that YMCA was not a safe organization during its tenure on the work of Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011.
He said there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, inspection, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been postponed to December 20.
Blair says they want to return to the UK.
Tony Blair said he would like the opportunity to become Britain's prime minister again - but he believes there is no possibility of a return.
In an interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation from the Prime Minister's office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007 after a decade as leader, most of his comments were limited to his role as a representative of foreign affairs and the peace founders of the Middle East group, and Mr. Blair did well beyond discussing British politics.
When asked if they would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair was presented by the London's EVENING STANDARD newspaper saying: "Yes, of course, but it is not likely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When a crowd of horse-performing experts gathered in Cardiff for the best horse of the year, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even going to school yet, and just a few months after taking his first step, this young child and his step-daughter, Tatoo Taffee of Shetland, easily completed three stages and received the top award - he left behind his 30 year-old rivals.
In the annual competition held by the Sunnyback Equestrian Center in Rudry near Cardiff, the inseparable pair - which is Sk's length - was greatly appreciated for their display, behavior and style.
In front of the handsome men and women wearing the baller hat, he rubbed his flat cap at a slight angle and shoved his two-year-old tofi into the ring.
The decision-makers praised Fenton for his natural ability to control which is far ahead of his age.
And Tofi got the highest score for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given a gift on her third birthday last March, and she has been practicing with this tattoo from Shetland ever since.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said: "Fantasy and Tofi are a great pair."
He had to face the challenge from all the candidates, but both of them won the Gold Cup and the Rosette.
This was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Tofi, and we are all very happy about his victory.
The most different in this landscape, he seemed so amazing to everyone that they wanted to take photos with him.
This little boy from the village of Natiglo, near Abwell, South Wales, is walking on the badges of his aunt Sharon Howells who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Mr. Howells said: "The whole place was filled with enthusiasm, and everyone was celebrating happiness and playing tali."
He was running on the hair in the entire color field, and even though he looked so small, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is the goddess of animals - she is very fond of horses, tractors and farms, and she has two kittens that she takes care of.
The way he started, he'll be in the best horse show of the year long ago - and I'm confident he'll perform very well.
The spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenten is only three years old, but he comes to control his tattoo."
They are very good couples.
The decision makers scored in terms of Fenton and Tofi's performance and the way they performed in the show ring.
He saw good team work between Tatsu and his rider - in this case Fenton and Tofi were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's beloved clothes have helped him, he was really looking very different.
The Chinese newspaper will be the "responsible"
A Chinese newspaper that had made an appeal on the front page to leave a reporter guilty of defamation, will be redone, a press analyst said.
Guangzhou's newspaper New Express had filed a virtual public suit for the release of journalist Chen Yongjou.
But after that, Mr. Chen admitted on television that, he had taken bribes to write a congratulatory report about the state-owned company.
Viniamak said the New Express now has to go through a "complete overhaul."
The order of "Suadhar" came from the GuangDong press and publications, radio, film and television administration.
"A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of the Yangcheng Evening News Group had printed a lot of fake news about listed company Yumloin between September 2012 and August 2013," the company said in a statement.
Viniamak said in a statement that "the editorial impasse of the New Express was unsatisfactory."
It said it had decided to "apply an administrative penalty by cancelling the license of Chen Yongjou's reporter."
"It had directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete overhaul of the New Express, to investigate the people responsible for it in the New Express and to immediately amend the leadership team of the New Express," he said.
Mr. Chen had written many articles in the New Express that blamed financial irregularities in a construction-equipment company called Jumloin.
Following his dismissal, his paper published two front-page appeals for his release, and said that he supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that, Mr. Chen came to state television and agreed to write and publish false stories for money.
"""In this case, I have harmed Jumloin as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win the trust of the people,"" he told state broadcaster CCTV."
I did it mainly because I had a crush on money and fame.
I am aware of my mistakes.
Following the apology of Mr. Chen, the New Express issued a front-page apology, in which it said that it had failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have filed a complaint against the T.V. for the alleged misappropriation.

U.S.-Mexico Drug Surgeon Finds Its Own Railways
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has been found, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. officials have described a four-feet-three-feet tunnel as one of the most complex secret routes ever discovered.
The tunnel is approximately equal to the steep-medium length of six football pitches, which connects Tijuana, Mexico near Godam and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is filled with domes like that, which makes it easy to hide the drug-filled truck.
Officials said it was shut down before a drug was passed through the tunnel.
According to the records of the Court, the authorities have seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine, in connection with the discovery of the tunnel.
Three persons, about whom the officials said they were acting as drivers, were accused of being kept Marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distributing them.
If convicted, he may be sentenced to 10 years from imprisonment to life imprisonment.
Taskar in Nogales, Arizona, benefits from vast underground water drains.
This tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since 2006.
In October, some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered after the Marijuana crop of central Mexico, which presents the challenge that drug mafia groups are able to challenge how they can quickly reach the product to consumers.
In 2010, officials found a route of about 700 gauges equipped with the rail track, which had spread from a Tijuana house's brewery to the San Diego Goddamms.

The British police have sent a notification to the Insanje.
British police today sent a release notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Equador embassy in London and has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it has sent a "return notice" to the 40-year-old Australian assailant, for which he will have to be present at the police station, as well as saying that he will be responsible for the arrest if he fails to do so.
While the Supreme Court had dismissed his appeal against the extradition earlier this month, he was facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual misconduct, as well as his choices under British law ended at the time when the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal against the extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm would refer him to the U.S., fearing that he would say to the South American country for political asylum, he had applied for asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19.
A spokesperson said that Scotland Yard "has sent a self-assignment notice to the 40-year-old assailant for which he was required to appear at the police station on the date and time chosen by us."
He is in violation of the terms of his bail.
The embassy refused to comment on the issue of police notice being given.
Assaj fears that due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. political cables on a privacy-opposite website called WikiLeaks, the United States will be handed over from Sweden to face possible espionage charges.
Penalty of <0xC2><0xA3>1000 for driving at a speed of 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between the legs
The driver has been fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 (<0xC2><0xA3>1,000) for driving at a speed of 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) by placing a hot drink between the legs.
Tiptry, 35-year-old Andrew Howie of Essex was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in the Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped them, they found a take-away drink on their feet.
In the Callchester Magistrate's Court, Howie has admitted the charge of driving in negligence.
Seven points have been added to his license, resulting in a six-month ban on driving a car.
Howie was also ordered to pay a 90-pound (<0xC2><0xA3>90) fee and a 100-pound (<0xC2><0xA3>100) victim surcharge.
Tax on foreign property owners will end London's artificial state of affairs
The Finance Department has provisionally calculated the CGT measures, but Mr. Osborne is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osbourne, who has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million in the 2012 budget, and a person who had invested in a private dwelling
In tax year 2012/13, the stamp duty received from residential properties in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea was <0xC2><0xA3>708 million, which was already received from Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North Yorkshire, and North Yorkshire.
Shri Kuk said, "After the introduction of the increase in the Stamp Duty of High-Value Houses and the Associated Anti-Avoidance Act, it is very difficult to argue that there is no less tax on the property of High-Value Houses than there is a fair amount of tax on the property of High-Value,

The scientists have shed further light on the relationship between the dog's tail movements and its mood.
Recent research has shown that happy dogs tend to shave their thumbs more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while unloved dogs tend to shave their tail more to the left.
But now scientists say that companion dogs can identify this subtle difference of tail and express their reaction to it.
The study has been published in the Journal of Current Biology.
Georgia Wellertigra, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: "People know all this well that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in a different way in the stimulation that is positive or negative."
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
Like humans, the right side of the brain in dogs was responsible for the actions of the left hand and the opposite order, and the two bullets played different roles in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to unilateral barking by other dogs, the researchers looked at animals when they saw other dogs' films.
He measured the heartbeats of the pet dogs and analyzed their behaviors.
We probably won't take much time to understand why their thumbs sometimes swing on one side and sometimes on the other.
Prof. Wellertigra said: "We introduced dogs with films of dogs - in the realistic version or in the shadow-picture to deal with other issues that put us in confusion. And we could have seen the action of the tail and we could have done more with the tail"
When the animals saw a stray dog barking to the right of its tail (from the dog's point of view), they were completely relaxed.
But when they saw the tail turning mainly to the left (again from the dog's point of view), their heart rate increased and they looked motionless.
According to Prof. Wellertigra, he did not think that dogs were communicating with each other knowingly through these actions.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from their experience what behavior they should be concerned about and not on which.
"If you've met several times with other dogs, and if they constantly shave their tail on one side, it's more about friendly behavior, and the right side presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience," he said.
The researchers say that these findings can provide better information to owners, veterinarians, and trainers about the feelings of the animals.
Visiting Fellow of the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, dog behavior expert John Bradshaw said this is not the first study to examine whether the left or right parts of the dog are not important for dogs.
Last year, the University of Lincoln team found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, they turn their head to the left and turn their head to the right when they see a happy dog.
In another study by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Unlike the Italian study - when the robot was tilted to the left rather than the right of the dog's tail, it was more likely to get closer to the dog than to be homeless."
This difference was due to the fact that in various studies, the animals or robot dogs in the dog films were not completely white, he said.
He clarified that the study of the way dogs react to real dogs can help in this.
"While there is ample evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still to be obtained - and dogs are no exception in this case," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that it will probably not take us much time to understand why their thumb sometimes swings on one side and sometimes on the other.
Alex Turner's disease caused by Arctic mangroves has delayed Glasgo Gig
The rock bank, called Arctic Monkeys, has suspended the gig in Glasgow after suffering from the slump of its lead singer.
On Friday, the Sheffield group's programme was set to perform at the hydro site in the city.
But his lead singer Alex Turner's illness forced him to reschedule the date of the show.
The band's announcement came at a time when they were forced to suspend the gig at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: After taking medical advice tonight, after deciding to postpone the show at the Burmindham LG Arena, Arctic Monkeys will also be in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st.
"Alex Turner was found strangled in the test, and they are sadly unable to perform."
The show will be held in the LG Arena in Birmingham on November 20, and the show will be held in Glasgow Hydro on November 21.
All tickets will be valid for this show.
We apologize for any inconvenience that may be caused to all ticket holders.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February.
The Vatican has announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will make a new Cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his lifetime on February 22.
Cardinals, the Catholic Church, have the highest rankings, their position is only below the pope, and these are the people who choose the pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his individuals, who will ultimately help to elect their successors.
There are a total of 201 cardinals.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the election of the pope - it comes in the group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the New Cardinals' promotion ceremony, a meeting of all the existing Cardinals will be held, which is called the Pope's Assembly.
"Pope Francis has decided to make his decision to hold the February Pope-Council in advance, so that it will be easier to plan other meetings involving Cardinals from different countries of the world," he said.
Jack Valero, of Catholic Voices, said that by February the number of cardinal electors was likely to decline.
He said that the Pope generally declares the number of cardinal electors as low as 120, as the cardinals, and as they wish, the names of cardinals over 80 years of age.
Valero said that next year's Pope's Assembly will be important, as it will be the first Pope's Assembly after France's election in March this year.
At present, there is a kind of bias towards Europe and, in particular, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new popes, even cardinals from the rest of the world, can re-establish the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but their number in the Cardinals is very low.
The Cardinals Council by Francis - which is a group of eight cardinals from around the world, whose work is to seek ways of reforming the church, will also be the first cardinals to be elected after being formed.
Before that, the Pope had made all the decisions of his own.
Valero said, "Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him."
He said it is "possible" that Francis would seek advice from the Cardinals.
But we’re not in this situation before – it’s completely new.
Valero said that the pope usually gives the bishop of large places the post of cardinal, but Francis "was quite surprised - so we don't know whose name they're going to declare."
G.M. called pickup trucks back in the U.S. to fix seatbacks
General Motors Company, its all-new 2014 Shevarle Silverado and GMC Sira Pickup Trucks has a 19-thirty-thirty-thirty-thirty-thirty-thirty-thirty-thirty-thirty-thirty-thirty-t-thirty-t-thirty-t-t-thirty-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-
In some trucks, there may be a decrease in the front seat rotation system.
As a result, the seatback failed to comply with Union Auto Safety Standards regarding the head restraints.
According to a statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website, "If the vehicle is stuck from the back, it is possible that the head restroom, the driver could not be properly protected, which would increase the risk of injury."
The recalled models were built between 1st August to 10th September.
G.M.'s truck began shipping in June and, following the 2009 Diwali innovation, it showcases the most important Vohan launch for top U.S. automakers.
G.M. had informed the truck owners of the offence in the aftermath of October.
N.S.T.M.A.'s 16-day government ban, which had hampered the increase in auto sales in October, could not review the owner's notification letter.
G.M. said on Friday that, in the sale of silverado and sera trucks that were redesigned for the 2014 model year, there was a 20 per cent increase in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, G.M. sold 42,660 silverados and 16,503 sera pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, there was a 1.4 per cent surge in G.M.'s shares in the New York Stock Exchange.
The Disappointment of Obama's Voters
I voted for Obama twice in anticipation of a change.
Obama's great effort has been hampered due to the policy of blocking the GOP, he said.
Obamacare's policy of deterrence can't rule out drone attacks, Obamacare website's woes
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir reminds us of what could have been.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books today.
It’s a book that I think will boost my enthusiasm during the second year of the Medical School’s vindication and spark the spark of hope in me.
Its name is "The Courage to Win", and it is a memorial to Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election campaign.
When I get bored with my patients’ beds at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a time when politics had inspired millions of people and speech could have stopped your breathing.
The elections proved to be one-sided, and the press had paused to show the historical significance of the time.
In the eyes of my compatriots there were tears of joy, and my parents kept the news letter that each one of them received.
A group of young visionaries were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
In 2008, he had an approval rating of 82 per cent while becoming President of Obama.
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from the dream world.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to remember a distant, a sad memory of missed opportunities.
It was the first time that I had actually changed my mind after the election.
To put it simply, none of this could have been imagined.
I commend Obama for his many accomplishments, from the Affordable Care Act to the return of our army from Iraq, to the end of "don't ask" and the death of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that the policy of opposing the party has prevented many efforts of our country to move forward: including immigration reform, public options for health services, closure of ports on Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But the countless times that I have sided with the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, I have the answers that I can give them.
I have reached the point of political disillusionment.
The anti-republican policy is not the answer to spying on foreign leaders, nor is it the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency's collection of data about the private lives of ordinary American citizens nor can it respond to the prosecution of those who expose the wrong actions of the government.
It cannot explain the cause of the murder of a U.S. citizen, Anwar L. Awlaki, without trial, nor was there a shortage of public funds and spending limits during the presidential campaign.
This cannot answer the findings of that report, which states that efforts to silence the media by the White House "have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration so far."
And most recently, it cannot excuse the failure to design a simple website even after three years of being signed into the law of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know what I was expecting.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the system of government, can be a stumbling block to the political campaign that is bringing it forward.
It is clear that the elected office is not a predictable path, as the opposition political party and random events such as the Newtown Massacre will give shape to our public discussion.
Yet as many of the examples I have given above, they seem to be mostly self-chosen by the administration.
This is what bothers you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012 but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romani presented a misleading and uncertain alternative, which did not seem to define his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we have been hearing about for a long time.
Yet, while Obama's approval rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return to 2008 through that book.
When I look at him, I remember his words.
A portion of the book was being read this week, describing how Clinton suffered a lot of damage due to Obama in the Pennsylvania primaries.
At a post-martial campaign meeting, he told his subordinates that they need to get back on track, and stay true to their goals.
He said, "I want to get my mojo back."
We need to remember who we are."
Today, five years from now, Mr. President, I can no longer agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris.
P.M. Tony Abbott's interest in the paternity leave scheme is a struggle
"""Prime Minister Tony Abbott's interest in the paternity leave scheme is a struggle because his daughters may become pregnant, and they may take advantage of it,"" said MP Clive Pamer."
The mining sector's Maharthi, who is in dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed, while he has tried to answer questions about the conflict.
The U.S. Congress can control up to four votes in the U.S. Senate, which could be crucial in determining whether carbon and mining taxes will be cut.
But Mr. Pamer has claimed that only the interests of ministers can be a struggle, and said that Mr. Abbot's daughters can personally benefit from the policies.
"He may have an important interest in the case of maternity leave, because if any of his daughters are pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not they got the leave."
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Pamar the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes.
Mr. Pamer called for the survival of electoral counting to advance the process at a rapid pace.
The daughters of Tony Aut are Frances and Bridget.
Should the result of the election come after two months of being voted by us?
"We should have a better system,"" he said."
Why can't we have a system in which we fill out our returns on the computer, vote immediately and we have results at 6:30 p.m.
Mr. Pamer also criticised the use of pencils to mark the ballots.
That's because if a person doesn't like him, who can erase him?
It's not easy to use a pencil in today's time.
The Election Commission (EC) is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint consultation letter with New Zealand.
59-year-old M. Pamer said his policies include the creation of an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and that he is "very serious" about his new job.
The public office is for public service.
"We don't need any other award other than the award of history that we can serve the community at this crucial time,"" he said."
This caused problems for the plaintiffs.
Addressing the meeting on the occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed strong emphasis on the deteriorating law and order in the state.
The growing attacks on the lawyers and their families prove that the criminals have gone insane, he said.
There is no fear of the police and the administrative system.
Referring to recent incidents in different places, he said that when the advocate is not safe society, the safety of the common man can easily be assumed.
RBS has cancelled two forex traders.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two people from the know-how of the case have received this information, another sign that the currency market has been rigged by the scammers in the suspected scammer.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barcel<0xC3><0xB3>, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with lenders in an investigation into the world's largest financial market with an exchange of $5.3 trillion every day.
The two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended as the investigation into the case, which appears to be a repeat of the Libor Interbank loan Heerfer kand, has been moved forward.
The bank has refused to comment on Nilumban, confirming that the bank has received a request for information from lenders this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank had said, "Our investigation is ongoing in this case, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other creditors."
Last month, the expert in the case had said that RBS had sent the former trader and sent the records of emails and instant messages received from them to the UK’s prudent, financial regulator.
This trader named Richard Usher left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been released from his current post of European head of forex spot trading in J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of European spot trading in the city, was on holiday last week, while the former senior keranci trader at Barkley and UBS was sacked by Standard Chartered this week.
No wrongful act has been charged against any of these traders.
The experts in the case said that the instant message group of Mr. Youshar includes Barcles and Bankers of the Sitigrup.
UBS said that, after being told by Swiss Vinayamak, Finama that he is investigating the suspected herpheric of the foreign exchange market in many Swiss backs, this week he has taken action against some of his employees.
Globally, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, the Competition Authority of Switzerland, the VCO, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - have been mobilizing their favorable leverage in the currency market on the banks.
The people familiar with the case said that HSBC, City Group, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or received requests for information from the creditors.
The bank is looking for a clue to a misbehavior for several years to check the exact same amount of instant messages and emails.
The news about the investigation-traffic has sparked controversy among traders in the area, who have been among the top earners in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but have faced the challenge this year because of the low volatility
Some bankers have tried to push the case by saying that it is impossible to erfe in the very large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say it is not necessary that it be true.
The senior trader said that despite the huge size of foreign exchange buy-sell, the liquidity gap between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of its own platform by banks could mean "you can make a little less" on the market
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse had announced that the trader would be serviced this week from its Exchange Traded Funds Desk in London, which had lost about $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its lenders in the matter.
Credit Suisse said, "We are confident that the trader had acted alone, and that he has been controlled."

Dhanteras has made a lot of purchases of gold and silver from bartenders in the capital.
Such purchases have increased by 20 to 30 per cent over the previous year.
The shops in Shimla were stocking up on the stalls.
A large crowd was also seen in the shops of bartenders ranging from the lower market to Mallrod.
While this year was taking a toll on such items, people still did not seem inclined to buy them on a good note.
Good luck for shopping on Friday from 7:52 am to 10:12 am and 1:56 am to 3:37 pm and 6:17 am to 8:12 pm.
At the time of the said three muharat, more crowds of people in the suburbs, including Shimla, flocked for more shopping.
In the Shimla Lower market, there was no place for people to stand.
The same was true for every small shop.
In such a case, the purchase on Dhanteras, which is celebrated as the Triadshi Dhantrayodshi of the Krishna Party of Kartik Mas, is a sign of good diwali.
The Supreme Court has upheld Obama's health care law.
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the Health Services Act in the name of Barack Obama constitutionally.
With 5-4 votes cast, the judges decided in favour of the separate order of the Patient Safety and Affordable Care Act - under which citizens would be required to purchase or punish health insurance before the year 2014. The judge ruled that it was impugned by the government to charge the tax

The petition was brought by 26 States, and the National Independent Business Federation, to block the law.
During the initial session of 2012, the law was opposed by all the major Republican presidential candidates, including the project nominee Mitt Rumani.
It is true that our work cannot go on without money.
Money is one of the greatest needs for life savings, but it is not in our interest to accept it all.
We are celebrating Krishna Triodshi of Kartik month.
Dhanteras is worshipped by the goddess of wealth Kuber and the god of death Yamraj.
Money is an important place in our lives and our lives.
No money is good or bad.
Our sense of well-being is our sense of well-being.
There can be no other thing more valuable than the work of the welfare of mankind, but it makes no sense at all what caused the devastation of money.
We make money with a sacred purpose and spend it with a sacred purpose.
It is the duty of every person to make money for the maintenance of the family.
Some parts of it should also have a sense of spending on society, but the tendency to make useless storage or one-on-one-disposal money destroys our consciousness, our personality.
The spirit of donation should always be in the mind.
A portion of the money you give can also be the basis of someone's life savings.
We all need to think about how many people in society are living in terrible shortages.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and moksha have been given equal importance in the men of life.
Everyone wishes for wealth and success, and they also get wealth and success according to their mantra.
The same wealth is sustainable with which respect is attached.
No matter how rich a criminal may become, he can neither properly consume it nor the work of anyone else.
Don't waste your money on someone else.
The true rich man is the one who makes the way to flow into the countless hands of the rich.
There can be no one else's use of money more than creating jobs for others.
Money, on the other hand, is not just a currency.
It was also like your health, your character, your love for others.
Try to be the owner of that money.

NEW DELHI: BJP Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of Dinanath Mangeshkar Hospital, attacked the Congress on Friday by addressing an election rally.
"""Sometimes the coalition government was formed in several states and centres of the country, sometimes the Congress government was formed, sometimes the Communist government was formed by the BJP."
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call on the country's political pundits, economists.
There are certain parameters in the country.
What the team did.
If this results in a comparative outcome, it will not be a question before the country whether the BJP government should come or not.
There has been an effort to meet the aspirations of the people when and where the BJP government has been formed.
This country witnessed low prices in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man had to eat twice.
But when the Congress-backed government was formed, the poor man could not get enough food.
Not a single Congress leader, not a single UPA leader, is responding to what they have done in nine and a half years.
Even the media in our country can't reach them.
The Congress has been outraged.
They don't even respond to the media.
The election is for the Lok Sabha, you answer the people.
"""We are going to ask questions from Modi in the coming days. In 2014, when the people will bless the BJP, they will present their work in front of the people every year,"" he said."
In a democracy, not a ruler in Delhi, but a servant should sit.
There can be no nat in Delhi, there should only be slaves.

In a democracy, the people take the lead.
A case has been registered against Google, Sasmang, Huwai in the case of Northtel Patent.
The group, which is owned by thousands of former Northale Patents, has filed many patent lawsuits against Google, including the cell phone manufacturers, which it had smuggled into the Northale Diwalian auction on Thursday.
SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO. LIMITED, H.T.C. CORPORATION, H.C. CORPORATION, HUVAI, etc., for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
The Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, Blackberry, Erection and Sony.
Google has been accused of violating seven patents on the Internet.
The suit said that these patents also include technology that combines the words being searched on the Internet with the words that are related to advertising, which is the main part of Google's search business.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC make all of these phones, which run on Google's Android operating system, which is in stark contrast to Apple's and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for the Northtel Patents.
Google finally offered $4.4 billion in bids, adding several times to the bid.
After losing to the Rockstar in the Northtel Patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons why Motorola had to have a long list of patents.
"Despite losing in an attempt to acquire patents-in-suits in the country, Google has violated, and is continuously violating," the prosecution said.
Rockstar has sought increased compensation against Google, as it is alleged that the violation of patents by Google is a misdemeanour.
Egypt's first president to be elected independently in Egypt
Mohammed Morsi has taken his oath of office, but his victory day in Egypt has hardly been able to end the political struggle.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised "New Egypt" while taking the oath of office as the country's first independently elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was removed 16 months ago.
On their formal establishment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi has become the world's first freely elected Islamist president, and Egypt's fifth president after the removal of the government nearly 60 years ago.
He took an oath on his chair in front of 18 judges with black robes of the court on the banks of the Nile River, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
During the formal ceremony shown in live broadcast on national television, Morsi said, "We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic."
The hard-line group Muslim Brotherhood, who has served as an illegal declared organization for 84 years since its inception, and who has been under the banner of previous governments, has been trained in the U.S.S.S.S.S.A. engineer Swathani and 60-year-old Nej Myce
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers secured the building and, according to local time, Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m.
Since the time of Mubarak, only a few hundred supporters have gathered outside the court to congratulate the new President apart from the President's dhumdham. The traffic was also stopped for a short time, so that their motorcade is normally occupied by the city of Jokhar, which is occupied by the city of Jokhar.
The non-Christians of Bradarhud, who are being hailed as "empty tires", have grown a lot in the personal reputation of Morsi after his victory and on Friday his speech made him not only an Islamist but a candidate of all those who wished to attend Kewrath, Kewrath.
Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, took the oath of office in front of judges sitting in a wooden paneled room, saying, "Today, Egypt is a citizen, a national, a constitutional and a modern nation."
He then went to Morsi Cairo University, where he had to give his inaugural speech.
The military band played the national tune and were officially welcomed while they were standing in the currency of caution.
Army Governor Field Marshal Hussain Tantavi was also present.
Upon their arrival, hundreds of people present in the lecture room at the main university welcomed with the slogan that "the army and the people are one hand".
Founded in 1908 as the cradle of secular education, the University of Cairo later became the cradle of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in the Tahrir Square, which is the starting point of the revolution, which ended last year's reign of Mubarak, and the president who was removed from his post by the military council last year.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court instead of taking an empowered oath of Parliament, they bow to the will of the army, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in the Teheri Square was filled with dramatic popular currencies.

Meanwhile, an important committee of the U.S. Parliament has approved a bill restricting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
Its goal is to make the monitoring more transparent and restore the trust in people that has been hurt by the disclosure of large-scale phone tapes.
Six U.S. companies, including Google, Yahoo, have welcomed the move by the Senate.
The NSA has also launched a probe into the data centers of these companies.
The Senate's power committee passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill (FISA) on Friday by 4 votes to 11 in favor of the NSA.
The bill mentions a number of restrictions, including a ban on tapeting a mixed phone under the U.S. Patriot Act.
Under the FISA, knowingly collecting data illegally would be considered a criminal offence and a ten-year prison sentence has been prescribed for this purpose.
The bill will become law after both the Congress houses have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The committee's chairman and senator Diane Festin said the program of recording the NSA's phone is under the law and I believe it has made an important contribution to the security of the country.
But in spite of this, more transparency should be brought into it.
No, the protection of the privacy of the public should also be taken into account.
Meanwhile, the bill has been backed by angry Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL, and Facebook since the unveiling of the NSA's Internet Monitoring Program.
In a letter to the senators, these companies have said that we welcome the proposal of the MPs who are conspiring to record the phone on a large scale of the NSA.
It is worth noting that the documents issued by former CIA employee Edward Snowden removed the veil from the NSA's doings.
The international community is deeply outraged by the announcement of a telephone monitoring of the talks of the presidents of 35 countries, including Germany and France by the NSA.

So you thought the travel agent was from the last century, thank you to the internet?
The flight center is moving forward with this move.
The company has increased its full-year profit forecast, and is expecting a record profit from the holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company is expected to have a pre-tax profit of between $325 million and $340 million before the full year, while in the previous forecast it was reported to be between $305 million and $315 million.
If the target is achieved as per the current guidance, it will be an increase of 12 to 17 per cent in the record gains of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
Prohibited Director Graham Turner said that the Flight Center has made 8 per cent profit in the first half of the first half, and has made a good start in its second half, particularly on non-business trips to Australia and the U.K.
"So far, our 10 countries are in profit, and many countries, interest and tax contributions are on track for a full-year record of full-year income," he said.
It includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually our most profitable centers, which are the most profitable of all.

A recent media report said the NSA had flown information from Yahoo and Google's data centers for spying.
The Washington Post has revealed this on the basis of documents collected from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who is also a member of the NSA.
According to the report, the NSA was the name-masculer of the program, which he ran together with his British counter-part-GCHQ.
The two agencies stole data from Yahoo and Google's vast fiber optic cable network in the wake of the crash.
The Washington Post has said in a top secret document dated January 9, 2013 that more than 18 crore documents were collected in just three days from the start of the program.
These include e-mail, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run outside of the United States and a Benami telecoms provider helped NSA to gain access to this information.
According to the newspaper, it was much easier for NSA to run the program outside the US, as court orders are required for such campaigns in the US.
NSA chief general Keith Alexander denied the allegations during a press conference in Washington, D.C., saying, "As far as my information is concerned, this has never happened.
The NSA has always collected all the information within the scope of the law.
The NSA had recently been targeted for spying on the German chancellor.
The U.N. on Wednesday said the U.S. administration has assured that its communications system will not be monitored.
The United States has also said that the United Nations communication system is not monitored.

The schools have taken the initiative to pay more attention to math, spelling and grammar.
In English literature courses, students will have to read at least one Shakespearean play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and a contemporary British story after 1914.
To encourage more reading, the exam will also include "unseen text" in the exam.
A joint English literature and language course will be completed.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to take a separate GCSE in the language, and will have a lot of motivation to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new course for English and Mathematics tomorrow - these will be the first two topics in which there will be revolutionary change.
It will also change in other major issues next year.
In a separate step, the exam will demonstrate changes in the structure of the G.C.S.E. along with a new grading system, the curriculum.
Speaking in the heat, Education Secretary Michael Gov had said that "there was a lot more consensus about it, we need to improve our own examination system to restore people's confidence", he said, adding that GCSE "will be more challenging, more ambitious and more ambitious".
Studies have found that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year or - 3 hours less per week during the session than most countries do.
According to the comparison, Australian schools provide students with an average of 143 hours per year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While, there would be no formal need to give more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that the wider mathematics G.C.S.E. - encouraged to provide additional education in schools by being combined for more weight with subjects in the league table.
This course will focus more on the "problems of the real world" including financial mathematics.
The Supreme Court has refused to stop the media reporting.
The Supreme Court said it could not tell the media not to report the information received from the police or any other source.
Asaram's lawyer said Asaram is being referred to as Dracula in the case.
There is a guide line for reporting in this case but it is not being followed.
On this, the Supreme Court said that you have many more treatments that can be used.
Asaram's lawyer said there are thousands of news papers and 100 news channels across the country, but there are two channels in particular that cause them more trouble.
These people are de-damaging their image and are reporting unilaterally.
In this case, the right to privacy should be protected.
The court refused to stop the media from reporting, but told Asaram's lawyer that he had other legal remedies that he could use.
Pawan Bansal, surrounded by opposition questions at the railway gate, put the opposition in a position to say that he had not seen a woman in 15 years.
After that, everyone was surprised where the woman’s story came from.
Perhaps the sign of Bansal was on the side of a great BJP leader and a Pashtun's domestic relations.
Turning the case to the other side, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had conspired to charge a woman behind him during the last parliamentary election, which was not successful.
In an interview with reporters, Bansal said that the CBI had interrogated him in Rail Rishwat.
If they were made a witness in the case, would it have been made only after the full investigation?
Bansal said that he had written a letter to only one needy person in the booth scam that he was talking about.
If this is their fault, they will always do so.
He said that although there was no constitutional right to raise the issue in the Corporation House, he asked the opposition to speak for itself.
As long as it is a matter of telling about the development work, the opposition will be given a list of 15 years of development work.
The way Chandigarh is developing or going to be, these people can't even think there.
At the meeting of the Cabinet, there was an exchange of greetings between the two.
At the end of the meeting, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for responding to the attack on Narendra Modi in the Chintan camp.
Speaking about his speech, he also said that he has no other feeling in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges need to be tackled.
It was also on the face of the Chief Minister that he took Singh's speech in a positive way.
Singh had urged the Chief Minister to respect the workers in the Chintan camp and protect them from the alleged harassment of the officers.
However, they had also said that they are also ready for dismissal from the Cabinet to hold their talk.
By the way, after the opinion arose in the think-tank camp, there is a fresh spirit of thought in the case of placing the workers on government posts.
The JD(U) president Vashishth Narayan Singh had said that the appointment of the workers in the 20 Sutri committees would be announced soon.
His sign was also that the list was almost ready.
The news is that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will make the list from his own level.
They will also look into whether the MLAs- MPs have taken the view in making the list.
If necessary, the old and committed workers will be reassigned on a large scale in the list to make room for them.
It is a common allegation of legislators-members that the opinion of those persons was not taken in making the list of nominations.
The names of the people who came from other parties much later have been included in the list while many of the important activists who have been active since the days of the Samata Party have remained neglected.
Some people are born with silver sponges and some make life ideal from their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One of the names of such personalities comes from S. Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, was born on 28 December 1932 in a small village in Chorwad, Gujarat.
Dhirubhai was the third of five brothers and sisters.
The five children of the family include Ramanikalal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumati.
Dhirubhai had to leave school only after high school due to economic turmoil.
Dhirubhai had started providing financial assistance to the house as a child.
At this time they were laying shops near Girnar, the revenue of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Speaking of Dhirubhai's first job, he had arrived in Yemen in 1949 from a 17-year-old ship called Kabota.
Here his older brother Ramanikalal had made all arrangements for him, so he had no trouble getting a job abroad.
But there was something else going on in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954 they returned to Vatan.
In 1955, the couple reached Mumbai, where they put 500 rupees in their pocket.
This is where his professional career began.
Dhirubhai Ambani stepped up from here and never looked back again.
His name is known not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani resigned from the world on July 6, 2002.
At the time, he was the owner of Rs 62000 crore.
His sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are currently in charge of his kingdom.
Like the father, the names of these two brothers today are also common in international businesses.
Who doesn't know about the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

JAGRAN BURO, Srinagar: The security of former minister Ghulam Hasan Khan, who was a member of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Congress, has reportedly been removed by the police.
"Khan said his security has been removed for political reasons,"" the state government said in a statement."
It is stated that Ghulam Hasan Khan, who won the election in 2002 on the PDP ticket from Shopian, was part of his Cabinet while Mufti Muhammad Said was the Chief Minister.
"Ghulam Hasan Khan said, ""I've had security clearance since 1996."""
I live in so-called "terrorist" shops.
A security detail of the CRPF at my house was placed under the lead of all inspectors.
I also have a guard with me, but all my security was taken back on Friday.
When the security guard was leaving my house, I spoke to the district deputy commissioner and district SP.
But instead of restoring security, he said only that he would investigate the matter.
In this context, when contacted by the IGP of Kashmir Abdul Ghani Mir, he denied the information of the case, saying it was a sensitive matter.
I will examine for myself how the security of a former minister and a senior political leader has finally been removed.
"""There is nothing like this in my information,"" Saifudin Soj, head of the state Congress, told PTI."
This is a very serious matter if the security of Hasan Khan has been agreed.
I am currently in Jammu and Kashmir for the next two days.
I will discuss this issue with the relevant administration.
According to the report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore over the past four years to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
Instead, in contrast to Modi's claims, during the reign of the NDA (between 1999 and 2004) during the tenure of the Prime Minister of Atal Vihari Bajpayee, no advertisement was issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
While holding the base of Sardar Patel's 182-metre-high statue of 'Stachu of Unity' in Kevadia of Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "There was no advertising on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary earlier.
While the records of the DAVP indicate that UPA spent Rs.4.10 crore in 2009-10, Rs.4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs.2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs.1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's ads.
When asked by Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Manish Tiwari about Modi's claims, he said that the BJP does not speak on the basis of PM candidate facts.
The UPA did not find any ads on Patel in 2008.
Tiwari said this happened because of the economic slowdown that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much lower each year than the amount spent on births and funerals of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family.
The DAVP spent Rs 33 crore for Mahatma Gandhi's birth and funeral, Rs 21 crore for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru.
When Manish Tiwari was asked about this difference, he said, "It should not be seen from the perspective of spending on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including the size of the advertising or the rate of advertising for that year etc.
The reality is that this shows our dedication, which the people who oppose are trying to take on the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.
Today he will meet the families of the people killed at the Patna rally last Sunday.

The police will look at the people who will attend the meetings.
Gujarat Police Force, NSGIB and State Police Security will keep an eye on the matter.
The security of Modi will be tightened and tightened.
Meanwhile, questions have also been raised about the BJP's ongoing visit to Kalsh, which has been taken away from the people killed in the Patna terror attack.
Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been accused of disrupting the BJP environment.
To move forward from land, rivers and forests to provide free medical services to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Wells is providing free health services in rural areas of Cameroon.
Wells and his team see hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
There are not many doctors in West African countries; for 5,000 people there is only one doctor.
Give your vote here or give it via mobile.
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of C.N. in the year 2013.
You can vote for them or for someone in the other top 10 to make C.N.N. the hero of the year.
The winning person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Welle had come to his sick father's senses and being unconscious, had been seen going to the hospital, which was not adequately equipped to assist them.
Jamel Well was injured in a car accident in 1981 near the capital of Cameroon, Yonde.
At first his only hand was broken, but an infection increased that spread to his brain, and he produced cancerous tumors, which affected the rest of his life.
Georges Welle says, "There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon."
If we had money, we would take our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Wells was being bullied by overcrowded clinics and hospitals about his father and receiving whatever treatment he could get.
Well said, "It's not easy."
You leave the house at 5 a.m. with the expectation that you will be the first person to arrive at the hospital, but that will not happen.
There are a lot of patients there.
Some people wait - sometimes they can end up in the mouth of death.
There has not been much change in the situation since the death of Wells' father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
By comparison, there is a doctor for every 413 people in the United States.
And even if there are doctors there, many residents of Cameroon can’t bear his expenses.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the spending on health services in the country is in the private sector.
Wells says, "His only problem is poverty."
And because they're poor, they can't enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his countrymen, Well made a firm decision to resolve it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have treated 700 free-of-charge fees in the past year.
They also became doctors themselves, and began working as a vasculature surgeon at Yonde's Center Hospital.
And they started the non-profit organization Escoway, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and a group of his volunteers have assisted around 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday they and up to 30 people sit in the van, take medical supplies from the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical care.
Sometimes they don't even get along with them.
They have to push the vehicle more than once out of the rivers and soil.
But when they arrive, they really get the honor of heroes: dancing, singing and dancing, and the best housing that can be offered by the community.
Free medical services in these villages are a real cause of celebration, and the well - with its big smile and endless energy - includes happiness.
The next morning, his team starts to meet hundreds of patients.
Wel said, "We are meeting 500 people on each trip."
They come about 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekends clinics offer different types of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other people may get a scholarship, donated glasses, or free birth certificate -- this document is required in school but many poor families can't afford it.
In the evening, the team performs a simple pay-treatment with local memorabilia.
The operation is usually performed at the school building, town hall or home; after the procedure, the patient goes to the recovery site, and makes room for the next person.
The group's generator operates in a room with operations and publishes sanitizing equipment, and Wells and his volunteers wake up early on Sunday morning to work.
It's a slow pace, but the musicians of the village usually help keep the band motivated.
Wel said, "They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work."
On Sunday, their team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group – which includes Cameroon’s doctors and foreign medical students – has treated 700 free of charge last year, and they know that their help can change the world of the people they help.

In addition to running a weekend clinic and working as a salary-doctor at the hospital, Well also works in a private medical clinic around the yawnede at night.
This is his second job, which finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is filled with private donations, he said.
Drexel University's second-year medical student and volunteer in the Wells group in Philadelphia, Cathy O'Malley said, "I don't know when they're sleeping."
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization, so that they keep running these campaigns.
Medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join the Well's campaign, this is an experiential opportunity for them, which they can never get in their own country.
"In the award-winning medicine we help to hold the tools for Dr. Wells or clean the blood clots, in which we are able to gain experiential experience," O'Malley said.
As a second-year medical student in the United States, you will never get the opportunity to do so.
Voluntary students usually spend on their own to reach out to Cameroon, and they often come up with donation medical supplies.
But after reaching Yawnde, they come and go, and the cost of the instructions is well worth the stay.
O'Malley says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never going to end.
For a well, almost the same workload, is not a difficulty.
Helping other people live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are the things that give them a lot of joy.
Well says, "I'm very happy to do this job."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, reduce their pain.

In an unexpected acceptance, John Kerry said the U.S. spy "has gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry has hinted at the U.S.'s protective stance on its surveillance program by accepting this unanticipated form that sometimes its surveillance "misfitly goes a long way forward."
The State Minister has also admitted that he is also guilty of being on "automated pilot" with Barack Obama in the case of the informant, Edward Snowden, about coming face to face with the NSA's spying activities.
This unconstitutional act has brought the U.S. government to a diplomatic ground in relation to its allied countries.
Speaking through video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Shri Carey said: "There is no question that the President, me, and others in the Government really knew about some of the things that happened with the automatic pilot, because in the second century, and then again, the Second World War.
They have become the first high-ranking members of the U.S. government, who have admitted that U.S. spying has extended its range, but have stressed that no one's rights have been abused.
He said, "In some cases, it has gone unduly far ahead."
And the President is firmly committed to trying to make this clear to the people and is currently conducting a thorough review so as not to cause abuse in any person.
I assure you that nothing is going wrong with innocent people in this process.
Shri Carey stressed that, however, N.S.A. was striving for a good cause, and its monitoring work has saved the lives of many people.
"We are facing a world where people are ready to fly themselves,"" he said."
There is a brutal aggression in the world that is committed to killing people alive and to blowing them up and attacking governments.
So what's the problem if you're able to stop it before it happens?
We’ve saved the plane from actually falling, buildings being destroyed, and people being killed because we’ve been able to already know about other people’s plans.
During this time, the President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday said that the so-called U.S. spying will go to the U.S. legislators from the U.S. to the U.S. to help resolve the concerns abroad, and the European countries will go to the U.S. to the U.S.-R.
Contact Senator Chris Murphy said he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and other people this week and has been caught up in the threats of being stopped by anti-terrorism organizations due to surveillance by the National Security Agency (NSA).
In an interview with Washington, the president of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, Murphy, who was elected for the first time by the Democratic Party, said, "It's really important for the U.S. national security interests that our terrorism-anti-Semitism prevails."
To make it clear to European countries that we need to work together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger over the NSA programme.
The news of recording millions of European phone conversations by the NSA has brought a cut in relations with some U.S. allied countries, although the head of the agency said that these reports are not entirely correct, and Nato allied with the United Nations
Other disclosures in the documents leaked by Snowden indicate that the NSA has been monitoring the cell phones of 34 other top leaders of the world, including the German Chancellor's Agency Markle.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper, defending the incident of spying on allied countries, said it was necessary and said it was common practice for both sides to do so.
In the midst of the scandal, Murphy said his office is arranging a Congress trip that is likely to take place this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include both parties and members of both chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators will be released in the coming days.
He said that the travel programme is still being worked on.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to make relationships better, he said that some "unusual relationships" would also have to be abandoned.
He said that European leaders, along with their people, will also have to be loyal to their spying programs that have been used for years.
"While we can modify our surveillance program to better protect the rights of the European people, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said.
During this weekend, there is a programme to go to the Middle East and Poland of Shri Carey, where he will resolve the dispute over U.S. surveillance activities in Syria, Egypt and Iran from the U.S. strategy.
A new policy of changing the board in the municipalities has begun.
Recently, Trinamool became the board due to the change of the party of the Congress-led board of trustees in the Sawahathiya township of Virbhum district.
The change took place due to the fact that most of the Congress, including the chairman of the Municipal Corporation, joined the Trinamool of the Pashtuns.
Not only the Congress but also some of the MPs of the Makpa, Bhakpa and Farvard Block have taken the stand of Trinamool here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Rai considers it a good sign for the party.
He said that Saahuthiya Municipal Corporation Chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplov Dutta were among the 10 Pashtun Trinamools of the Congress.
Some left-wingers, including Makpa, have also flagged Trinamool.
All have informed the district authority under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of Trinamool and as per the number of forces, the Sahahatiya Municipal Board has also come under control of Trinamool.
Shri Rai also contends that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is in agreement with all of Bengal's decisions on development.
The leaders of the other parties, including the Congress, Makpa, Bhakpa, and Farvard Block, are moving forward to join the Trinamool Congress.
The Trinamool of eligible leaders of any party is welcome.
Prior to the election of the five Municipalities on November 22, the seizure of Trinamool on the Board of the Municipalities is seen as important in political circles due to the change of party of the Congress Pashtuns in the Sahelthiya Municipalities.
Earlier, Trinamool was seized by the Congress-ruled Palika Board in Haldia and Nadia, which is also a case in point.
When Trinamool is seized by the Municipal Board in the districts due to the change of the party, those who join the party are welcomed to the Trinamool building located in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Rai is excited to break away from other parties and join the Trinamool of the leaders.
He said that those who come from any party are welcome in the Trinamool.
He claimed that the people's confidence in the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is growing as a result of people wanting to join the Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party Makpa said lower-level leaders of other parties are being intimidated and intimidated.
The people of the Trinamool Congress are afraid of the terror.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is seen as an attack on Makpa democracy.
Democratically, any party has the right to increase its membership but it is legitimate to raise questions about the justification for making changes with the help of the power.
Australian woman appealed against Thai jail term <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney has been sentenced to 15 days in jail in Fuket for falsely accusing the attack on a taxi driver, she has appealed against the decision and has been granted bail.
On June 15, the Fuket Provincial Court found Steve Russell Bombford guilty of misapprehending the Thai police, accusing him of trying to stop him by a local taxi driver with two other people on Sunday morning.
But later, C.C.T.V. footage revealed that she had returned to the hotel safely after being separated from her Australian Boyfriend.
When asked by the fucket police to question Bamfort for two days, he admitted to telling the story.
He was kept in the local police custody prior to the hearing in court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-security detention centre in the outer area of the fuselage instead of an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tunks, who has applied to the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra to assist her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sande Telegraph that the whole family is "extremely concerned" about her daughter's care and they want to call her back to Australia.
Tunks said: "It's certainly been a worrying time for us, but we hope that he will be back home soon."
Bamfod has appealed against the penal order, and has received bail on 50,000 bails.
During this time, the report in Australia said that she was celebrating holidays at a place celebrating the holiday of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand said that Bamford's case was being fought by a local lawyer in the fucket, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court may extend his sentence by extending his order for two years and oblige him to stay in adult prison.
Similarly, in the wake of the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Fuket, Thailand could also be blamed for the efforts to improve its bad tourist image.
