Camille Auer wanted to correct her gender, was diagnosed with mental illness, and now she is doing art on the subject - "Man should have the right to his own body"
Dozens of patient reports are hanging from the roof of the Academy of Fine Arts’ Project Room gallery.
Each of them has a name for Camille Auer.
The papers tell a multi-year story of how outsiders have written up their interpretation of Auer and his identity.
They decided for her who she is.
“I wanted to tell a person my treatment history, so that the violence of the process could be seen,” Auer says.
In the process, he refers to the process of sexual correction.
It is often a years-long research period involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, and doctors.
The process starts with the dispatch of a "sex identity disorder" to diagnostic studies, which are carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
With Auer, the process started four years ago.
Prior to this, he had used the estrogen he ordered via the internet and was, by the way, very long in his own repair process.
She felt that she was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person has to go through the repair process so that the sex can also be corrected legally.
The Translaw, the transsek law on the strengthening of the sex of the male child (563/2002), obliges transgender people to undergo forced sterilization in order to obtain, for example, a population registration centre and a passport.
At the moment, the correction of every gender is required from a psychiatrist for diagnosis and proof of incapacity for reproduction.
A person has the right to decide on his own body.
“This situation is intolerable and violates human rights,” says Auer.
Translating has been talked about in Finland for a long time.
The UN Human Rights Council has issued eight observations and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary ruling obliging the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to respect the right to self-determination.
The previous Finnish government prepared a change of law under the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovisen.
The elections were held, and the Finnish people rose to power.
Now the law change is stuck again.
It is a matter of internal political disputes that are not even related to this law.
“The government does not want to put it on the table because there are disagreements within the government about changing the law,” said Frank Johansson, Amnesty Finland’s chief operating officer.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the packs and instructions for use of medicines used by Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the psychology of the transpoli of the University Hospital in Tampere from Auer.
The psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report based on them, which should define the treatment of Auer’s right to be treated as well as to receive help.
The sense of reality to be explored is exposed to snoring.
The concept of self-exploration appears to be fragmented at a borderline level and the unstable characteristics associated with personality are highlighted.
Auer did not recognize himself from these descriptions.
“It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with mental illness,” Auer says.
An even greater shock was when Auer was not given gender remedial treatment.
According to the medical staff, his strength was not enough to start the process.
He was denied his identity.
Then, on February 11, 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked Transpol into the waiting room television.
Later on, a work of art called Monument for the Excluded was created on that television, in which Auer reflected his experience of power and its use.
“It’s crazy that anyone who’s defined as a woman at birth can increase their breasts, but to remove their breasts needs a diagnosis,” Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are anything but a defined amount of your sex at birth.
Unfortunately, Auer’s experience is not the only quality.
For many people, the process of gender reassignment is more difficult for mental reasons than purely for medical operations.
Through it, they meet dozens of people who have to justify their own existence and are entitled to their own sexual experience.
“It’s crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment, claiming that their resources aren’t enough,” Auer says.
Many people who apply for the process have a background in psychological symptoms: depression, anxiety, possible experiences of harassment.
With these referrals, the caregiver may order that treatment cannot be initiated.
“Preventing treatment and getting help can feed a person into an even worse situation than it was before the process began,” Auer says.
Auer’s own exhibition also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the text of the exhibition, Auer writes: “I’ve had suicidal thoughts all my adult life and it’s something that people usually find difficult to digest.”
Depression has been treated with medicines and when Auer started to use hormones, he was relieved.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had already existed in his childhood and adolescence.
That’s why the wide jaw didn’t seem to fit into your body and why the chest muscles had to be round instead of flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer is that there are people close to him who see him.
Being seen is a basic need.
“You have to justify yourself so much by talking, dressing, using sound and moving,” he says.
Today, Auer is already experiencing his coming, he exists as a woman.
However, in the early stages of the process, casual comments from close relatives could have hurt a lot.
It hurts the most when your loved ones misbehave.
“They should know and they know who I am, but they don’t agree or can’t internalize it,” he continues.
However, not all trans-humans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, i.e. body conflict, where the body or its parts can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and a long research process, it is not possible to get official confirmation for their own sex.
“These studies do not have any kind of medical basis,” Auer says.
And that's true.
In Denmark, for example, in June 2014 Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal gender.
The new legislation is based on the right to self-determination in relation to the legal sex.
A full-time applicant makes a written application for a new personal identification stating that he or she is experiencing a second gender.
After half a year of consideration, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the Ministry shall provide the applicant with a new identity.
This right of self-determination is also required in Finland and this requirement is also reflected in the Auer exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for the artist, but an exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art still has a lot of weight and that it can bring about political changes, at a time when politicians have forgotten about human rights.

The Civil Rights Organization issued a travel warning to Missouri
The National NAACP, which promotes African-American civil rights, has issued a travel warning about Missouri, which is the state's discriminatory practices and racist attacks that have taken place there.
"NAACP's Travel Information on Missouri will come into force on 28.8.2017, and it will call on African-American travelers, visitors and locals to pay special attention and to comply with extreme caution when traveling in a state that has been in the past decade
The law, which came into force recently in Missouri, makes it difficult to export cases of discrimination to justice. Moreover, the implementation of state laws is disproportionate to minorities. According to the NAACP, these factors led to the issuance of a travel warning.
“People’s rights are being violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of their skin color and abused or killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri, told Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard of the same number of cases in a short period of time."
The Missouri travel information is the organization’s first state-of-the-art warning.
The organization cited racist comments made against African-American students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year. He was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel. Missouri police arrested him, even though he was not charged with a crime.
The travel report also referred to a Missouri Attorney General’s report that police are 75 percent more likely to stop a black driver than a white one.
“The purpose of the food briefing is to urge people to be on guard and to warn their families, friends and coworkers about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People have to prepare, for example, by taking money to pay for guarantees or telling their relatives that they are going to travel through the state.”
According to the FBI, in 2015, there were hundreds of atrocities in Missouri, the sixteenth most of the U.S. states.
The Travel Warning is also a response to Missouri’s new law that makes it harder to challenge companies for discrimination in housing and working conditions.
The ACLU, a civil rights organization under the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had approved immigration laws that oblige police officers to detain people from immigration violations. According to the organization, this adds to the racial profiling.
In general, travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and they apply to other countries, but in recent times, NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintil<0xC3><0xA4> asked Finnair for an explanation of the CEO’s additional pension
Economy Minister Mika Lintil<0xC3><0xA4> (Central) has asked Finnair for an explanation of the additional pension payment received by the CEO of the airline, Pekka Vauramo, Yle says.
According to the minister, it is in conflict with the state will.
Vauramo’s additional pension of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>130,000 came up this week, when Helsinki’s Sanomat reported on the remuneration development of the managers of the stock companies.
Finland’s Kuvalehti announced Vauramo’s supplementary pension in February.
Finnair said it would give up additional pensions in 2013.
The state has stated that additional pensions are not used for remuneration.
The state owns more than half of Finland.
According to the company, the decision is in line with last year’s principle decision on ownership control.
Immediate squabbling of words
Some time ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on the way from cold to warm.
During the G20 summit in Hamburg, U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met and appeared to be coming together in a great way.
Since then, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions, which were approved by the U.S. Congress last week and signed by Trump on Wednesday, were reacted harshly by Russia.
The most alarming response so far has been heard from Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who said Trump’s sanctions act meant “full-scale trade war.”
While Russian reactions would only appear to be political rhetorical peaks and overruns, the tightening between the US and Russia is a fact after a short month of Trump’s post-election curfew.
In the United States, the passage of the sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea was not easy.
Congress, however, accepted the law as a significant consensus, but it was much more difficult for the president to pass the law.
Trump also criticized his recent signing of the law as “significantly flawed.”
President Trump’s sneezing appears to have been the reason, especially for Russia, even though the adoption of a law restricting its own sovereign rights has also had to be counterintuitive.
As is well known, there is an investigation in the United States into both Russia’s possible involvement in the presidential elections and the Trump campaign’s Russian connections.
The tightening between the United States and Russia is a fact after a short month of curfew.
When the White House staff has changed their minds and various scandalous twists have been revealed to be almost up-to-date, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy is not done in the United States under the leadership of the president, but despite the president.
Such a situation is by no means desirable.
If Russia’s relationship is a spice in the United States, the same applies to the European Union.
In addition to economic sanctions, the tense security situation in the Union's core region in the Baltic Sea is also tightening relations.
The EU has clearly highlighted the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained at least the dominant party in its Russian policy, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a member country that does a lot of trade with Russia like Finland, economic sanctions have been a real mess.
The effects of the new U.S. law are still unclear.
In the EU, it has been feared that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, the effects can be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear power project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the fact that, for example, liquid natural gas lng, which is important for the US economy, has been left out of the sanctions.
Trade packages are a way in world politics to show abuse.
However, economic sanctions must be well-considered and precise.
Otherwise, they are easily more harmful than beneficial.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Trump’s White House now has a Freedom Patch on its way
The lack of grass is certainly a sign of a change in power.
The Americans know it as well as the others: the Iraqis, together with the American soldiers, crashed Saddam Hussein’s statue in the Firdos square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the top ideologues in the Trump administration, knew well what he was doing in a heated debate with CNN’s Jim Acosta. The Freedom Party was subjected to Miller’s attack in a speech that concerned the president’s proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really appreciate the duck itself.
If he had done so, he would have encountered a vast array of cruise organisers and characters imitating the Statue of Liberty.
The purpose of his attack was the importance of the statue, especially the addition of the poem by Emma Lazarus to the statue in 1903, 17 years after the statue was completed.
As Miller put it, “I don’t want to go into history anymore, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the whole world.
The poem was later added, and it does not belong to the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller wasn’t wrong, but it’s not just about history, as he said.
The most important are the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones of his quality, in which the state calls not only immigrants but the "poorest poor": "Your tired, your poor, / Your haughtled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refusal of your teeming shore."
The poem is more up-to-date than ever.
Miller did not take literary criticism at all, but he made it clear that the “poorest of the poor” are not welcome in Trump’s United States.
The debate about the importance of the Statue of Liberty is part of a broader political and cultural debate about the importance of the United States.
Lazarus' friends campaigned after his death for the poem to be attached to his leg, and they knew very well that the act was highly political.
The purpose of Patsa was to express the connections of French and American republicanism with a classical image of comparison, with the female embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the feminine is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: the mother of the exiled.
The novel’s inclusion in the picture was a nefarious feminist coup d’état and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the pataca, and the right has long wanted to turn it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh, a director who can now be seen as some kind of premonition of Trump, claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not present an invitation to anyone, but is an early pioneer of the neo-conservatives, who leads the United States to embrace the darkness to hide the world.
He takes freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
“There is no way to escape to the United States.”
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The importance of freedom depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted, but you are hoping for immigrants from the docks of the ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the point of view of people looking for a better life.
His Statue of Liberty comforts us by giving us hope and by welcoming us.
And Miller and Trump don't want that at all.
Their lust does not show the way, but burns up the flames of anger, their only source of strength.
World Championships in Athletics 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom national team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots got into the UK national team
Neil Black, the UK’s general athletics federation’s chief scorer, says the 16 Scottish teams participating in the World Cup are “significant reinforcements.”
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Athletics Championships in London, starting Friday.
According to Black, in Scotland "there is something special going on" that the British public sports must learn from.
“This is welcome, and we will continue to explore it for so long that we understand what the question is,” Black says.
“I spoke with representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport and they thought it was related to the institute’s activities.
The Scottish General Sports Federation, in turn, believes that it is related to the activities of the Union,
and the United Kingdom's sports federation believes that it is behind their activities.
And the usual street vendor thinks that he has to have something to do with it.
It’s a great thing, no matter where it comes from.”
A lot of Scottish athletes compete in London in serious metres, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in a 5,000-metre race. Eilidh Doyle was chosen as the captain of the national team.
"There is a need to be humble.
“His captain’s speech was amazing,” Black said.
“The fans left the opportunity proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, no matter where they happen to live and practice.
In the words of the second, there was a genuine feeling and passion for sport.”
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist in the 400-meter hurdles of the National Community Championships, and these are his fifth World Championships. In his opinion it is "incredible" that the national team has 16 Scots.
The previous record was seven years in 1983 and 2015.
Laura Muir, a middle-distance runner, has run five UK and two European records over the course of the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1,500 metres in London and is also worth keeping in mind: the man has an excellent season behind him, including winning the UK World Cup and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Championship, when the only shot of the national team in addition to him was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he is "extremely proud" that there are so many Scots involved, some of whom are seriously competing for final places and medals.
“It’s a great honor to be a captain, but even more so because the members of the national team voted for the captain,” Doyle said.
“I’m very proud of all the Scottish players who came to the national team.
It shows how far we've come.
They’re a well-deserved athlete who competes in prize pools.
Captain's speech?
I think it went really well.
I was thinking about how lucky we are when we have homeschooling.
It is important to enjoy the support of the local community and the fact that we are at the Olympic Stadium again.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know that the atmosphere is going to be incredibly great.”
Preventing critics on Facebook: Don’t put yourself in a public office if you can’t stand criticism
Our country's father knew what a bad publicity was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticize him for all possible domestic politics, always on his political principles.
Criticism must have been irritating.
But he did not silence his critics.
“If freedom of speech is removed, we may be led stupid and silent as sheep to be slaughtered,” Washington said in 1783.
We'll get to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff have removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and blocked their performers.
The U.S. Civil Rights Union challenged Hogan’s case earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge unwarranted, and the attitude was also debatable online.
"What does it matter? This is just Facebook," many commented.
But it does matter,
Especially in Hogan's case.
Hogan is the amazingly popular Republican governor of a Democratic-ruled state.
He has been ranked second among the top 50 Governors for his work.
Hogan is not sensitive to heat.
He has led the state firmly and has strictly adhered to the principles.
He has also skillfully used Facebook as the main contact channel for his voters and published a photo of his bald head in chemotherapy there.
That is why it is unnecessary and even dangerous to prevent users coming to the governor’s Facebook page. The governor’s page is a public and official forum maintained by his staff in the form of tax resources.
Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in an interview with the Washington Post, which she said was only about the moderation of comments.
However, labeling commenters as trolls, spammers or haters is too easy a solution.
The Washington Post interviewed Hogan’s Facebook users.
They turned out to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to their chosen leaders. They were not trolls but, for example, teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors.
They said that their comments were respectful, considerate, and relevant.
The pastor borrowed the book in his comment; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of the Maryland Bowie was not hostile but asked the question of hate crimes.
“I politely commented that I was disappointed that Hogan had not taken the stand for hate crimes and other recent news,” he wrote in the Washington Post’s comments.
"I also cannot accept the fact that when more people comment on the same thing, they are immediately considered in some way organized as a group and sidelined as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called the comments "a focused attack", and someone else could call them to promote the most important issues.
In the age of Facebook, communication is easy to manage by blocking a reviewer or removing a critical comment.
Before the old man was supposed to send staff to collect and burn newspapers that had been published critical headlines, or to detain and silence protesters.
It’s actually the same thing, now only digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of stalking Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users blocked by President Trump have challenged him in court.
The first major decision was taken in Virginia last week.
Alexandria District Judge James C. Cacheris said the Loudou County government violated the first addition to the U.S. Constitution by blocking the voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Union went to discuss the use of Twitter and Facebook with Republican Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky.
This shouldn't be difficult.
At the time of Washington, cheap postage had a similar effect to today’s internet.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers plagued Washington.
There were trolls at the time.
The names of Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers in which they mocked Washington’s decisions.
The President's Office was flooded with requests to review the Jay Agreement, the Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom, as evidenced by the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of speech, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the cornerstones of our nation.
True leadership is the acceptance of this fact.
The summer feeding of birds should be stopped immediately.
Samples have come from about half a dozen locations, and also online announcements from a couple, three.
Most of them have come from Southern Finland and Varsinais-Finland, but then also individuals from Haapaveta and Sein<0xC3><0xA4>jota, says specialist Marja Isomursu Evira.
Green bees have died of trichomoniasis in the luminosity.
It is caused by an animal called Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to strike on the paws, and especially on the paws.
However, in the 2000s, the disease began to be detected also from the pituitary glands.
In 2009 he was doing well.
At that time, the tricomonosis caused a large collapse in the Finnish green beet population, after which the species’ positions have been revived.
The diseased green beets have now been, but not yet on a large scale, says Juha Honkala, museum master at the University of Helsinki’s Natural Science Centre Museum (Luumus).
It is alarming that the previous epidemic of green bees will resume if nothing is done.
What you need to do now is a very simple thing that everyone can do: stop the summer feeding of birds immediately.
More on the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from the Renaissance Club’s home turf
Former European first player Ronan Rafferty hopes to take advantage of the home run for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Last year, Rafferty led the tournament at the Archerfield Links in Northern Ireland, but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty has opted for a new place and serves as the tournament's ambassador for the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
“I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it will be fully restored to its glory,” Rafferty says.
"The players see the field at its best, it's in great condition.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's an enthusiastic ambassador for the game, and he's proud of his achievements here.
The tournament is a great showcase for this field."
Englishman Eales defends the championship for the first time, even though he has won his 32-year career on both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
“This feels like a really special opportunity,” says a player living in Southport.
"I was not able to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because the tournament is not part of the tour this year.
It's great to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year’s memories come to mind: the tournament win was a great thing for me and my wife, Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember.”
Gary Orr returns to action on his own soil, leaving for the tour after 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
“Playing at home is always more important than usual,” says Orr, who lives in Helensburgh.
“You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I’ve enjoyed playing again and I’ve played hard.
I’m happy with my game so far.”
The trio will be joined by former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior major tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament will feature six Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance, as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There is free access to the tournament. Car parking costs <0xC2><0xA3>5 if there is only a driver in the car, and <0xC2><0xA3>10 if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
In the case, the possible internal air problems of the barracks were solved.
At least for the time being, no indoor air problems have been found in the building of the Pori Prikaat communications company, the prikaat was reported on Thursday.
Inland air research is continuing.
Investigations began when a man who suspended his men’s equipment for health reasons suspected that his health had deteriorated due to poor indoor air.
According to Mika Holman, the team's chief of staff, there were no problems with the health of other crew members.
It turned out that this was an individual case and that the other servants in that unit had no health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously, and we wanted to make a thorough analysis of this.
At the moment, it is not known that we would have any indoor air problem, Holma says.
The Prikaat report says that due to the arrival of July, the goods had to be transferred to barracks, which is why the amount of dust could have increased instantaneously.
The air may have seemed intrusive, Holma says.
Poverty and Death in the Golden State of Indonesia
Bardina Degei does not use hemp in the kitchen.
He rarely uses cats as well.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai region, located in Indonesia’s restless province of Papua. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the bataat – locally “note” – directly in his fireplace.
After half an hour, the potatoes burned on the grill are eaten in an open, hands-free manner.
Degei’s house has no furniture. He sits on a muddy painting, where he usually also handles his daily steps, such as washing in the same water that is sought after from the nearby salt of the laundry.
The office of the store is provided by a vacuum cleaner in the roofless room.
Degei is the youngest of four wives of her husband, and has not been appointed to care for the fields.
Diversity is common here.
Working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot. In addition, the soldiers must be taken into account.
“No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening,” Degei says.
This is a rare turbulence on the outskirts of Papua, in the former Dutch colony, which was annexed to Indonesia in 1969. A controversial referendum preceded the accession, in which 1,026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The Dutch anti-independence local movement quickly turned its anger into the Jakarta government, which keeps the region under tight control and prevents foreign journalists and human rights defenders from accessing it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, and the eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is a remote and cobbler. The journey there begins with a half-hour flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and continues with a five-hour drive on the rental car.
There is no public transport here.
Around 19,000 people live in the city, surrounded by bamboo-covered wooden houses, with wave-particles of rust dyed into bells.
Only a few Indonesians have visited here, not to mention the journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Papuan Mee Pago natives worshipped the Uga Tamee god.
Other changes have taken place.
"We didn't have such clothes," Degei says. He means colorful, hand-woven with his knitting headband, dark hat and bright-colored sweater.
"Before, we only had leaves covering our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28 per cent of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are the highest in Asia.
But it is also the gold of Indonesia.
Paniai is about the size of New Jersey, with a population of 153,000. Only about a hundred kilometers from Paniai is Grasberg, the world’s largest and most profitable gold mine. It is owned by Freeport McMoran, a company headquartered in Phoenix, USA.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper to Freeport.
In addition, Papua is estimated to have $78 billion in timber reserves.
However, these riches bring misery to the Papuans, as they mean the stifling presence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military personnel and local military units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, and that up to $150,000 was paid to individual officers.
The demands of the Pope for a greater right of self-determination threaten this source of income, and they are silenced without mercy.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian army has since 1969 killed more than 500,000 Papuans and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the upper Papua tribes in the 1970s were measured in terms of genocide.
Last year, Indonesian police detained more than 3,900 people in the area in peaceful demonstrations.
The Brisbane Archdiocese’s 2016 report, We Will Lose Everything, reports on the atrocities of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – rapes and e-mails are particularly popular means – and the relentless attacks on the peace process.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are cases per week,” says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Ruuvia has been tightened as Papuan natural resources attract migrants from other parts of Indonesia.
83 per cent of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but the population gap is changing as Indonesians from the islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi move Muslims to the region in the hope of a better livelihood.
Javanese warungs sell roasted chicken and gado-gado vegetables in peanut butter sauce.
Locals find it difficult to compete.
“The farmers have started selling chicken and vegetables on the square cheaper than the locals,” says Abeth You, a 24-year-old from Pania, who moved to the province’s capital after work.
"Local women have lost their customers."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo – nicknamed Jokowi – promised in his 2014 election campaign to intervene in Papuan injustices and human rights violations.
Papua is made up of 29 regions, and this former treehead won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on its way to the presidential seat of Jakarta.
But only a little has changed with Papua, and the locals feel cheated.
“Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokow in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our wishes and restore justice,” You said.
Pania experienced some sort of wave-based experience just two months after Jokow’s October inauguration.
Eleven children were singing Christmas songs at the village of Enarotal on December 7, 2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on motorcycles.
The frightened children told the soldiers that they should use driving lights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Theba, the man returned to the scene with four soldiers.
According to reports of the victims and witnesses, the soldiers who drank took the children and abused them by hanging on the gunpowder.
So one of the soldiers shot at the children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of the abuse.
A few hours later, the building of the state electoral board, located near the venue, was set on fire, and the next day began to take place.
About 1,000 Papuans – young men and women as well as children – gathered at the football field to demand the right to stand in front of the local police station and army command center.
They were involved in a series of hunts for party expenses, and they began performing the traditional Waita dances of the Papuan Mee Pago world, where they danced in circles and imitated the song of birds.
Some of the protesters began to stone the buildings of the police and army.
When the atmosphere got hot, the soldiers in the internal radio system were given the command: "If the crowds make a resistance more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on the official document of TIME magazine, which has not been published to local media.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto area, openly shook hands with the situation and asked the crowd to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot on my left wrist," he told TIME magazine with a scissor in his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
"A number of shots were fired at the gunman."
Alfius Youwia was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shots.
“I ran to him and made sure it was really him,” John told TIME magazine with sadness. Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papua police inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that the police were only "protecting" the police station because it was the target of the attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Pudjo Sulistiyo, a Papuan police spokesman, said in 2015.
"Then it's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The death was reported to Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
“I want the case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again.”
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he will launch investigations of human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he immediately began to cancel his speech.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early 2000s.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the violations, but it requires certain processes," he said.
In an interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5.6.2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he did not intend to start investigations in Papua.
“Everything will be settled in court,” he said.
The UN accuses Wiranto of "crimes against humanity". The crimes are linked to the deaths of more than a thousand people in East Timor's bloodied independence vote in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases have already been cleared of Papuan human rights violations, including Pania's events.
The families of the victims of the panic deal with the claims of the darkly unbelieving.
“I’ve been challenged four times in the last three years, but things haven’t progressed in any way,” says John.
"I'm already tired of this."
He says he’s still living in fear, even though it’s been years since the incident.
“Yes, I’m afraid,” he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panicists dare not discuss the event.
He says that the soldiers had insulted him when he had helped bury four of the victims.
“The soldiers are looking for me in their hands after burying the victims,” he says.
The shooting is not over.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the Pania neighborhood of Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a clash between the villagers and the head of the construction company, which began when the manager refused to take the man who lost his mind to the hospital. Among the injured were also children.
The man in need of hospital treatment was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who had been caught fishing in a nearby river while on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers showed their minds at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers were stoned by police who responded to the warnings.
According to locals, however, a police unit moving the Indonesian semi-domestic police opened fire on a crowd, at which time one villager was killed.
“We’re terrified. We’re afraid of revenge,” says 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw when the injured were brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for shots to be fired at the police and for the removal of a moving police force from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development feeds on dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal communities living in the middle lanes of Papua.
Many have joined the Papuan Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papuans through random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of OPM are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily detaining and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name of “national sovereignty protection.”
Some of those arrested will never come back.
Among the Papuans, Paniai is known as "a sad, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds on dissatisfaction.
Only a small amount of rice is sold in Enarotal, and it is too expensive for locals.
as well as bread.
People grow their own food: mainly potatoes and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
The cultivation is the work of women, and the responsibility of one woman can be four or five potato peels.
Most of it is for the family, and the rest is sold on the market.
Ten potatoes cost only 10,000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the differences in local and migrant arrivals have increased, and the number of migrants has increased since new routes were opened at Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs, and they usually go locally for better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Only a few parrots have enough capital and skills to run their own company in a competitive manner.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village because there’s no work or money here,” said John Gobai, president of the Paniai National Council.
The remote Papua is left with little attention in the world.
In addition, the restrictions on international news are still tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papu, although they had been granted a rare description permit. The official reason was the inability to co-operate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kinen, Asia’s assistant director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept his election promises. He has not increased transparency and has not promoted development by removing the limitations of news.
“Indonesia’s most restless eastern provinces, Papua and West Papua, news reporters have new risks: visa waivers and blacklisting,” Kine said in a statement.
The lack of freedom of the press means that the Indonesian government is pressuring only the neighbouring ports of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the “numerous and widespread violations” of Papua, including the Pania shooting site.
These countries have traditionally also supported the Papuan Liberation Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the allegations and told reporters in Jakarta that “Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations.”
The locals want the foreign governments to intervene in the matter.
When the Dutch official delegation led by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar visited Jayapura on May 4, 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, a source who attended the meeting said.
There are presidential elections in Indonesia in 2019, but Papuans say they are no longer likely to vote for Jokovia.
"Jokowi means good, but there are people around him who are involved in Pania's shooting," said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokow to know the situation of the Panicists: they live under the power of a greedy and unpredictable army in poverty and poverty, practically without health care services and educational opportunities.
According to Goba, the Panicists, like the other Papalists, hold the votes they give to Jokow "debt", which must be repaid.
“They don’t want money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threat and fear, the victims of the Pania shooting once again demonstrated resistance in a symbolic way: they buried one of the victims in a police station and an army post in the opposite country.
They know they may never get justice, but at least they don’t let the responsible ones forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus said in a statement.
“What else could we do?”
Dereck Chisora says Robert Helene's re-election bid will be cancelled: "Even his fans don't want to see it"
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisora, the boxers of the heavy series, were scheduled to play in the Hartwall arena on May 27.
However, the match was cancelled for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, Chisora echoes the reason for flopping the replay entirely on Helenius’ shoulders.
My match in Finland was a flop, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even her fans don't want to see her fighting because she's ugly, Chisora gets bored.
Helenius and Chisora met for the first time in a full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
The ticket sales of the re-selection went smoothly, and its promoter, Nisse Sauerland, told Ilta-Sanomi in May that the match had been postponed to autumn.
There is nothing new in the game.
However, the resignation no longer harms Chisora.
The match would probably have had to be cancelled in any case after Chisora's illness.
On Thursday, three days before the match, I woke up to severe pain.
My bull was in the explosions.
The hospital said I had to be cut, Chisora says.
Britti says she is currently in about 45 percent condition.
He is not interested in re-matching with Helenius, but rather Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss to Whyt in December.
He was re-emerged in Dubai by the Torch Mountaineer.
The flames seized the world’s tallest listed residential building in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee 337 meters from the 79-story building.
This was already the second fire in two years in the building, which happens to be called Torch, hit.
The building was cleared, and no one is known to have been injured. The cause of the fire was not known immediately after the incident.
“We were sleeping and woke up to the sound of a fire alarm and people’s screams.
We would run down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes,” a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai’s rescue officials said the fire broke out at four o’clock in the morning and left the building to cool down.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case may raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
The board of directors of the Torch building carried out a study after the 2015 fire, in which it was found that the most damage suffered by the plates used for the curtain and insulation of the facade.
In the UK, police believe that London’s Grenfell Tower insulation and cladding plates could contribute to the rapid progress of the flames in a fire that killed 80 people in June.

In the United States, more than 20 percent of air passengers take prohibited items on board, a survey reveals.
A survey of air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of passengers in the United States had taken prohibited items knowingly or unknowingly onto planes past the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) checkpoints, with at least six percent of those on the road not crossing the bridge.
Less than one percent said they only found out afterwards that they were carrying weapons, ammunition or explosives in error.
The survey was answered by more than a thousand passengers, and was conducted by Stratos Jet Charters. The results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to defy the rules of others.
Of the passengers who knowingly violated TSA’s rules, 19.7% were Y-generation and less than 15% were X-generation.
Most often, the rules were violated by taking food and liquids to the plane.
More than three per cent of the participants knowingly admitted to the aircraft that they were carrying with them, and 2.2 per cent of the women and 3.7 per cent of the men reported that they were knowingly not to take drugs to the aircraft.
Passengers from all over the United States took part in the survey. The company that conducted the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally carried out a security check and how many had done so knowingly.
It is not surprising that the most frequented passengers are also most likely to carry out security checks – knowingly or unknowingly.
But, as the company that conducted the survey notes, TSA’s instructions are quite complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what liquids to take to the plane and how much.
So it is no surprise that most of the TSA’s trappings are liquids.
For some time, there was also the belief that books should not be taken to the plane.
Liquids may be exported to domestic flights but not to international flights.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruitt has reversed his decision to delay Obama’s decision to cut emissions.
The day after 15 states had challenged the EPA’s Scott Pruitt law, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Pruitt’s earlier decision to delay the Obama administration’s decisions to reduce emissions of smoke.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he leads takes better account of the needs of decision-makers responsible for state environmental issues.
Mr Pruitt did not mention in a word the plea brought against his earlier decision before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The Member States should start to comply with the 2015 ozone level from 1 October onwards.
Pruitt announced in June that he will move the implementation of the decisions year on year so that his agency will have more time to get familiar with the plan because the agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt was a U.S. Attorney General in Oklahoma before President Donald Trump appointed him as the head of the EPA and is known to be against stricter environmental regulations.
Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions opposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden shift in Wednesday’s mood is the latest return to Pruitt’s plan to ease regulations.
A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., last month, ruled that the head of the EPA overstepped his authority in trying to delay the implementation of the Obama administration’s decision on oil and gas companies. The decision obliged my companies to monitor and monitor
In a statement on Wednesday evening, Mr Pruitt said that his full translation of the Ozone Regulations only strengthens the EPA's cooperation with the states in a complex process aimed at meeting the new requirements on schedule.
“During previous administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with deadlines and then waited for activist groups and others to challenge the right to enter into an agreement on schedules,” Pruitt said. He challenged in his previous action to the Environmental Agency’s right to cross the border.
“We don’t believe in regulation through court proceedings and we take deadlines seriously.
We are also serious about the regulation on our activities and the Finnish authorities."
However, the EPA statement stated that Pruitt could continue to use "its powers to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and based on the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader change in ozone regulations.
The legislative initiative adopted last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, a New York State attorney general who led the EPA’s law-challenging coalition this week, said the group plans to continue the pressure.
“As a result of our complaints, EPA’s change of mind is a significant gain for those 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of community smoking,” Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the plaintiffs included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Ozone is created when, for example, emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants react to sunlight in the atmosphere.
This can lead to serious respiratory problems for sensitive groups of people, which is also the cause of thousands of premature deaths each year.
Proponents of public health and environmentalists rejoiced at Pruitt’s surprising change of direction.
“It is worrying how much pressure was required to make sure that the guy in charge of our breathing space was using common sense,” says Lori Ann Burd of the Biodiversity Center.
“We have to fight against the Trump administration, because its ideological goal is to act on the terms of the polluters and other groups who take their own advantage.”
From the manufacturer of supercars to be a roof fan - "events in the style of Ferrari"
It also plans to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to hold onto its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will happen in the style of Ferrari, CEO Sergio Marchionne said of the plans at a news conference on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year, when the Italian supercar manufacturer will present its new five-year plan, Automotive News reports.
All East Savo’s ashtray cases of the same virus type
Asparagus asparagus infection is the same type of virus as previous cases of East Savo, reports THL.
On Thursday, the virology laboratory of the Department of Health and Welfare confirmed that the fifth ash-lacquer infection in Eastern Savo is the same virus strain as previous infections.
THL has confirmed that an ash-infected person on Friday, July 28, has the same type of virus as previous cases of East Savo.
On the basis of this information, all infections detected in East Savo are related to the first ashtray detected in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not been exposed to other types of ash-rococci virus.
However, it is possible that new infections may occur after the fifth patient until mid-August, and therefore the epidemic is not yet over, says Dr. Mirkaleena Erkkil<0xC3><0xA4>, who is responsible for Soster’s underlying health care infection.
No new or suspected asparagus infections have been reported since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of their own vaccination protection up-to-date, Erkkil<0xC3><0xA4> recalls.
More on the topic: In Pirkanmaa, three new ash-rococcus infections were confirmed - "Additional infections or epidemics are very unlikely"
Finland Prepares for Permitted Shielding
Pontic cuisine was not even considered legal.
On the basis that the process produces, in addition to wine, methanol, which is toxic.
Making a kiln at home is legal next year, but the legalization of a pontoon soup is not even considered.
The kiln is prepared by fermentation, the pontoon again by distillation.
The basis of the regulation of distillation is that the process produces, in addition to wine, methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to regulate the pontiff’s ban on the right of every man, the government council Ismo Tuominen commented on the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry prepared for the reform of the alcohol tax, the distillation of the bridge was not considered legal.
It was also not brought to the political table.
There is no debate on the liberalisation of immigration, says People's Representative Outi M<0xC3><0xA4>kel<0xC3><0xA4> (Council).
He is in the negotiating group for the parliamentary groups of the governing parties, which took a position on the reform of the alcohol tax.
You can't even grant a permit to stamp a dot at home.
Commercial manufacturing is also maintained as a licence.
The introduction tells us that the home preparation of alcoholic beverages comes with a simple rule: alcohol can be prepared at home during the procedure.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally make kilts at home.
The government wanted to simplify the rules.
The new law eliminates the requirements for flavourings and flavourings and allows for the manufacture of kilts, M<0xC3><0xA4>kel<0xC3><0xA4> refines.
The preparation must still be carried out in such a way that the raw materials or flavourings produced in the course of their fermentation are clearly visible.
According to the new law, you can prepare as much as you want, and you can give your own alcohol as a gift.
It is still not allowed to be sold.
The act of making a wedge is no longer a public health issue in Finland, Importing believes.
A much bigger change took place in 2004 when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will come to the hearing of the House as soon as the autumn season begins.
The General Assembly is 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament had already taken a position, M<0xC3><0xA4>kel<0xC3><0xA4> is pleased.
Oscar Pistorius was taken to hospital by armed guards.
Oscar Pistorius, who suffered from breast stones, was admitted to a South African hospital for heart failure.
Pistorius has already been discharged from the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius suffers from his prison sentence in Atteridgeville prison.
According to the British Mirror magazine, Pistorius was taken from the prison to the hospital this morning by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital in the afternoon.
The prison informant confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for examination.
A spokesman for the Pistorius family said the former top athlete is in good health.
Last summer, the Supreme Court sentenced a six-time Paralympic gold medalist to six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pistorius shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Literate phone conversations reveal Trump’s pressure on Mexico to build border wall
U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia's telephone conversations have leaked letters to the Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation on January 27, 2017, Trump urged Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto to end his public remarks that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States called Nieto about this having publicly stymied the wall project. “You can’t say that to the press,” Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published a briefing on Trump’s first phone call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, during which a harsh exchange of words was held.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take away refugees on their way to Australia is “stupid”, “stupid” and “stupid”. According to Trump, the deal negotiated during Obama’s term would make him seem “idiot” because he had proposed to ban refugees from U.S. housing.
Trump ended the call by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most unpleasant call of the whole day."
Georgia massacre: Activists re-shoot in hopes of racist lynching
The Ford Mercury-branded car crosses a crowd in the small town of Monroe in rural Georgia and continues its journey towards the small Moore's Ford Bridge.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, four armed men blocking the road before the car gets to the bridge.
A group leader, a middle-aged man dressed in a raisin dress, takes a deep breath from his cigar and swirls through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n--u!" the man exclaimed.
"Out of the car!"
Rumors break the silence when a young black man is dragged out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a re-enactment, which was presented on 22 July 2017.
However, the concussions of the shock are real when the suspension eyelid is pushed to "Roger's" neck.
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to re-enact the events of 1946, when the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has been charged with murder.
“It’s confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – even though the killers live among us and many need to know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the rehab arrangements.
“It is a disgrace to history, but above all it is a burden that weighs our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgia congressman.
To him, the reassignment is an urgent call to action, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that the injustice has never been rectified.
“We want the guilty to be brought to justice, we want things to finally be done, and we want to recover from grief and make reconciliation, but above all, we want justice,” Brooks said.
"We can't recover and make a deal until we get justice."
A death row investigator is covering up the body of the victim who died in the Georgian massacre on 27 July 1946.
According to NBC news reports, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of the lynching, according to the FBI.
No one was charged with the murder.
Although the culprits have been free for decades, activists say the motives for the crackdown have always been known to locals: politics and sex.
In 1946, the blacks of the State of Georgia were granted the right to vote for the first time in the presidential elections. The Supreme Court gave its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, during the election, there was an incident in which black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently affected Malcolm's wife Dorothy.
Brooks said the town was rumored that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting this child.
According to the FBI, the influential white landowner Loy Harrison paid Malcolm $600 bail on July 25, 1946, against which he was released from prison.
On their way home, Malcom and Dorothy were accompanied by their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford Bridge.
"It has been revealed that Harrison ordered and arranged the murders," the FBI said in a statement.
"It is also clear that there was a secret alliance between the state and the local authorities. The authorities were involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks makes this very clear.
“It was a murder,” he said.
“They were murdered because the blacks wanted to be told that they would do the same if they were going to vote.”
Cassandra Greene has been directing the re-enactment of the Georgian massacre for nearly a decade.
The proposal is extremely realistic and captivating; it is a description of shocking racism, which many would like to believe is already lost to the United States of America today.
It’s hard to watch the show, but it’s even harder not to watch what Greene says is the point.
“We don’t want to talk about lynching because we would have to face our own dark side,” the director says.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or don't want to hear what I've had to experience."
This year’s performance began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors – dozens of blacks and dozens of whites – gathered to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's assistant director.
He has been presenting the local leader of the Ku Klux Klan in the re-enactment for years, but the role is always as difficult and counter-intuitive.
“You become dirty because I’m not myself,” Marbaugh says.
“However, it is important that this side of history is also presented so that it never repeats itself again.”
On the other side of the room are Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The show begins with a scene where Malcom screams and stabs Hester, and he's angry that Hester has had a relationship with Dorothy.
"Don't you hear me? I said get out of my way, n--u!"
Rascona or Hester is the answer.
Then there's a hit.
And then all (at least all black actors) burst into laughter.
Greene laughs harder.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's confused.
"Did I hit too hard by accident?" he asked.
"You", Greene faints.
"I just don't think white people used the word n--u at the time."
"Yes", another black actor confirms.
"It's a slang. You have to use a longer version."
The subject of the presentation is unpleasant, but the power of the room is the spirit of a friend.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just because of the show, but because they want to honor the memory of those who died.
The meeting begins from the beginning.
Now Rascona's words are suffocating.
Nobody's laughing.
The resurgence will end quickly and violently.
Screams, shots – and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral gown stands next to the bodies and sings Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks at every other word.
A few hundred feet away, fifty spectators wipe their eyes with sand and tears.
Almost half of the population is black and half is white.
Among them is a couple who have come to watch a show about Ithaca from New York State, but most are local.
They've been guided by Brooks to the victims' graves in Georgia's oppressive wetlands.
The murders have turned from the story into a reality. The feeling at the scene is heavy.
After the performance, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The children tend to look at the blood and motionless bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," the little boy mumbles as if to remind himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the audience.
The actors who introduced the lynch mobs take their cues off and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hails Marbaugh, a man from the local Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a rough performance.
"It's okay," the woman in the show consoled.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason.”
Later, the audience and the actors will meet for a joint dinner.
The white couple from the exhibition are actively discussing the show with the black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski finds it difficult to find words when she describes the emotions aroused by the performance.
“It’s hard to listen to terrible words and watch terrible acts that people say and do that look the same as you do – just because they look the same as you do,” he says.
"My presentation made it clear that the shootings are still going on," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks remembers the development of civil rights for listeners sitting at the same table.
He says he’s already started planning for next year’s show.
“Restoring is a powerful experience because it portrays the horrors we’ve experienced, but it’s also a learning experience,” Brooks says.
“The message is that this can happen again if we don’t learn from it.
Those who don’t know their history are condemned to repeat it.”
Deployment of plants in stores scares: By removing this amount of "extra parts" really saves
Is it allowed to remove the flower petals in the store before weighing?
What about taking off a big hat from the pineapple - how much does it weigh?
The answers are strongly shared by the opinions: one is a sign of the extremely worn collar, while the other does not want to pay for the parts of the vegetables that are not used and which, however, go to waste at home.
The phenomenon is recognized in stores.
For example, in the vegetable department of Helsinki’s Ruoholahten K-Citymarket, there are cardboard boxes, because many of the cracks, for example, remove the leaves of the flower stalk.
From the box, the leaves are traded in biowaste.
According to the news published in the Economic Journal, the use of vegannestisks amazes traders.
But how much does removing the extra parts of the vegetables before weighing really save you money?
How important is the car really?
We Women will test how the price changes when you take the leaves or stems off the pineapple, latva artichoke, delicacy, peach and floral.
The price of the flower pot, which costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 2.10, was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 1.80 when all the leaves were peeled off.
Pineapple: The price of the total pineapple, which costs EUR 2.30, dropped to EUR 1.95 when its stock was withdrawn.
Latvian Artisan: The price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.60 was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.40 when the short-term position was cut off.
Sensitivities: Two sensitivities cost a total of 75 cents.
Without the poles, the price was 60 cents.
The average size of the parcel costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 and without carrying 80 cents.
Result: If the leaves and stems start to peel off, at best save a few tens of cents for one vegetable.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables fell by as much as 20 percent.
Of these purchases, it would have saved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.20!
Neymar bought out of Barcelona - brass star signed a five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French football club PSG, the news agency AFP reports.
Earlier Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid a draw price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million to FC Barcelona, who played in the Spanish league.
The maximum transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
The record was previously held at Manchester United, which paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million last summer from Frenchman Paul Pogba.
The Spanish League stopped the move earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment company of Neymar’s representatives.
According to the rules of the League, the association purchased cannot pay the exit price directly to the seller, but the player himself must buy out his contract, which is done by recycling money through the League.
In practice, PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money to Barcelona through the league.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
He will be presented to the new home crowd at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa investigates the details
In addition, Barcelona said in its communication that it would provide information on the payment of the European Football Association Uefalle so that the association can determine the possible disciplinary action in the case.
Among other things, Javier Tebas, president of the Spanish league, has suspected PSG of violating the rules of UEFA’s economic fair game through its use of money.
Uefa can punish a gang that makes over 30 million euros in losses over three years.
According to Uefa, Neymar’s move does not automatically violate its economic trajectory.
Neymar’s move to PSG has been affecting the company’s economy for several years, but the impact cannot be assessed in advance.
PSG may, for example, sell several players with significant amounts, UEFA reported.
PSG is owned by state-owned Qatari company Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis player, Nasser al-Khelaifi, from Qatar.

Austin, 21, got a much hotter shot of a salamander - stampede stored in airport security camera
Austin Dunn was working on a plane at the South Florida International Airport with a couple of workmates when suddenly a flash of lightning struck the plane from the rain sky.
Salama's force threw the plane's wings into the ground near Dunn.
Dunn was rushed to the hospital.
He had third-degree burns all over his body.
My father called me and said my brother got an e-mail and he's in the hospital.
I just asked her if she was alive, Austin's sister Autumn said.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and cerebral hemorrhage.
The experience was tough for the whole family.
That's not the way to expect it.
It's traumatic for everyone, Autumn says.
According to the airport representative, the Salamari warning system was in place and the transport company itself decides whether to comply with it.
Pearson cuts 3,000 jobs and revitalises business by cutting dividends
British education group Pearson announced on Friday that it would cut 3,000 jobs and cut its dividend by 72 per cent when starting a new structural programme in response to pressures on its business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job cuts will be made mainly at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company has already reduced 4,000 jobs in the context of previous construction arrangements.
Pearson announced that it would cut costs again by <0xC2><0xA3>300 million in May as part of its third savings programme, which aims to revive the business that has deteriorated as a result of rapid digitisation.
Last month, Pearson decided to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann. The company announced that it will keep its outlook for the year ahead. Its turnover grew by a percentage in the first half of the year and was <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Attack on a supporter in Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
The suicide bomber struck a military base in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials say.
According to NATO, five soldiers and interpreters were injured in the shooting.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh area of Kabul.
The blast is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month, and on Tuesday 30 people were killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, two people died in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to a NATO statement on Thursday evening, an explosion occurred when a joint NATO-Afghan army party was targeted for an attack by a "person carrying an explosive device of its own."
The statement said that the condition of all the injured was stable and they were treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the exchange of letters, the Taliban's strengthening and the presence of ISIS in Qarabagh are significant concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide camp in Kabul, where mostly Shiite Muslims live.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, more than 150 people were killed in a bomb attack in central Kabul, the country’s deadliest militant group since US-led forces invaded the Taliban in 2001.
The violence underscores Afghanistan’s unstable situation when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States is sending more troops to the country to help the local army and police.
According to the exchange of letters, the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also significantly undermined people’s trust in the government, its policy and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA rounds its decision to delay implementation of smoke-free provisions
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reversed its decision to delay the implementation of the Obama administration’s decisions to reduce smoke-free emissions a day after 15 states challenged the agency’s law.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called "Ozone Definitions" in late Wednesday, which, according to the Agency, is a testament to its commitment to cooperation with the states.
“We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the states,” Scott Pruitt, director of the agency, said in a statement.
In June 2018, Pruitt announced the Agency’s intention to postpone the implementation of the ozone definition for one year until October 2018. According to the definitions, smoke pollution is measured in certain parts of the country in order to determine where pollution needs to be reduced in accordance with even stricter air quality requirements.
On Tuesday, the agency sued 15 states, mainly run by Democrats, including the District of Columbia, which said it was illegal to delay the execution.
President Donald Trump’s administration has been looking for ways to alleviate Barack Obama’s pre-existing environmental regulations, according to Trump, which is part of a broader agenda for economic growth.
Trump’s actions have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists, who are concerned about the health impacts of the increase in emissions.
According to the EPA’s website, breathing without ozone “can impair lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the person in charge of ISIS had also sent building components of the bomb to Sydney.
It was suspected that the bomb was intended to be taken to the plane on July 15, but the company stopped before security checks.
The police did not give any details as to why the operation was stopped.
The second plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device that emits toxic colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport.
Australian Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday due to suspected terrorist plans.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will also be continued.
Managing Director of Liquide: Renewable fuels were doing well
Oil refiner Nestee's earnings before taxes fell, but hit the forecasts in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievosen, the company made a good result in oil products, sales of renewable products rose to record levels and the business profit development of the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year’s comparable operating profit was improved by the U.S. Blenders Tax Credit.
According to Lievosen, the operating profit of renewable products remained at a good level this year, thanks to higher sales volumes and more favourable markets, even though the tax relief ended.
The implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and our growth projects and will be able to complete the strategic investments we have previously announced in 2017, Lievonen said in a statement.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatchenko discuss a possible match at their first meeting
Vasyl Lomatchenko and Mikey Garcia, who are expected to face each other for the first time on Thursday in a collision course towards the next interesting boxing competition of the under 66.7-kilometer series.
The men were in their own rooms at the ESPN sports channel’s Los Angeles offices until WBC’s undefeated lightsaber champion Mikey Garcia walked down the aisle to greet Lomachenko, the WBO’s top-of-the-range champion.
On Saturday, Garcia won the Showtime with the unanimous decision of former world champion Adrien Broner of four weight classes, after which Garcia and Lomachenko have been among the top five on the list of boxers of different weight classes.
Garcia held out his right hand and asked, "How's it going, Master?
Good luck in the game!”
Lomachenko will defend his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday.
When the pair posed for photographers, Lomachenko’s manager Egis Klimas noted that the men’s match would be “perfect in size.”
"I'm a former plumber," Garcia recalled.
"I went to the top of the series [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small to 63.5 kilos.
I'd like to get back to the light.
He's got to get up to his light weight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Let's fulfill their wishes."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Football needs this game."
Klimas asked if the match should be organised on a payment channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomatshenko, according to which Lomatshenko made his debut in a light fight later this year and will play next summer for Garcia (37–0, 30 in a row) against Forres and for Litsia in a draw.
"The match could be on a pay-per-view channel because the fans have asked for it," Garcia said, and later announced that he was ready to play on a channel that offers the best prize package.
“We are the most interesting names.
No one else is paying as much attention.
I'll be fine as soon as we get the deal..."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as an "unbelievable player" and that he was going to go see the game on Saturday.
Lomatchenko interrupted Garcia's sneezing and said that this three-weight champion from Riverside looked "really slow, sorry, Mike... but you needed that punch."
Garcia said he was focused first on showing the force of attack and then on boxing.
The men said they felt that the struggle between them was to be realized more and more strongly.
“This is the game that is expected.
No other match will attract as much attention and interest.
I’m definitely involved in this,” Garcia said.
Lomatchenko said he expected to be able to compete against the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's going to be a great game."
An average of 5 300 euros, the education that is affected - the investment advice situation was "wild and free"
The quality of investment advice has been talked about a lot lately.
Most recently, Helsinki’s Sanomat told about Ritva, 68, to whom the bank’s investment advisors spoke full-blown when selling investment products.
The rules on the sale of investment advisors and various investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The intensifications are based on the new Financial Market Directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the assessment of the skills of investment advisors and employees who sell investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
The law does not specify the requirements for knowledge.
The Financial Sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the investment service carry out its own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has authorized the organisation of the degrees to APV-investment degrees for a company called Oy, whose doctoral thesis group is based on experts from both the Financial Supervisory Authority (Fiva), universities and industry operators.
The degrees are from 12 to 15 credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, Aalto University Executive Education Oy, which provides business management development services.
Its website states that, in general, both tests are "quite extensive in terms of requirements".
The study material for the degree includes 10-15 books as well as a number of other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV-Investment Studies Ltd, says that the pass percentage of tests is roughly 70.
Most of the employees of the largest banks have completed either an APV1 or an APV2 degree, as they are required to perform according to the company’s own rules.
Then there are smaller banking businesses without mentioning the names, whose staff seem to have mapped out the completion of the degrees, says Savikko.
According to him, such banking transactions are "changed".
According to Saviko, since 2000, the APV1 certification has been carried out by 13,000-14,000 people and the most demanding APV2 certifications recommended for investment developers are around 3,000 people.
Some banking companies consider it to be an advantage to pursue a degree.
More and more other industries have considerably more stringent knowledge requirements.
Savikko says that the Financial Sector Recommendation requires the completion of APV degrees, because that is when the investment-related expertise is ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, on average, financial and investment advisors earn several thousand euros a month, including commissions, natural resources and profit margins.
The average working time for monthly wages is about 5,300 euros.
On average, men who work in positions earn an average of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,900 per month and women over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,500, respectively.
The top ten earns an average of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,100.
The top ten earners earn more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9,000 per month or more, while the top ten earners earn <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6,400 or more.
Investment advice under the Investment Services Act can only be given by an authorized company.
So far, self-regulation has been relied upon at the employee and task level.
According to Fivan, the audit was carried out in individual cases where the professional skills and qualifications of the investment advisor were not sufficient on the basis of the activities of the advisor.
In principle, the seller of investment products can also act, even if the professional skills and qualifications are at a decent level.
From this point of view, the situation has been wild and free.
More and more other industries have considerably stricter knowledge requirements, says Savikko.
According to Saviko, from the beginning of next year, this will be achieved through the new Financial Market Directive (MiFID II).
It requires that each company is responsible for ensuring that the personnel providing investment services are sufficiently competent.
Financial supervision, in turn, has the power to determine what needs to be done.
Marko Hovi, Fiva’s market supervisor, says that one of the clear changes so far is the legislation on the expertise and experience requirements of investment advisors and sellers of investment products.
According to Hovin, the new requirements apply to both the investment services companies’ own staff and the affiliates who sell products on behalf of a company.
Hovi says that according to a proposal by the government of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva gets the authority to determine the skills and experience.
What exactly they are, will be decided with these views in the coming autumn.
The company must also continue to provide the necessary training and, if necessary, follow-up and supplementary training.
All this must be documented, and the company has a duty to demonstrate that this has also been done.
Hovi points out that in practice, the company must, for example, map the personnel's operations at the individual level.
This will certainly come at different levels of demand, depending on whether it is investment advice or the sale of products.
According to Hovin, there is also a new requirement to work with someone more experienced in the event that knowledge or experience is not at a sufficient level.
That is, if a company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with the person who meets the criteria for a certain amount of time.
According to Hovin, with the change, the rules are tightened and concretized.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.
Image: 787 Dreamliner passenger plane "drawing" a giant plane over the United States
The flight route of the aircraft was drawn to the United States via Flightradar24.
The flight was carried out on Thursday with the 787 Dreamliner, which Boeing tested the durability of the Rolls Royce engines on a long-haul flight.
A plane departing from Seattle flew for 18 hours and 1 minute on a 15,700-kilometer journey, which is longer than any of the usual commercial scheduled flights in the world.
The flight remained within the U.S. border for the entire duration of the flight.
It flew through a total of 17 states.
Imatra’s blue-eyed beach schoolchildren don’t miss the rain or the sunshine - Iines Kaikkonen polski blue-eyed with the help of swimming pool
Iines Kaikkonen progressed well, Taina Itkkonen followed.
Imatra’s beach gyms will run in Liette and Lempuka this and next week.
Even though it sometimes rains and then reappears, young swimmers are not even moxis, says swimming school drawer Taina Itkonen.
In this week’s swimming schools, a total of 13 children are being bullied, next week’s tenth.
The number of children in the coming week was affected by the fact that the school and kindergarten are already starting, estimates Itkonen.
The Imatra Beach School is organized in cooperation with the Movement for the Unity project and the city of Imatra.
On Thursday, Lietteen’s swim had a nice atmosphere.
The sun set and the young swimming schoolchildren trained to stay on the surface with the swimming pools, someone already without.
There were also smaller sisters in the water.
Iines Kaikko, 5, first thought to go deeper into the water.
Taina Itkonen, however, encouraged him to pulsate towards the beach.
It's going great!
Iines Kaikkonen said she visited a lot of swimming this summer.
He's a good swimmer.
Like the swimming village of Iines Kaikkonen, Vili Huhtanen, 5.
You too can be satisfied with today’s achievements, the swimming pool encouraged.
Jami Kallio, 4, once again wanted a water war.
His daughter Anna Villberg, 6, who followed the swimming from the beach, Ilona Villberg considers the beach school as a good start for learning to swim.
Although the weather has been what happens, Anna likes to go here every day.
Sometimes I had to warm up.
The swimming school kids packed up on the boat.
The boys had enough fun with the strawberry found on the beach.
Milja Luukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread to the ships towels, pruned the fruit and toasted the day.
In the water, the teaching continued, but the boat was not considered to be in a hurry.
One that doesn't belong in the summer.
An unknown soldier is being sold toilet brushes - "Here's some sort of unifying story"
You can see all kinds of things.
Sinituote, a manufacturer of cleaning products, launched the series Unknown Soldier a few days ago.
So we're going to have some dishwashers and washing machines, and we're going to have a "wc-bar with a border bar."
In this autumn, an unknown soldier refers to his first-night movie and the marketing of a leff.
Yet there is something special about the combination, and the products have been irritated on social media: When will the unknown health routes come?
You have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino M<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>t<0xC3><0xA4>, Managing Director of Blue Products, say?
We are the film’s partner.
We are supporting this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, says M<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>tt<0xC3><0xA4>.
According to him, the products come with a special introduction to the movements, and the film thus gets visibility.
Isn't this a little bit funny - often when you think that products and stories associated with them have something in common?
Yes, here is a similar story that combines that we are a Finnish actor and these are Finnish products, says M<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>tt<0xC3><0xA4>.
According to him, the company is in favor of the same Finnish basic values as those who have seen the old Unknown soldier.
And cleaning is not foreign to the military culture, he notes.
Other partners of the unknown soldier film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, Hartwall vichyt has been introduced, for example, which can be found under the names Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unknown products are already listed by Finnish photographer Kalle Kinnunen.
Coffee and clocks are also available.
Kinnunen points out that there is still time for the first night of the film, so the continuation is still allowed.
Unknown partners have not yet revealed their war products, such as Valio, Jalostaja, Neste and the German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
The results of Sweden’s asylum seekers’ age tests were published
The latest results of medical age tests for Swedish asylum seekers have been published. The results of tests carried out using the new assessment method reveal that more than 80% of the tests were determined to be over 18 years of age. However, not everyone believes the tests are reliable.
The Swedish National Agency for Jurisprudence began testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was assessed that it had failed to determine the actual age of the applicants who claimed to be underage, and that it was not possible to assess the age of asylum seekers.
The Immigration Agency has so far carried out 6,880 tests, and the Agency for Legal Medicine has now published 2,481 test results. The tests were carried out between mid-March and the end of July 2017.
Eighty percent of those tested, i.e. the 2002 asylum seeker, were found to be over 18 years of age. In addition, in 25 cases, the Agency determined that the test should be "possibly 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the asylum seeker is "possibly under the age of 18".
The tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to doubt the age indicated by the applicant.
Johan G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson, from the Agency for Legal Medicine, reports that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
“The numbers are quite consistent, and the big differences in the statistics of the previous months are not noticeable,” he told The Local.
Although most of the applicants were found to be over the age of 18, this does not necessarily mean that the applicants would have lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases there were "referencing that the investigator is 18 years of age or older".
When Svenska Dagbladet examined the same results, it was found that in 243 cases the applicant had openly stated that they were 18 years old this year.
The medical age assessment method used in the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of the knee. Then dentists and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticized.
One of the suspects is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Carolina Institute, whose work includes an assessment of people’s biological maturity. The assessment can be used to determine whether a person has had a ruptured normal sooner or later.
“I’ve had to think about it, and I don’t think the method used is the right one.
Determining biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t determine the age for sure, we shouldn’t pretend that we can,” he told Metro newspaper.
However, G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson of the Agency for Legal Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of determining a child to be an adult is low.
The risk is greatest in a situation where the test must soon be 18 years old. Then the risk is about 10 per cent."
The Joy of Falling 30 Places in Scotland
In the third round, Mikko Ilosen spent 30 laps with a score shot down in the European Tour of Golf in Scotland.
Ilonen went to 11th place on Saturday, but was found to be 41st place at the end of the round.
Ilose got together in a difficult few with three bogies, one double bogie.
Others were difficult, too.
The Englishman Ian Poulter rose to the top with one under par lap, even though he said there was enough work to keep the umbrella.
The brush was raw, but the cracks were involved and eventually the day was good, Poulter's thumb.
He shares the summit with his compatriot Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
West Virginia's governor changes the party's name
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening that he would change his party at the Trump campaign event.
“The Democrats simply rejected me,” Justice said.
“Today, after many prayers and in-depth reflections, I can tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as the governor of the Democrats.”
The general public took a break from the popular protests.
"Tomorrow he will be a member of the Republican Party," Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time for a new game.”
Trump promised earlier that a significant announcement would be made at the West Virginia campaign event.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points because Justice did not back Hillary Clinton's Democratic nomination.
Justice was elected governor in 2016, and according to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in the state.
He inherited a mining business from his father and owns coal mines in five states.
The value of his assets is about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement saying that "the exchange of Governor Justice's party is once again a new blow to a democratic party that prefers to build barriers than a better America."
“Democrats have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this case, Justice’s announcement is the latest return to a party that has no leadership whatsoever and is unable to find a positive, people-to-people message,” Ronna McNeil, RNC’s spokesman, said in a statement.
Salamat baths damage - Thursday coming up to the very rainy day of summer
Over the weekend, more owls will be added to southern Finland.
During the past week, it has rained particularly in the central and northern parts of the country, as well as in the region of Varsinais-Finland.
Between Wednesday and Thursday night, several fires were set on fire by the Salamanians.
According to meteorologists, Thursday may be the worst day of the summer so far.
The Ukkoskuru have also finally found Finland.
During the past week, there has been a flash of lightning, especially in the central and northern parts of the country, as well as in the region of Varsinais-Finland.
While sitting, a flash of lightning struck the power center of the rivital, causing a small fire.
The rescue agency received a notification of the blaze on Wednesday afternoon.
The power station was located in the sauna area just outside the rivitalo.
The rescue agency dismantled the roof and the wall to find the fire pockets and extinguished the fire with a whiff.
A total of eleven apartments were left without electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
On the holiday, the light again ignited the exterior buildings in Harjulan before half-time.
By the time the rescue facility arrived, the building was already in full fire, and the rescue facility could only prevent the fire from spreading.
The 50-square-foot building burned to the ground.
In the direction of Kuopio in R<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>kkyl<0xC3><0xA4>, a lightning strike hit the house again.
The inhabitants of the house were outside the building and witnessed a flickering flash of lightning.
The rescue agency was on the scene to check the case, but this time the light didn't get past the fire - only a few cracks cracked.
In traffic, the mooring caused problems on the railway between Sein<0xC3><0xA4>joki and Vaasa, when the Salamanca damaged the traffic control system.
The error was reported on Thursday morning between eight and nine, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was resolved just before 5 p.m.
Since then, rail traffic has continued normally also with a narrow section of rail.
Salams have been wreaking havoc across Finland.
However, the salami has been relatively low this summer.
This summer’s thunderstorms have been absolutely stunning! says meteorologist Jari Tuovinen from the Finnish Meteorological Institute.
The midweek and Thursday thunderstorms have been mostly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the low intensity of the summer, it also feels very strong.
This might seem like a really tough one, but that’s what it has been compared to this summer’s one, Tuovinen says.
On Wednesday, the landmass climbed 1,700 times, and on Thursday has had the potential for even the harshest day of summer: by about 4 p.m., there were 1,790 landmasses on the site.
If the lightning still continues on the side of the start, then you can reach over two thousand lightning, Tuovinen predicts.
The previous record-breaking leap year was tested in 2015, when the flash of the year was about 30,000.
By Wednesday, the number of lightning this year had risen to 18,386.
So it is still important that this year does not violate the “record” of two years ago.
However, the owl can wait for it to continue.
According to Tuovense, the air above Finland will also remain warm and humid during the weekend, which is an ideal birth environment for the deaf.
The main weight of the victims will be shifted to Saturdays from the northern parts of the country to the south, where about 2,000 Salama days can be obtained on both Saturdays and Sundays.
In the central part of the country, a more uniform alignment is permitted.
According to Tuovense, only a handful of people are snoring.
Coe praises Russia's "open-minded" apology for doping scandal
The World Athletics Association, Sebastian Coe, applauded the apology he described, which Russia made on Thursday because of the doping scandal, but Coe added that it was not yet time to end Russia’s ban on participation.
Russia’s General Sports Director Dmitri Shljahtin told the IAAF Congress on Thursday that Russia’s ban is appropriate and that he intends to fight against doping deliberately.
He said he was sorry "for all the athletes who were traded in the gold or silver medal competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of continuing the ban. Russia was shut down from the general sports competition in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report had presented evidence of state-backed doping in Russia.
“I think his response today was very direct, it was a very open-minded presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The whole Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian General Sports Federation admitted to going through difficult times and announced that it would do everything in its power to reorganise its activities.”
Coe said he was also "satisfied" that Russia accepted the terms of the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendation of the working group that now is not the right time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
“In the coming months, we will have to do everything we can to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes compete on the status of a neutral athlete in the World Championships in Athletics starting Friday in London. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF Task Force, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its position can be restored.
"The test is still insufficient, and the trainers who have been banned from operating are still functioning freely," he told reporters on Friday after a presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
The production company disappointed with the poor success of the Tom of Finland film
The Tom of Finland film did not become as successful as the actors hoped, says Yle.
To be honest, I am disappointed to admit that the director of the Helsinki Film produced the film, Annika Sucksdorff Yle, in an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film got its first night in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached a fair 100,000 viewers, which is on the film's budget, about five million euros, compared to little.
There was no lottery win, but now it is important for investors to get their own back.
If the film had been better in the country, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for small bites from outside the distributions, Sucksdorff says.
Tom of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karukosken.
How football’s economic rules affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The restrictions on the use of funds by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving from Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain, France, the most expensive player of all time.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, which regulates European football, which can prevent teams from participating in the esteemed Champions League.
In 2011, UEFA introduced a fair game of economic rules, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar’s move has been financed without major losses.
Barcelona was paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million for the conclusion of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar’s annual salary in the new association is in the tens of millions of dollars.
Neymar's move to France involves a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar’s transfer fee and attaching him to its schedule, as a result of which it finances the Qatari oil-rich ruling tribe.
The clubs may spend large sums on players’ acquisitions, but they must be balanced with real sources of income so that the football-related business is not a loser.
The rules of the fair game were drawn up on the initiative of Michel Platini, a French national, who was elected UEFA president in 2007.
As a former footballer, Platini believed that the goal of success by borrowing was fraud and led to serious problems if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the focus of the fair game's economic rules shifted from the debts of the clubs to their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time at Chelsea in 2003 made it much more difficult. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player acquisitions and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of the fair game's economic rules will run until 2018. During this time, the sequels will be able to make a maximum of 30 million euros in losses.
Although Platini was forced to leave the role of UEFA president in 2015 in a scandalous way, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, also wants to control the unfathomable use of money by the clubs.
“The rules of the fair game are still in use, and we will apply them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the fair game’s economic rules at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG paid Neymar out of its contract with a one-time compensation, it may keep the amount in its accounting for the entire duration of its new contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded as an annual expenditure of EUR 44.4 million for the next five years.
Based on the rules of the game, the first penalties were awarded in 2014 and the largest penalties were awarded to PSG and Manchester City, which was financed from Abu Dhabi.
PSG received a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million, which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million. In addition, the club was ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the period 2014-2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is looking at clubs that may attempt to circumvent its economic rules by increasing their income through companies related to the owners of the club.
For example, if a Qatari company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, UEFA will not count the aid as a real result.
This is what happened when UEFA decided in 2014 that the Qatari tourism authority’s support for PSG was over-represented.
It has also been revealed that some of Neymar’s earnings at PSG could be funded by Qatar’s 2022 FIFA World Cup Organising Committee with fees available.
However, PSG and the Organising Committee have banned Neymar from being an ambassador for the World Cup, and it would be very easy for UEFA to disclose such an arrangement.
As a result of the previous PSG sanctions, UEFA is more likely to follow the company’s rules.
Sources familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not negotiated with PSG the transfer of Neymar.
Sources gave an interview to the Associated Press news agency on condition that their identity is not revealed because they do not have the authority to discuss the PSG situation.
According to the most recent published financial statement, PSG’s net sales for the period 2015-2016 were EUR 542.4 million and net profit over EUR 10 million.
The financial statements of the last year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to attract new sponsors and increase sales of follow-up products and game shirts.
The Commission estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 % under the Neymar Agreement.
The Spanish league, which was clearly upset by the departure of the best player in the world, tried to complicate Neymar’s move, which was alleged to violate the economic rules of a fair game.
“This is a clear economic doping case for both the club and the state,” Javier Tebas, president of the Spanish league, told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the Qatari ownership of PSG in the country.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is also on a reserved basis for the state to fund the activities of the football club. Arsenal is owned by an American sports boy.
"The incident is a result of ownership that has changed the football operating environment completely over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“Everything is possible after the state owns a football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with the economic rules of the real game. There are so many interests related to the fact that the famous player represents the state."
Now it's a rush: Finland's World Cup athletes coach trapped in Helsinki
Arttu Pajulahti and Kristiina M<0xC3><0xA4>kel<0xC3><0xA4> coach Suren Ghazaryan are stuck in Helsinki, even though he should train at the World Cup in London.
Kristiina M<0xC3><0xA4>kel<0xC3><0xA4> may have to compete without the advice of her coach.
Pajulahti will compete tomorrow in the long jump and M<0xC3><0xA4>kel<0xC3><0xA4> on Saturday in the triple jump.
However, the trainer of the duo, Armenian Ghazaryan, has not received a visa to Great Britain.
Ghazaryan has tried to deal with the matter in the British Embassy.
The coach has the invitation of the organizers of the World Cup as a document, but has also not qualified for a visa.
Whether this is the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, said training director Jorma Kemppainen.
He has always handled visa matters successfully himself in the past, but now there are some problems.
He'll do anything to get there.
Ghazaryan has worked for the Finnish Sports Association SUL for many years.
It's not that big of a deal.
As soon as someone looks at the stadium for signs, Arttu Pajulahti said of his coach’s possible absence.
MM-mittal from FinlandLondon demands a miracle
The World Championships in Athletics will begin in London on Friday and will last until the end of the fair week on Sunday, August 13.
General sport, cross-country skiing and ice hockey are the kinds to which Finnish bench athletes are able to approach passionately from year to year, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of baseball players, success is measured in metrics.
There are other gauges, of course.
Less attention will be paid to the beautiful growth stories of young athletes from valuable to valuable, where the experience of gaining the experience will mature the athlete’s performance to the level that the adult MM medal is truly possible.
Now there are no such young athletes in the small World Cup team in Finland, and yet there are no competitions.
The MM-mittal for Finland demands a miracle.
Fortunately, the interest in sports and the surprise is that miracles can also happen.
It pulls the bench players to the side of the TV screen and glues them to follow the dice, even though the London medals are solved due to the time difference only in the evening.
Finland won one of the previous World Championships in Athletics in 2015 with a bronze medal.
It was brought by the thrower Tero Pitk<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>ki.
The fans are still waiting for the medals from Pitk<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>e, even though the results of his and other throwers’ recent performances and the stay of the long run in the last summer’s championship.
In any case, Pitk<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>ki will remain in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
Access to the final competition or making your own record for the other Finnish skiers is a good enough performance.
The hope and belief in the realistic milestones of Finnish general sport in the coming years will give a good success in the international values of young people this summer.
The processing of young talent and the financial support of its work is more important than keeping up with a small elite team of representative athletes.
Success does not come in a moment, but requires years of hard work from athletes and patience from both preparation and bench athletes.
The Finns are also able to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performance as well.
Hopefully, the London races will be left in history in the guise of Usain Bolt and Mo Farah, not for example because of fear of terrorism or violent attacks.
Before Rukaj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi as second in Copper's big air - "But yes, it's sad"
Snowboarder Enni Rukaj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi is ranked second in the big air race in Colorado.
The second runner-up at Copper Mountain is Rukaj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi’s best big air in the World Cup.
The women's kite was won by American Jamie Anderson.
Rukaj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi scored 147 points in the competition.
He tried his last jump in the caballerial 1080 for the first time in the kites, and it was very close to succeeding.
It feels good and a good feeling is now, but it’s a shame that the last jump didn’t go at all.
Yeah, I'm going to try it from now on in the kites, too, you little Rukaj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from a jumper made for the species.
Viking Line's new fast-boat sails to port in Helsinki
Viking's new fast-ship FSTR is badly behind schedule.
The fast ship was to depart from Helsinki to Tallinn at 6 p.m.
In eight countries, loading was underway.
The ship arrived in Helsinki late.
At least an hour and a half I've been waiting for you to get to the ship.
Now the car line is moving a little bit, the Estonian Johannes Rebane, who is waiting for the ship to arrive at the port of Helsinki, said at 7.30 pm.
Rebane assumed that the new ship had become a technical fault.
Rebane said the shipping company had brought in water bottles waiting for the ship to arrive in his car.
Viking communications chief Christa Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nlund tells IS that there was a technical error.
It was repaired at the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nlund says the ship will also be delayed for a couple of hours on the Tallinn return route.
The ship had to leave Tallinn back to Helsinki at 20:15.
42-meter special transport interferes with traffic on the Sixth Street on Thursday evening
The 42-meter-long special transport runs from Muuko to the port of Mustola on Thursday night.
Transportation departing from 9 am is expected to arrive by 11 pm.
The police control the traffic on the Sixth Street, and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
From M<0xC3><0xA4>lki<0xC3><0xA4> the transport continues along the 13th road to the port of Mustola.
Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective - Wet Hot American Summer
At the same time, the story chronicles both the 80s and 90s grunge days of the characters (at the time David Wain and Michael Showalter did a brilliant sketch series for MTV) and their own time – in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the rest of the series were cast.
As a cultural product, it is both a parody and a description of the continuous memory that we have been stuck in during the Facebook era.
As a commercial product, it feels like it is already alive.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (among other things, it was described as the background story of the vegetable speaking with the voice of H. Jon Benjamin).
At the heart of the joke is that middle-aged actors are acting like someone who is close to full-age. Emphasis on it makes some jokes about the impossibility of reaching the past.
Ten Years Later, where adults act as adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more divisive: it parodies, for example, 90s stalker movies, such as the horror film Hand That Rocks.
In one point, one of the characters digs out the Apple Powerbook, inline scrollers, and "Change the Earth from 1991".
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has not yet gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And in one crazy game, he joins Ronald Reagan (also Michael Showalter) as his crime partner, George H. W. Bush (played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are sidebars.
Especially fun is to see the young Paul Rudd, who has a snitch under his pillow or Matt Dillon's "soul patch" from the film Singles. Rudd's acting Andy, the camp shoe, begins to be an old mom.
Moments of random madness may lift this series into flight as a sort of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. On its last episode, the team of friends goes to the Wet Hot American Summer movie premiere.
Amazon’s Comrade Detective series draws on a different nostalgia: the Cold War spirit of The Americans series, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW series of push-ups where the West meets the West.
The comedy series was created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and directed by Rhys Thomas, and has been made into a Romanesque 1980s police drama in which a Bucharest-based couple fights for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
The main characters, Gregorina, and Iosefina, are Flori Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, who have been dubbed into English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
But much else is not.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (police spend time watching chess on TV in the same way that Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny.
However, Comrade Detective is too attached to the plot of the social drama – there is, for example, a killer hiding behind the Reagan mask. That’s why the series often begins to feel like a real villain from propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough and not rich enough.
As the series is tightened, it could work better as an agitprop satire, even if Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and there are always two fat men in the lobby sucking on hamburgers.
The message to the imagined communist public is that Western culture can make everything consumable and fast food.
The imaginary Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: as a rich man, we are rich in our own history and their own history.
Kouvola’s Toni Tauru will rise in a circle in Macau on Saturday – against former UFC player
Toni Tauru wants to keep the game going.
Toni Tauru gets a tough fight in Macao, as Brazilian Leandro Issa played last year in the UFC.
The Brazilian also has a jujutsu black belt and a world championship of the species.
I'll fight myself against my parents once.
It's a fun story, says Tauru, 32.
The Kouvolain was due to return to Indonesia last Saturday.
The match was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three matches were scheduled for the Chinese self-governing region of Macao.
Tauru has never faced such a thing before.
This is the first time my game has been cancelled.
It irritated, because preparation and training took a lot of time.
However, the player is pleased that a new time has come for the match.
Waiting for a week doesn’t have much to do with preparation.
The transfer does not affect the condition, as it does not occur immediately in a week.
The condition can get even worse if you are exercising too much.
In a few previous fights, Tauru has faced opponents, whose strengths are being set up.
This time the situation is different.
My father-in-law describes himself as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive player.
I'll bet he'll come on hard in the first row and try to take you to the mat.
He's won the jujutsu world championship, so he knows the pressure.
The previous match of Kouvola did not go according to plan.
Filipino Kevin Belingon hit Tauru badly in the eye, and the win remained for the Philippines.
I’ve never played so well, especially since he didn’t get a hit.
When I went down, he hit my eye.
It's been bad for a long time.
New Motivation
Some libertarians take part once a year, some of them go up more tightly.
For example, the upcoming opponent Issa played for the last time in September.
Last year, the club had three games.
This is the second battle of the year.
At times, the pace has become heavy.
I’ve been training and being in good shape all the time.
However, I've only played because of the game.
When the 32-year-old heard about the upcoming encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo training and got the joy of doing it back.
We got really good training when one of the guys from Sweden was there.
The training was a great help, because on Saturday the Kouvola has to prepare for physical struggle.
I have been able to train against similar opponents and practice standing up.
Being able to play is a 32-year-old main tactic.
You have to hit it rationally.
If there's a chance, I'll take it to the ground myself.
Exports must not be given free of charge, as they consume the most.
Macau also attracts the Taurus previously taken in China.
I've heard of China in Las Vegas.
I think it's a great and great evening.
The Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to announce that it will keep interest rates on track when economic growth has been relentless and inflation has stopped speculation about interest rates.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue at a slow pace, with the Bank shifting interest rates as more pressure is placed on the income level of families.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s monetary policy committee voted 6–2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 per cent, and this month the increase in coronation received even less support, as economic growth has been tireless.
In its quarterly inflation classification, the bank lowered its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7 per cent and its 2018 forecast to 1.6 per cent. It also warned that more pressures are being placed on the household income level, as inflation is expected to continue to increase rapidly.
According to the bank, however, interest rates will be needed in the coming years to curb Brexit-driven inflation, and the bank has also announced that borrowing costs may have to be increased more than expected in the financial market.
In addition, the members of the committee decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package, which was implemented a year ago in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will end the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, even though it is now expected to provide preferential financing to banks of <0xC2><0xA3>15 million more, i.e. a total of <0xC2><0xA3>115 million.
The Bank's interest rate protocol states: "According to the forecast of the Monetary Policy Committee, the slow development of gross domestic product will continue in the coming years as the decline in real household income reduces consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Bank reiterated that in order to control inflation, there is a need for "somewhat tightening of monetary policy" market expectations "a little more broadly".
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that the potential increases are "gradual" and "limited".
In May, the bank forecast a growth of 1.9 per cent for this year and a growth of 1.7 per cent for next year.
It now maintained its 2018 growth forecast of 1.8 per cent.
The pound weakened against the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
The pound against the dollar fell by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31. It fell by 0.4 per cent against the euro and was EUR 1.11.
The decision to keep interest rates in mind was made after the expected weaker growth rates muted the increased expectations of interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3% in the second quarter and by 0.2% in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter but to rise slightly at the end of the year.
The latest inflationary breakdown gave little hope for accelerated inflation and low-wage households, and the bank said the situation would deteriorate even before it became better.
The Bank added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the fall in revenues in the coming years, but it expects wage development to recover "significantly" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong increase in demand for British products as a result of the weak pound, which will cancel some of the impact of the private consumption bill.
The decision was made a year after interest rates were calculated at 0.25 per cent after the shock of the EU referendum, which hit the pound.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to start to appear in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Prior to the latest decision by the central bank, interest rates had started to be called up more and more loudly when inflation was under pressure for households. In July, three decision-makers called for a 0.5 per cent increase in interest rates.
Inflation fell to 2.6 per cent last month from 2.9 per cent in June, but it was expected, and inflation is tightening again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the two-percent increase in the target level was due to a "total" weak pound.
“Given the recent decline in swap interest rates, competition in the housing loan market would seem to be tightening even further as lenders hotly seek customers and want to end the year strongly,” said Coreco Mortgage Brokers CEO Andrew Montlake.
"Markets look particularly good for those whose current loan agreement is coming to an end. Renewal contracts are even more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also cost-free options available."
NHS Approves 10,000 Controversial HIV Medications
Starting from September, patients can be prescribed a "reversible" anti-HIV drug. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute regarding the funding of the drug in the UK's public health system (NHS).
The NHS has reported that pre-exposure contraception (PrEP) is prescribed to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. Prior to the combination, it has been found to reduce the risk of infection by about 86 percent in high-risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to fund the trial after the court upheld the highest court ruling last year, according to which the NHS is able to pay for PrEP, even though it claims that local authorities should fund it.
The head of the NHS, Simon Stevens, called Thursday’s announced decision “a remarkable new intervention,” and the national AIDS organization described it as “a crucial moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to receive registrations for the trial, which will be extended to other clinics in October. The trial will reach its full extent in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure contraception (PrEP) should be taken before joining an HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV infection in risk groups.
Before the drug is taken, it means that there are enough drugs in the body during the combination that prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgender people, as well as people with HIV-positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
The clinics choose the conditions for the trial to meet applicants from men, women and transgender people, as well as those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for his or her disease.
People who live in England and have registered for a general practitioner’s care can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The program costs <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and the English NHS signed a procurement agreement this week after the international tendering competition.
The purpose of the trial is to assess the potential of PrEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its targeting, taking and implementation.
“This significant new intervention should complement and enhance existing diverse and increasingly effective ways to prevent HIV,” says Stevens.
"It is yet another significant achievement in the ongoing battle for more than 30 years to solve the greatest health challenge facing humanity."
“This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV,” says Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Organization.
"If PrEP is properly targeted to those who need it and are at risk, it can have a reversible effect on the UK HIV epidemic.
As of September, those in the risk group will receive a drug funded by the NHS, the use of which they can decide independently without the need to negotiate with a partner. It has a strengthening effect that will improve the lives of a very large number of people.
This was welcome news.”
“The most important thing now is to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly across the country and that no one in the risk group remains outside it,” says Ian Green, director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
“The PrEP drug used in the trial has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect tens of thousands of people at risk from HIV infection.”
“The launch of the PrEP trial is a welcome event that has been unnecessarily prolonged for several months due to the government’s slowdown,” said Shadow Government Health Minister Sharon Hodgson.
“We have evidence that the drug may have a counterintuitive effect on our work to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this dangerous disease.
The experiment will help us to understand even better the real benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the trial be launched as soon as possible across the country, so that we can protect those who are exposed to HIV and get a step closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has managed to stop."
Quality of life: mid-layer and fixed interior solutions have made a small Earl's Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former real estate repair banker, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is the queen of the Anna era on the first floor of the stylish house. The success of the renovation tells us that Joanne has not yet spoiled her fights and changed.
“I used to live with my ex at Knightsbridge in a much larger apartment,” Joanne says.
“I was looking for something similar in my price range.
I went here at the apartment display and noticed that the rooms were as high as in my apartment at the time.
I loved it and made an offer the same day.”
Since then, an apartment of about 90 square meters has undergone a complete transformation.
It was a double room, where the bedroom could only be accessed from the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and the middle floor, so that the room height could be used.
“I wanted space, large windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands,” he said.
He hired Erfan Azad from the Duck & Shed planning office in Notting Hill, where Erfan was tasked with taking advantage of the space of almost four meters high and creating an apartment that would not only be a repair and sale site but a home.
The room height was not quite enough for two overlapping spaces, so the challenge was to build an intermediate floor where you could stand.
The solution required creative thinking from Erfan.
"The steel structures are quite complex.
The rooms had to be arranged on top so that they did not need to be padded.
The structures had to be adjusted in such a way that the height is just right, both above and below them."
Erfan was able to place two full-sized rooms on top of the space with fascinating details.
In the middle floor, Retrouvius’s copper-crystal window opens into a stylish living space.
The sophisticated furniture, silver accents and the vintage lamps of Serge Mouille create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, a sense of space and light.
The mirrors at either end of the short passage make the passage seem longer than the real one.
The mirror in the middle of the kitchen is like a window, from which the view of the other room opens.
The entrance mirrored furniture has storage space for Joannen’s aerim and glassware.
The elegance is enhanced by the fact that the kitchen can be hidden when not in use.
Kitchens equipped with a folding door are not a new solution,
But Joanne’s kitchen is unique in that the door is raised in the same way as the car garage door.
“It took a bit of design,” Erfan says of the steel-reinforced MDF door.
"It is balanced, that is, it slides when lifted very easily into place."
With the use of the space and the design of the storage space, Joanne received 16 additional squares, a second bedroom and an even better floor solution.
“When selling an apartment, the surface area solves – or the valuation of the property,” Erfan says.
"In the original case, the real estate agent walks into the apartment and calculates the price based on the surface area."
In Joanne’s apartment, the surface area was added using high-quality materials that bring luxury to the space.
“The occupant is in touch with the materials of the apartment, and emotions in the apartment arise partly based on them,” Erfan says.
“No one sticks to the electrical wires running on the walls.
They are important, but not the same way.”
Joanne's apartment is an example of the fact that good design and extras can make the basic apartment exceptionally nice.
Then it can also happen that you no longer want to move out of the apartment.
The pregnant princess Sofia radiates in her summer looks
Princess Sophia's choice of residence was shattered.
Princess Sofia represented Sweden in B<0xC3><0xA5>stad for the last time before her birth.
The princess of the event A Sustainable Tomorrow had chosen a light blue dress for the evening.
Sofia represented on the occasion with a smile.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited B<0xC3><0xA5>stad, Sweden, this week.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia represented A Sustainable Tomorrow seminar in a stunning blue body-suit that beautifully clothed the last pregnant princess of hers.
Sofia arrived at the event in a dark blue residential complex.
This is the last event in which Sofia will represent before she is born.
His estimated time is in September.
For the evening of the event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress, which went down wonderfully.
The style was crowned with large earrings and a stylish little purse.
The pastel blue dress is beautiful to the princess.
Sofia has been on a representative journey this week in B<0xC3><0xA5>stad, Sweden.
Sofia's full of living in a little corner.
Sofia directly radiated in her fresh summer mood.
Sofia was passionate about the event even talking to the photographers.
Now I'm just holding my stomach, Sofia laughed and referred to her final period.
She's raising us with sweet chili
In the summer of 1996, a home appeared on Lahti Square, where Thai food was sold.
The villagers did not dare to taste it, but walked past it.
In the kitchen, the food was sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttil<0xC3><0xA4>, known as Panja.
He didn’t know much about Finland, and the Finns didn’t know about Thais at the time.
Because the people did not dare to go to eat, Panja offered free tastings.
This is how he taught the lazy ones to eat the bread of spring at one time.
Land the land, he said.
I'm stuck in a ditch.
I went more and more, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened his shop in Lahti.
It had two small tables, the customer seats should be under 20.
He taught us not only to eat a loaf of bread, but also to sit next to a waiter.
When there is hunger and places limited, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
We got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, I sat next to the board with a dictionary learning from Thai.
Two years went by the store management side, but then the restaurant had to change, because the spices themselves I heard smelled too much in the hall.
A new place was liberated from the end of the trade administration.
There's room.
Now we lawyers will be able to sit at our own tables again, only in the busiest times we will have to ask the guests if there is room next to it.
Panja knows his client.
He'll be told where he's been and who's been seen.
He knows what each person eats.
He has seen how customers’ life stages change and the food chain changes.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first spring solstice.
He remembers me as fat and fat, and he remembers how young I was.
It’s nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, to sit at my place next to the kitchen door and exchange the dishes with the leaning Panja.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationality with a sweet chili paste.
He has opened not only our tastes but also our thoughts and our hearts.
Nowadays, many people speak him Thai - thanks to the growing popularity of tourism.
I love Panjaa.
Even though he's had a hard time, he's always friendly.
He's tough.
On top of the restaurant work, he goes to the pig and the mustache.
Last week, the restaurant celebrated the anniversary of the two-decade anniversary.
We got our customers a dessert of strawberry cake.
Without alarm or attention, this significant day passed, by the side of the work.
The discovery of the underground base revealed 173 ISIS terrorists who were ready to strike in Europe
From the beginning of the year, the security authorities received a significant list of counter-terrorism activities.
The list contains more than 170 information from an ISIS fighter who is ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are a total of 173 people and the document contains not only their personal data but also photos of each.
Of the more than 130 people on the list, more than 130 are Iraqis, but six are also Europeans.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The evening message told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and the information it contains have been refined.
According to the newspaper, the special forces of the Iraqi army found the personal data and images of the terrorists as they examined the terrorist organization’s underground base in Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence agencies assessed the authenticity of the papers and forwarded them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European country security authorities in May.
There was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in the West by terrorists after the fall of Isis in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, in addition to the names and pictures of all persons, the list also includes their date of birth, invented sub-fields and information about the person’s country of origin.
Special areas for terrorists are also included in the list.
For example, a 27-year-old German on the list, Sami J., reads the fighting name Abu Assid al-Almani, a German.
He is said to have left Germany in 2012 by traveling first to Egypt, then through Libya and later through Turkey to Syria to join the ranks of ISIS.
In addition to his image, a suicide bomber has been written as a special field.
There is no more accurate information about a man's fate.
A total of around 6,000 fighters from Europe have left the ranks of ISIS, whose fate is uncertain.
The man was lying under the surface in Helsinki’s shopping area.
According to interviews from the rescue agency, the man had wanted to show that he was able to swim.
Even a stranger can save a dying spirit.
A man was rescued in Helsinki’s Tokoinranta on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, the fire station of the Helsinki rescue agency, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found underwater about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The rescuer found him under the surface, Estlander says.
The rescue agency received a notification after half past four in the afternoon.
The person was delivered into the hands of the first care.
Estlander says he was about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, the man had wanted to show that he was able to swim.
The situation on the shopping street is over.
Estlander would like to thank the authorities for their cooperation with the Border Patrol and the police.
This was the task of the Border Guard Agency.
The locals also guided the divers very well.
It was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water along with the Border Patrol and the police.
Two passenger cars collided in Euro - nine people in cars, three seriously injured
There were a total of nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered milder injuries, says the daytime fire master.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred at the intersection of three roads at four times a day.
The collision occurred when another car turned around behind the warning triangle in front of another car, says the daylighting fire master.
According to the rescue agency, the crossing area has a speed limit of 80 km/h.
The brothers fight for more than $500 million in real estate
Two brothers argue about Victoria's largest real estate empire, worth more than $500 million, and the dispute is connected to their Italian family 40 years ago to set up a family business.
Colin De Lutis, former chairman and real estate developer of the Carlton Football Association, lives in the Toorak area just three blocks away from his younger brother Paul. A younger brother has taken to the highest court a dispute between the brothers about real estate and business ownership.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter argument about the difference.
Together, the brothers and their mother, Anna, own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, and the family began to accumulate wealth when they bought a business as an adult at Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family founded there the Westco Jeans store, which expanded into a chain of 160 movements.
The chain was sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was spent on real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller, as well as shopping malls in suburban areas.
According to an agreement with the family's late father, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul describes his father as "the strength and central character of the family".
According to court documents, the property distribution ratio means that Colin owns properties worth about $316 million and Paul’s worth of about $176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
“I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal,” Paul wrote in his first affidavit to the court in 2015.
The case was dealt with last Friday for the first time in the Supreme Court after several conciliation firms.
The brothers are now also arguing over who controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has shut him out of the business.
According to Colin, the claim doesn't hold true, and he's accusing Paul of mishandling some properties.
Colin writes, together with his first wave of evidence, that he would like to come to a solution.
“According to our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing to me,” Colin said in a statement.
The costs of the case are constantly increasing. There are hundreds of fake statements, emails and reports. The case is being investigated by consulting companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who founded milk bars and confectionery shops in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a trade in Brunswick.
They were used as collateral when the family bought a property from Collingwood, where Colin founded the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he founded the store "in the last years of school, when Paul was a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer the properties to their boys in a suitable way.
“Luigi often stated that he did not want the brothers to end up in court,” Anna writes in her statement.
The family's two other sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis group's business. According to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke spent $26 million leaving the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are “crackers of the economic conditions of their departure.”
Colin has kept a low profile, although he is a former member of the Australian Football League board and TV star Eddie McGuire’s best friend according to the 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Luti and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin answered, and he said in his text message that it is not possible to comment correctly because it is being dealt with in court.
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to challenge me to the court and bring our family to justice,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to agree to his brother’s demands.
“Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way,” Colin continued, adding that he still hoped that the matter would be resolved.
On Friday, the hope seemed to be gone.
“Our cases will be resolved in court in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to limit the president’s media use.
The others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First of all.
According to Poltico, the White House’s new chief of staff plans to limit President Trump’s media use and follow-up to news so that the boss doesn’t get into so much trouble.
Publisher Josh Dawsey reported:
“When the White House’s new chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with the executive on his first day of work, he addressed a key problem he’s going to solve: he’s going to restrict President Donald Trump’s access to information.
Kelly told the White House employees that all information – both printed and heard in the media – must be conveyed through him, because the president makes better decisions when he gets good information.”
Kelly’s words make sense, but others have tried to limit Trump’s media use and failed.
President Trump has a decades-long relationship with television – and as president, he’s still watching a lot of television.
“If President-elect Trump was nervous about the unfair news, it would seem to him that the sympathetic media treated things more evenly,” Sam Nunberg, who worked as an adviser to Trump’s campaign, told Politico in February.
Politico reporter Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “according to six former campaigners in charge of Trump’s Twitter use, it is essential that his personal media stream includes a steady stream of bodies.”
All right.
But it’s ridiculous to say that Trump’s use of Twitter would have ever been under control.
Maybe these campaigners know something that we others don’t know – maybe Trump’s tweets would have been even crazier without their efforts.
We probably never get to know what kind of messages Trump left without sending.
If even a few times his staff have been able to prevent him from causing problems, their work has not been unnecessary.
No one, however, has been able to consistently prevent Trump from causing the coup.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to run their affairs by providing Trump with information that supports their views. That information can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisers intentionally provide the president with information on the subject.
Editor Shane Goldmacher said of one case:
“Trump’s current and former employees say he can be irresponsibly angered by the newspaper outlets that criticize him – especially if they tell him about the harmful data years. Then he has to find out where the data came from.
That happened at the end of February, when someone accidentally gave the president a copy of the news site GotNews.com, founded by Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused Katie Walsh of several White House intelligence leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter due to harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and later canceled them, and he also did not provide concrete evidence.
Despite this, Trump had started the conversation after reading about the Walsh staff.”
Goldmacher added that then chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "had tried to introduce a document management system for Trump."
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still running their own affairs.
These immutable facts make Kelly's job very difficult.
Neymar signs five-year deal with PSG
Brazilian star Neymar has signed a five-year deal with French football club PSG, the news agency AFP reports.
Earlier Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid a draw price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million to FC Barcelona, who played in the Spanish league.
Neymar's contract with Barcelona was therefore broken, and he was free to move to Paris to PSG.
The maximum transfer amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in football history.
The record was previously held at Manchester United, which paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million last summer from Frenchman Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by state-owned Qatari company Qatar Sports Investment.
The club is chaired by a former tennis player, Nasser al-Khelaifi, from Qatar.
Neymar is expected to arrive in Paris on Friday.
Success writer Raija Oranen explained with hypnosis of alcoholism and flight horror: "I'm fine with my life"
From the TV series Ruusu era and Pure White Stripes, well-known success writer Raija Oranen spent just his 69th birthday.
Hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
In addition to writing, five children hold mummies, with Raija and her husband Jyrki giving up the Spanish sun and Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winters.
At first they sold their house, but now in the spring also went to a rental apartment.
To the light and the sun, away from the old circles, Raija in time took the depression and alcoholism from which he has survived.
The outer body is 20 kilos lighter.
The weight started to drop when the serotonin drugs were discontinued, they were mind-boggling drugs.
I got help with alcoholism in time from hypnosis, which also stuck in the airfoil, I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years.
Alcohol takes a person, the radiant writer says openly.
Raija and Jyrki Orane have been on the same journey for over 45 years.
I can do better than ever.
Jyrki Orane, who has worked together in the tourism industry, has been together for over 40 years.
I kissed, and it was getting married in two weeks, Raija laughs.
Such a drama queen he has always been, having ended his life for that, Jyrki laughs at his wife.
Made by a large writer’s magazine, Orane only remembers the good 44 parts of the Clean White Stripes TV series, which touched and moved the lava-time in Finland.
I finally decided to become a part of the company of the Raikka family in the clothing industry when I read Liisa Sepp<0xC3><0xA4>l<0xC3><0xA4>’s 50th anniversary interview on the plane.
I was a walker’s daughter myself, my mother also had a clothing movement and I sometimes acted as a mannequin, Orane remembers.
From him the plot and story of the series changed the attitude of the Finns to entrepreneurship.
Anita Savelainen's research and argument revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer of active time, he has many manuscripts under the work - ideas of hundreds.
The tourists returned across the river to the "millions flock"
The wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again in the hairpins with self-contained tourers, who managed to cross the town’s required lane and return to the fields next to the houses.
Around 20 people parked their caravan near the street called Solihull, which is a multi-million dollar street.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they were able to cross the town's highway to cross the valley, bringing with them children, horses, and an army of vans.
The cyclists managed to cross the road at a point that had been left unprotected due to the track.
The angry residents have accused the municipality of Solihulli of "perfect inability to solve the problem".
An unnamed resident tells us that the tourers arrived Monday evening from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown passers-by with stones.
“The customer has to work hard because it feels completely incapable of solving the problem.
The tourers were here in May, then they left but came back again.
There were more of them tonight and probably more of them today.”
Asukas said that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to parks.
“I live on Streetsbrook Road, and it’s disappointing to pay a municipal tax when the city can’t do anything about it.”
According to the second unnamed resident, it is ridiculous that the circuitians returned so soon after they were driven out.
"There are more of them in the past, and they've even let the horse crawl into the park."
According to a Solihulli municipality spokesperson, the municipality is aware of an illegal camp near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with Solihulli police to destroy the campers as soon as possible.
As far as the collection of evidence is concerned, it is very important that as many locals as possible report to the police about disturbing or criminal activities.
It will help to create an overall picture of the situation for legal proceedings."
Enraged people surrounded by Portugal’s storm machine
The men who were forced into forced labour on a beach in Portugal have been questioned in court today.
Two people were killed yesterday as a result of the forced payment.
Two men who flew the plane could be charged with the production of death.
At the very least, you can get 16 years in prison in Portugal.
Yesterday, due to a technical error, the men's flying machine had to make a landing on the Sao Joao da Caparica beach near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the incident, some of whom ran a plane to escape into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The plane first hit a man who was on a sailboat.
Immediately after that, the plane went up and when it landed again, it hit the child’s head, told the newspaper Filipe Janeira Jornal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents were not injured.
On the beach, the soldiers surrounded the small machine immediately after the crowd in anger.
The girl’s father and other people went to the plane and began to chase it, the case was reported in the Celia Rocha Correio da Manha newspaper.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It is a wonder that no more people are dead.
Two men on the plane were not injured in the collision.
The Finnish star who lost her legs tragically won the World Cup again: “Without an accident I wouldn’t be a world champion”
Matti Suur-Hamari celebrated early Wednesday morning Finnish time World Cup gold banked in the slalom in Canada’s Big White competition.
In the past, Grand-Hamari also won the Cross World Cup gold.
In total, three World Cup titles have already been collected.
It's an incredible time for the World Cup!
Two times gold was treated, quite in a good cycle is drawn, the telephone reached Grand-Hamari rejoiced.
The 30-year-old skier congratulated his coach and the successful preparation in Finland.
According to Suur-Hamar, the number of challengers in the species is constantly increasing.
The whole of the parachuting has grown and developed a lot in recent times.
The differences are decreasing, and there are a lot of new triggers involved.
I always wondered if there was a black horse.
Every race seems to be a different winner.
Grand Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been enthusiastically down from youth to youth with his friends, and the accident had not taken away the desire to get to the slope.
From time to time, let’s remember what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that there is no need to play.
Those cards are played, which are dealt, Grand-Hamari emphasizes.
It would be a cruel title track for a serious accident and losing track as a way of luck, and not for the Great-Hamari to do so.
But he turned to the hard work.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned out to be a win.
I wouldn't be a three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old's biggest boat wreck was already sinking.
Towards the top of the shower, we started to do real work only after the accident.
When I was young, I trained with friends, and we were always excited to kill X-Games.
But they were distant dreams that lingered for some time.
After the accident, I found myself somewhere from the start of X-Games.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old, and I thought this would be a really long life if I stayed here to grieve and grieve.
I decided to pull the hoodie up and start working.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The rider was very pleased with the selection of Leo-Pekka Star as athlete of the year.
The four-time Olympic winner received his award in the sports gala held in January.
According to Suur-Hamar, the victory of the Star is an important signal for the Paralympics.
It was a big deal, and the win was definitely deserved.
This will also open your eyes to the world of basketball.
When is it time to launch the double world champion Matti Suur-Hamar’s Sportsman of the Year campaign?
You'll see it in time.
I try to do my best to succeed.
Yet the Great Hamar has not conquered all the tops of its charms.
Next year is a big goal.
After a year, the Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
We're going to go get some medals!
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently unless the war ends and ISIS leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study looked at the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees burning bread in a refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian youths do not believe that they will return to their homeland permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of ISIS from the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
The Trump administration does not see any change in the Syrian conflict.
The Burson-Marsteller chain of communications examined the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in an international study.
Burson-Marsteller has been studying the views and attitudes of Arab youth for nine years.
This year, the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study looked at the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, a total of 400 Syrian youths aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half of whom are men, responded to the study.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees do not believe they will return to their homeland permanently in the future.
42% of respondents thought they would return to their country of origin and 4% could not say.
According to the study, the young people’s decision to return home is most affected by the ongoing war in Syria and the presence of ISIS in the country.
Nearly half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most influential factor in the permanent return home, while the most important one, according to the fourth, would be the departure of ISIS from the country.
Only less than one-tenth of the country’s economic recovery or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria are the main factors influencing the decision.
Military action does not resolve the conflict alone.
The Syrian youth was asked what was the most important factor in the resolution of the conflict.
The majority believe that ending the war is more important than the resignation of President Bashar al-Assad.
Al-Assad's presidency is seen as an obstacle to a peace treaty.
Almost half of them feel that both political and military solutions are needed to end the ongoing conflict in Syria.
The only way to resolve the conflict is by military action to believe that it is a fair quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugee youth see the power of Isis weakened in the last year, while a fifth experience its strengthening.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against ISIS, and generally against terrorism, is that the media would give people information that ISIS has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many put military measures and education reform as the primary means of action.
According to the Tenth Amendment, the most important thing would be to create better jobs for young people.
When asked about the impact of the Trump administration on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump administration.
Nearly one in four believe the Syrian conflict will worsen during the Trump era.
Opinions are divided into two on whether the involvement of Russia and Iran has improved or worsened the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time coding to keep the Internet in order - his developed database uses, for example, Wikipedia and Google
The Spanish company MariaDB is developing the "world's fastest growing" open source database.
Coding entrepreneur Michael "Monty" Widenius's MariaDB main product does not cost users anything, and it can be developed online by any advanced programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of data reports, huge data masses remain in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
“All the information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked there,” explains Widenius.
Widenius, the technology leader at MariaDB, spends about half his time coding.
The man who makes beautiful hand-to-hand remotes takes care of the fact that the internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world’s most popular open source database, MySQL, along with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, technology company Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion, and a year later Oracle’s software giant Sun for $7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade took place, a large number of MySQL developers announced their departure.
“They didn’t want to work for Oracle, which didn’t give a firm promise about the future of MySQL,” Widenius recalls.
He had already founded a company that began to develop MariaDB at this stage.
He didn’t want his life to die.
I hired a couple of top developers from Sun and made sure that the continuity of the code was secured with the help of the same friends who created it.
Because MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change my name.
The Foundation was established to monitor the development of the MariaDB code.
"During mySQL, these checks were not made," Widenius mutters.
While many have heard of Widenius and MySQL’s billion-dollar trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
“In recent years, our growth rate has been around 50 per cent per year,” said Kenneth Paqvalén, CEO of MariaDB.
The growth-focused MariaDB is not yet making a profit, and Paqvalén is a niche in the company’s credentials.
In addition, he reveals that in the current financial period, MariaDB estimates that it will receive orders for EUR 20 million.
Since the database is free, the company has developed around it services that business customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be a career over a year if the customer has used a closed database.
Switching from MySQL to MariaDB succeeds instantly because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, Spanish operator Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica and the largest bank in Southeast Asia DBS are MariaDB’s paying customers.
The most popular cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba Cloud, provide their customers with MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically distributes to new users in Linux operating systems, where MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we are a small company, we have connections to the biggest players.
“Our customers include the world’s largest telecom operators, gaming companies, banks and even the central bank of the river,” Paqvalén said.
The database market is still dominated by giants like Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, and SAP with their closed databases.
For Oracle, MySQL is a modest side-by-side business compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
While research firm Gartner says that the largest database companies have lost their market share in recent years, in terms of revenue, games like MariaDB are still intact, although rapidly growing.
In the approximately $50 billion database market, open source databases do not exceed even a billion.
However, the weight of the open source code can not be measured only in cash, because most users do not pay anything for these software.
Research firm Gartner predicts that in 2018, companies will already develop more than 70 percent of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been switched to open or at least the transition would have begun.
Big companies don’t get new customers, because most choose the next open source code.
This has led to the fact that licensing fees for commercial databases have skyrocketed.
Companies want to make as much money as they did with a smaller number of customers,” Widenius thinks.
Since it is difficult to change a closed database, most of the customer companies have been listening to price increases.
“There are a lot of customers that have a really hard transition because their old apps and others are stuck in a closed database,” Widenius says.
He still believes that the measure of customers is coming to fruition.
When license fees rise every year, the customer will sooner or later move to an open source database.
The price is 10-20% of the previous one, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if they wish.
Moreover, many companies are faced with major system changes when they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many change the database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received a EUR 25 million loan from the European Investment Bank from the EIB.
It was the largest growth funding ever granted by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is now planning to hire more.
One of the reasons for the EIB’s funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
The company has public sector customers in the UK and Germany, for example.
The public sector in Europe pays billions of euros annually from databases.
“Many countries want to move to open source solutions and thus use tax havens more effectively,” Paqvalén says.
Widenius laments how money is spent on closed health care systems in Finland, when open systems are cheaper and the customer is not at the mercy of one software company.
Some say that open source is an ideology, but I think it’s a better way to make code.
The community helps and does things that it can’t invent or can’t do.
Widenius, 55, is one of the most well-known open source developers in Finland, Linux developer Linus Torvalds.
Widenius helps other companies to develop functional business models on top of open source.
I still hold 4-5 speeches every year around the world on this subject.
Italy to tighten its stance on civil society rescue vessels
Italy has warned NGOs on its ships to rescue refugees in the Mediterranean Sea that they will not be allowed to continue their operations unless they commit to comply with new rules on their operations.
“If NGOs do not commit to a new policy, it is difficult to see how they could continue their activities,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with La Stampa newspaper in Turin.
Minnitt's warning came the day after the Italian authorities had hijacked a German aid ship, the Jugend Rettet, whose crew allegedly cooperated with smugglers who promoted illegal immigration.
The aid agency, which has been operating for only one year, refused to comment on the detailed charges brought against Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, saving human lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area,” the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can only assess the allegations once we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the Iuventa platform of the Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected of taking on the ship by boat refugees directly from human smugglers who were recommissioned by the boats.
One such case is alleged to have occurred only a few kilometres from the Libyan coast, and the information is shown in the prosecutor's document, which has been published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have threatened the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area. The motive is considered to be the spirit of assistance.
According to the operating instructions, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who supervises the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to follow the guidelines: Save the Children and the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that it considers new rules to be unnecessary but acceptable as they do not cause "significant changes or obstacles" to the organisation's rescue operations.
Among those who refused to comply with the guidelines are the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders.
Minniti, for his part, noted that the number of migrants arriving in Italy in the last few weeks has fallen sharply, which he considers to be evidence that the actions to strengthen Libya’s coast guard and cooperation with local city leaders are beginning to produce results.
"In recent days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He revealed that there are plans to continue discussions this month with the Libyan mayors on economic development projects, as well as with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees heading towards Europe.
A seasonal worker suspected of having died in Enonteki<0xC3><0xB6>, a suspect was found on the ground - a case to the prosecutor
The alleged crime took place in Enonteki<0xC3><0xB6> Kuttasa last December.
According to police, a 36-year-old Czech man is suspected of killing his 26-year-old Scottish counterpart.
Previously, it was reported that both were seasonal workers.
Police have also said that the suspect had fled the country with two dogs after his act.
The man was found frozen from the field, and he did not resist when he caught him.
The case must be brought within a week.
The case may be brought before the Lapland District Court in August.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Robert Hardy is Dead
British actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
The actor's death was announced by his family on Thursday.
Born in 1925, Hardy began her acting career at the age of 24 in theatre.
During his long career, he also acted in films and television.
Hardy is particularly remembered for his role in the Harry Potter movies and for his role as an animal doctor in the James Herriot television series All-Haired Friends.
The BBC’s most popular series was described in a total of seven.
Michelle Carter Sentenced to Prison for Text Messages That Succeeded in Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for texting and phone calls that she was found to be infatuated with her boyfriend Conrad Roy's suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, is serving 15 months in prison and five years in probation.
Carter was sentenced to death in June, and his boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said at Thursday's hearing.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter applied for a change in the sentence and was able to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was threatened with a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffer from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream-colored sweater, listened to his judgment on the cross with a crying look at the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"He decided Conrad's life to improve on his own.
He has not taken responsibility for the act," the prosecutor continued.
"He hasn't shown any remorse."
Carter’s lawyer said the case was “due to the shocking circumstances that Carter deeply regrets.”
However, Justice Lawrence Moniz was of the opinion that Carter’s “at the age or maturity level and not even mental health problems had a significant impact on his actions.”
The prosecutor read a statement from Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, in which she said that "it will not take a day for me to die the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I can cope with all of this, and I try my best to comfort his sister in this pain that we will always endure."
Conrad's sister, Camdy Roy, told the court that she was "worried" about the idea that she would never see her brother's wedding or be an aunt to her children.
“It’s painful to lose a person who has been in my life every day since I was born. That pain never hurts,” Camdy said.
The incident appears to be a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that says that committing suicide is a crime.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in a car after being hit by a chicken in 2014.
The incident drew national attention when it became apparent that Carter had in his text messages persuaded his boyfriend to commit suicide.
“Shut up, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don’t know, there are many ways,” Carter wrote in many messages he had sent to Roy during the two weeks before this death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just before Roy's suicide, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter got attention with Roy's death, and the judge ordered Carter not to benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared the views of experts.
Only a few have defended Carter. One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's statement, stating, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary-General: Russia's worst conflict since Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But, especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Russia’s continuing instability in the eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to working so that tensions do not escalate to their peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid the escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s comments, U.S. President Donald Trump may have found that the U.S.-Russia relationship was headed even to a dangerously bad level.
Trump urged to thank the country’s poor interests for the Congress, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Audi makes changes to 850,000 diesel engines due to the experience of car manufacturers
The day before Audi’s announcement, BMW offered to update more than 350,000 car software.
BMW’s manager said the company believes that “there are more sensible options than driving restrictions” and he referred to European cities, including BMW’s hometown of Munich, which are considering restricting or banning the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies spoke about the recall.
European car manufacturers have been strongly promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to achieve the CO2 emission targets.
Emissions of nitrogen oxides from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emission-neutral equipment will increase, making it difficult for cars to be competitively priced.
German automakers are being closely watched, and Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of complicity with big car companies and sidestepping problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s mistakes. Volkswagen installed cheating devices in cars that reduced emissions in accordance with the regulations tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, but the executives’ actions are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the engine development department of Audi was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be extradited to the United States for possible trial.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. Authorities suspected that Audi had installed in its cars a system that could circumvent Europe’s emissions requirements. The charge was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
Audi’s investigation could significantly weaken Volkswagen’s position: the luxury car manufacturer’s share of Volkswagen’s profits is disproportionate.
Venezuela's vote began with a false investigation, large demonstrations in the
According to the company, the number of voters notified by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role in the outcome of the elections, said Tibisay Lucenan, chairman of the National Electoral Board.
Maduro announces the end of the crisis
On Sunday, Venezuela voted in a controversial referendum to change the country’s constitution.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and has organised demonstrations against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be on the run at the time of the appointment.
According to the El Pais newspaper, the country’s national security forces began to take control of the country’s parliament building on Wednesday evening.
The purpose of the teams is to ensure the safety of the designation.
Climate change threatens Provence lavender
Laventele has become a symbol of the Provence region of South France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Laventel had been reduced due to drought and disease-carrying insects. Researchers and farmers are trying to find a solution to the problem hotly.
“Laventeli is a direct threat in the Provence region, as it has suffered the effects of climate change in recent years. Thanks to them, the amount of rainfall in spring and especially in autumn has decreased significantly,” says Provence, a specialist in agriculture.
"This reduces the lifespan of the lavender.
In addition, the drought has brought in a lot of small cascades that spread microbacteria."
Bets are hard.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a very popular ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
“Rather than long stars and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers that are poorly developed or weakened or missing altogether,” Chaisse says.
“In other words, the parts that contain essential oil are even less.”
The solution is sought by increasing the efficiency of irrigation, slowing the evaporation of soil moisture and spraying plants with a mixture of sap and water, in addition to the development of drought even more sustainable varieties.
Reporter's murder reveals growing threat in Mexico
The Riodoce newspaper, which appears once a week, usually meets on Wednesday to discuss how the newspaper deals with the latest cases related to organized crime, corrupt officials and the endless drug war in the state of Sinaloa.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Publishers are encouraged to change their daily routines.
Two experienced suppliers are discussing which one is safer: to leave the children at home or to take them with them to a delivery that was hit by a grenade attack in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on the front panel of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask suppliers for names in each group. Evidence is not needed, observations and feelings are sufficient.
The table lists the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected to be on government or drug cartel payrolls, who are criminals who make the chaos of Mexico life-threatening news.
According to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto took office in December 2012. There have been 589 attacks and threats in the protection of the Federal Republic of Cuba.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder of Riodoc, a journalist and a source of inspiration.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
He is desperately needed, even though he is present everywhere. The facade of the Riodoce building is covered with a huge picture, in which Valdez shows the middle finger. In the picture reads: "Justice". Thirty-something journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in t-shirts, with a collar on their sleeves, with collars on their sleeves
The meeting will be held less than two months after Valdez's death, and the journalists will discuss his shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fears of being overwhelmed by the persecution.
In 2010, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office was established, in particular, to deal with the cases of journalists, but so far, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two charges have been raised.
Publishers’ killers are rarely brought to justice, as well as thousands of murders related to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, only rarely end up being dealt with by the law.
Riodoc’s journalists plan to continue writing about Sinaloa’s violence, even though they are deeply saddened and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the safety test is of little use because the killers are not aware and there is no hope of justice.
“This meeting is a waste of time,” he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know the cause of the incident."
Valdez had left Riodoc’s delivery in the state capital Culiacan on the morning of 15.5.2017.
He had driven on his red Toyota only a couple of blocks away, when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The number presumably related to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it some distance away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was survived by his wife and two adult children.
The rumours move quickly and float freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death is a mouse accident.
Sinaloa has been the bloodiest battlefield in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. Competitive groups want to fill the void.
On the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are shot to death on a daily basis, and the cemetery has two-storey, two-storeyed buildings that are larger than many homes.
A state on the coast is “relaxable” when only one cartel controls ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and leader of Riodoc, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published an interview with Damaso Lopez, who leads a competing group that is at war with Guzman's sons.
It may have been the case for Guzman’s sons: customers suspected of being members of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine came to the points of sale.
The second mistake was that Valdezia was not forced to leave the country after the second newspaper published the same story was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer be afraid of him.
He had made a long career in Noroeste when he decided in 2003 to start with five colleagues in Riodoca. The magazine's shares were sold at that time for $50.
“It was impossible to do journalism without dealing with a drug problem,” Bojorquez says.
Over time, the magazine began to feel bold and honest about its stories, and its sales and advertising grew.
Publishers appreciated the opportunity to publish hard-class investigative journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by stories in the magazine that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its innovation in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage to follow the story of the Mexican drug trade without realizing it.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said when receiving the journalists' protection committee award.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is a "way of life", Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“The publisher must take on the task that falls on him – or play dumb.
I don’t want anyone to have to ask me where I was when I was bathed in here – why didn’t I tell you what was going on?”
Riodoc’s staff is in need of Valdezia, a spell caster who cursed like a port worker. They are in need of a friend who was always given grace and advice. They are in need of a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routines.
He was always wearing pancakes.
He went to the opposite El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were up to his fate.
The death of a colleague has also made them think about how they can best do their job and stay alive.
“The rich don’t like it when we deal with their wives and children and their pure business, their secret drug trade thank-you paths.
They were left out of things,” Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant strong self-esteem and self-protection.
Trust in your own instincts.
If you feel that everything is not there, you have to stay away.
The problem, according to Andres Villarreal, a Riodox reporter, is that “the impact can be deceiving, and that’s what happened in Javier’s case.”
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, nor do they apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to be brought to the room where Riodoc’s security training was held. A few days earlier, it had become clear that only spy programs sold to governments had activists and journalists followed in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had sought shelter in the shade of the tree from a 40-degree streetlight.
The state government had ordered them to guard Riodoca's premises, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class Culiacan area.
Some of the journalists assessed half of their games as to whether it was these two police officers who were among the 50 percent that the governor of the state did not consider to be reliable.
It had already been months since the journalists had visited drug gangs in the mountainous countryside.
At this week’s issue, Riodoc’s delivery drew up three main issues.
Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinaloa.
The newspaper also intended to reveal that the government’s money use had focused on the governor’s hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan’s most expensive restaurants, just a block away from the prosecutor’s office, was kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information about who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to proceed with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in the favor of both drug dealers and authorities.
The publisher found out from the public documents that the restaurant had been registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has managed Mexican politics at all levels for almost a century.
The governors involved have recently been accused of corruption in cases where there has been a lot of publicity.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the previous cases in the same place. One of them "El Chapo" Guzman's son managed to escape and avoid the army race.
A few months earlier, readers would have known they had received reliable information about the abduction from Valdez’s column.
“We’d already known what had happened before,” says Villarreal, 46, who has been given the nickname “El Flaco”, Ohukainen due to his body structure.
"Now all the connections to our data sources are gone."
Valdez’s working room has been transformed into a warehouse that stores anti-smuggling banners and stickers for journalists. The magazine’s employees have been given a new, unexpected task: they have become activists driving freedom of the press.
Miriam Ramirez, a journalist, took a couple of signs with her as she left the next morning in front of the local prosecutor’s office for a protest, which was again the cause of the murder of a new journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n three days after Valdez's murder.
After the fall, a burned body was found, which is based on DNA tests done by the authorities on Adame.
Publishers have begun to protest more loudly across the country. In demonstrations on pedestrians and buildings, the text "SOS Press" appears.
Today, Bojorquez is in Washington, D.C., where he is seeking international support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
On the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez met with the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He has since requested that he be removed from the affairs of the government, because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in his hatred.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that in Mexico, journalists were surrounded by organised crime, the authorities that allowed crime and an indifferent society.
In his last book, Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs kill journalists, but they are also killed with a crime organized in agreement on the orders of politicians and security forces.
According to the Article 19 supervisory group, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by police and authorities.
“In Mexico, people are silenced by killing,” Ramirez says.
Murder has a devastating effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Next to his body was a message signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my writing."
Next to his severed head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to stop their activities, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern state of Chihuahua, after the March murder of mail-exchanger Miroslava Break.
Some of his activities continue, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although his manager was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Some of the journalists have fled their states or all over the country.
The decision is difficult.
It’s hard to find a job on the ground and you have to be on guard all the time.
Criminals sometimes look for the reporter in their hands, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinos, who was murdered with four women in a apartment in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was supposed to be a poet at the time, admits that writing about the drug trade is scary.
“I became a reporter because Mexico is going to hell,” he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce’s reporters sat down on Friday at midnight in front of the delivery with a beer on the street, when the magazine’s latest number had been completed. Suddenly, their phones began to color as a sign of a message.
The shooting between competing gangs and security forces at Mazatlan's beach resort killed 19 people.
The war accelerated, as was promised in the messages of the cartel found in the area.
The publishers put the news on Riodoc’s website from the footpath with their smartphones.
The front page had to be renewed the next day.
The sirens were hovering nearby – again a new shooting.
Bojorquez looked at the police officers guarding the delivery:
if they were afraid, they covered it very well.
Riodoc’s delivery continued the tradition of the magazine’s murdered founder under this massive figure, in which the man shows the middle finger to the entire Sinaloa.
Bojorquez says he can't even consider quitting. "How could I stop the newspaper when our coach asked me to get out on the street to do it the same day Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Mannisen Olympic project started with a huge backlash - "Hard place"
The 39-year-old Hannu Mannisen’s celebrations were short-lived, as the professional pilot began preparing for the Olympic Games.
However, the training period began catastrophically when Manninen became ill with the flu.
It started with a long period of illness, which lasted for almost five weeks.
In practice, May went completely ill.
At first there was a flu and finally a childhood disease like an ear infection where I had to eat an antibiotic cure.
I was able to do only 10 percent of the planned exercises.
I don't remember the last time I was so sick.
It was a hard place when I didn’t get used to training, Manninen tells Ilta-Sanom.
Testicular collapse
The 2007 World Champion was only given a training permit in the second week of June, as seen in the KIHU Ball Test at the Race and Top Sports Research Centre on June 12.
In the test, the athlete skis with roller skates on a mat, the speed of which is increased every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the mat stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a lactic acid sample from the athlete’s fingertip on the neck.
Last fall I spent 32 minutes on the mat, but now I only stayed 28 minutes.
It came against the wall, Manninen says.
In the better direction
After the initial difficulties, Manninen tells us that he is staying healthy.
I’ve done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises that I’ve tried to normalize the body’s metabolism.
Now there is a really good five-week period.
The celebration was also a half-week holiday from the morning of the flight.
I am also able to go to the cottage with my family.
Last season, Manninen competed in only four World Cups before the Lahti World Cup.
The best result was seen immediately in the opening competition, when Manninen rose to the top 18.
Guideline watertight
Mannini and national team head coach Petter Kukkonen have made a comprehensive training and competition plan until next February.
We are now looking for a different rhythm compared to the last period.
After the first round, Ruka had three World Cup weekends.
In December, the goal would be to participate in at least one World Cup weekend, perhaps in Ramsau.
By the end of January, plans should still be in Seefeld.
Hopefully after that the name will be found on the Olympic team list, Manninen says.
The Pyeongchang Olympics would have been the sixth Winter Olympics for Mannis.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City in 2002 a gold team competition celebrated the number-one downhill.
Dinosaur Protects From Enemies by Masking
At first, it looks like a scary duck.
Now, the researchers have revealed the first research results from a Canadian miner’s discovery of a cornea-sized creature that had been so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that the researchers were able to even determine that its fine skin was reddish brown and had a "problematic past".
According to the journal Current Biology, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur of all time and the best representatives of its species in the world.
The most recently discovered fossil is nodosaurus, which was discovered between 110 and 112 million years ago in the mid-terms of the Union.
Researchers consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a truly significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic, the best-preserved fossil of all time is a pansy plant food.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in Northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not appear to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to investigate his discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the royal palaeontological museum in Tyrrell.
There, the forge was excavated for six years from a 1,100 kilo block.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
“If you close your eyes, you can almost believe it was sleeping,” says scientist Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Tyrrell Royal Museum.
“It remains one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs in the history of science, the Mona Lisa.
Skin studies found that meat-eating dinosaurs were likely a significant threat to this plant eater, even though it had a panssari and it resembled a walking panssari.
Its red-and-white pansari was masked by its predators, and it was also protected by a darker and lighter color that is still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus able to better blend into its environment and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old rhinoceros rose to the headlines in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers named it after Mark Mitchell, a museum technician from Borealist Mark Mitchell, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours digging the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly well that Mitchell and an international team of researchers have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body fins and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general coloration in which the body is darker on top and lighter underneath.
The observation was still a surprise, because Borealis is considerably larger than today’s animals with similar coloring.
It can be concluded that the meat eaten by dinosaurs caught it to the extent that evolution favoured hiding as a means of survival rather than a fight.
Today's animals, such as mice, sepros and armadillos, have a similar coloration. They are considerably smaller and therefore easier prey, suggesting that the rhinoceros was also seriously threatened.
“The capture of a large, heavily armored dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs of the union era were,” Brown says.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the nodosaurus fins reveals that its skin was reddish brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the nodosaurus in order to draw conclusions about its life, and they have researched, among other things, the contents of its gut to find out what it ate at its last meal.
The researchers believe that it fell when the river died and set sail to the sea, where it sank its back to the bottom of the sea.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is today in Florida, and rivers and seas were likely to reach much farther than they are today.
“This nodosaur is really important because its fine leather has been preserved and it has also been preserved three-dimensionally in its original form,” Brown says.
"That's why it looks almost the same as in the early union period
It doesn’t take much imagination to figure it out: if you close your eyes a little, you can almost believe it was asleep.”
The period of accession was an era of the theropods, giant two-legged, flesh-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannosaurus rex, or millions of years before Borealis, its great predecessors may have been able to prey on this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of Tyrannosaurus rex included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, an approximately 11.5-metre-long six-hundred-foot monster.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in the journal Current Biology. They believe that Borealopela swam into the sea after her death and was mummified by the mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in Northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011, and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world’s best preserved armored dinosaur with leather and armor from the carcass to the lochs.
Nodosaurs were an average of five metres long and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
Two half-meter spikes were raised from their plates.
The researchers believe that this pan-fried plant food passed through present-day Western Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armored personnel carrier has retained small details along with a marine grave.
Its fossilized remains have survived so well that its skin remains on the armor’s hollow plates along its neck.
Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic that such retention is "one rare thing as a lottery win.
The more accurately she looks at it, the more amazing it feels.
The hollow plates of its skull armor still contain fossilized skin.
Its right front foot is on its side, five toes up.
I can also count the bottom of that foot.”
How does an activist learn to answer the question: to whom do the streets belong?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9.8.2014.
He had arrived a day earlier in New York from his home in St. Louis and sat in his airbnb apartment in bed browsing Facebook on his phone.
Then he noticed a message from his classmates:
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and his body is still on the street."
Confused, he noticed that no one else had posted the same information to his feed, which is why he shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
His schedule included numerous retweets from <0x40>TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to a rapper based in St. Louis, who tweeted about the death of Michael Brown, a white police officer who had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street, where it was left for four hours.
"This is unbelievable," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter later that night, people were told that they were gathering on Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police closures and screaming people, as well as Brown’s father, of a man claiming to be himself, who read in the column: “Ferguson’s police just killed my unarmed son!”
Ferrell followed a real-time video in which police stood in front of protesters with a dog barking.
He says he also saw a video in which another police officer shoved his gun and shouted, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals."
"This is not normal," Ferrell recalls.
“It wasn’t the kind of murder we’re used to and could be called typical.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was angry and crying.”
He booked a return flight home the next day.
Ferrell went to see his six-year-old daughter from his father and decided to leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years has been made into a documentary film "Whose Streets?". It got its first night in the cinemas on August 11, 2017.
The film is a story of survival and expression of the mind, love and loss, as well as strength and resilience from the point of view of the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
As Ferrell drove towards Ferguson's flower dress and her compatible crown with her daughter, they again went into a discussion about "what it's like to live in black and under what circumstances." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
“Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe in?” Ferrell recalls telling his daughter.
“We’re going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that’s not right.”
“I couldn’t help but take my daughter with me,” Ferrell later said.
"The events of today are... the culmination of the events of the past.
My daughter has a right to know and grow up with it.
He needs to be prepared for activism and organization, but he also needs to know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of living in black, and he needs to know what we have to do to liberate ourselves.
Although I'm lucky to have been able to protect her from violent racism, she's still the same as the other black girls.
I feel like I would hurt her if I protected her from reality.”
Their first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, which is located opposite the police station, which became a camp for activists as they waited for information about the case and finally learned that the police would not be charged.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to the protesters.
Ferrell gradually began to approach activism in a new way.
“My activism changed completely after August 9th,” he says. While studying at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, Ferrell was the chairman of the organization of minority nursing students. At that time, he focused heavily on food law and health care.
“I had no experience with organizing.
Somehow it just happened.”
A few weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, the document’s assistant director.
Folayan said that he and photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to tell" what was going on.
Ferrell thought of a hypnotist. He asked: "Do you really want to tell what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use for?"
Against the background of suspicion, they were countless times when people had appeared in the local community, usually white, who only wanted to benefit from its difficulties and blindness.
“We had heard that there was no common voice among those born and raised in Ferguson,” Folayan said in a recent interview. “We wanted to do things differently.”
Folayan had already contacted assistant director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism with the death row prisoners.
Davis' involvement led Ferrell to join the project along with six other locals, who followed events in the years following Brown's shooting.
“This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak,” Davis said.
“The most important thing for me was how local people are portrayed in the film, because I’m portrayed the same way.”
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, because it was intended to show that in the popular movement "it is not a charismatic leader but a community"; Ferrell proved to be more transparent than what he described.
That’s why the document shows the surprising private aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as falling in love and getting married.
“I thought I was a little naked,” Ferrell laughs, telling her how it felt to see the film for the first time.
“But I understood that this work and the human depiction of blacks require a certain vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story once again brings to the fore the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was born on social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after police shot Trayvon Martin, a black teenage son, in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement are identical to the queer identity.
“The leadership of black queer women has kept the whole movement going,” Ferrell says. “It’s because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees: "The business really maintains black women, among whom there are a lot of queer women."
However, he stresses that Ferrell was not selected for the document “self-intentionally” because of his queer identity.
"He got the energy moving," Folayan says.
"It's no coincidence, though, that he was on the front line. Black queer women live at the intersection of many things, and they have a lot in play.
His energy is transferred from the white cloth.”
The news groups have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the community and the police are still busy.
Ferrelli has two and a half years left on parole, and he was convicted of blocking the motorways at the rally.
His description of the socio-political climate of his home is short and concise: "Interesting."
Yet he still relies on the slogan he learned out on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
“Our responsibility is to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our clothes.”
A suitable similarity: the artist creates images of Chelsea Manning's DNA
The Fridman Gallery, in New York City, hangs in the middle of the exhibition space faces – white, black and brown faces, between which you can more accurately observe the similarity.
These 30 works are portraits by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Manning's hair and hair.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where he was sentenced to 35 years, and Manning was convicted of leaking classified diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.
Dewey-Hagborg's A Becoming Similarity exhibition opened on 2.8.2017.
It has two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art. Manning is a trans woman and a pioneering thinker whose prison sentence was eased by Barack Obama on the third day of his term in office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA algorithmically and created 30 shape images based on his genetic data. They are sharp, albeit a little theoretical, approach to the modability of DNA data, multi-interpretation, and the causal relationships behind interpretations, as well as identity.
Chelsea Manning, whose birth name is Bradley Edward, has openly told women that she has been dating since the breakup. She was found guilty in 2013 of 20 crimes, including espionage, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning sentenced to prison: a rough, black-and-white selfie, in which a troubled mood Manning sits in the car in the driver's seat. He has a platinum-colored wig in his head, which became his hallmark.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was behind the highly popular Stranger Visions project, which he implemented in 2012.
In it, he created images based on forensic data, he got DNA data from, for example, cigarette butts and cracks, and he created pictures of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their story," Dewey-Hagborg told a news conference.
Manning was not allowed to visit, and he could not be photographed in prison, so the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked if he would be interested in making a DNA image of Manning.
The artist and his incarceration became friends who exchanged letters and wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even co-wrote the Suppressed Images series, which Shoili Kanungo envisioned, describing a future in which the president would have eased Chelsea's sentence and he would be able to watch the show.
In reality, Obama shortened Manning’s sentence only a few days after the release of the comic book, which was a lucky coincidence after seven years in a national military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will open right now, when Donald Trump goes to his own war against whistleblowers and transgender soldiers, and invents new ways on Twitter to strengthen those powerful bipartisans that he was actually supposed to alleviate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "everyone has a purpose".
On the wall of the gallery is the artist's statement and below it Manning's big name, where the point of the surname i is the heart. In his statement, the artist demands an end to "an automatic division on which gender, race, sexuality and culture are based".
On the opposite wall there is Manning's DNA sequence: a long line of C, G and A letters written on a pencil.
With this combination of 200 letters – or nucleotides, as the artist’s definition implies – Dewey-Hagborg wants to observe how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
“I hope my exhibition will help people understand that we are of equal value from our genetic heritage and that genetic data is very personal and open to interpretation,” says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition also features his Spurious Memories video work from 2007.
"DNA tells countless stories. Here are 30 of them."
The last work of the exhibition is in its own room: a page from the comic book of Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
There, Manning's character rises from the prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they make you quiet, they've won," reads the photo.
"Never be silent."
“The text is a letter I got from Manning,” says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold colors."
Unlike what was described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the show. When Manning arrives, he was greeted by his own genetic data-based faces like a crowd of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is intentional, like everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA section is written in a pencil at a height equal to its length (157.5 cm).
“The crops used to be on the wall, but I wanted to bring to them the feeling of a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to portray Chelsea's birth squad, which was also behind his release."
A professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University are wanted for the murder
Police say they have launched national searches to find a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are suspected of stabbing a man to death in a Chicago luxury apartment.
The Cook County Court documents show that on Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathe, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, suspected of involvement in Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranlea's death. Arrest warrants have been issued for a possible first-degree break.
According to documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed several times.
According to a local statement released by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on July 27, 2017.
Police alerted to the Grand Plaza apartment building found the victim with multiple stab wounds in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene and the stabbing is being investigated as a murder.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northwestern since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice-rector in charge of the University’s social relations, said in an email that Lathem is now administratively free and has been denied access to Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case that the authorities investigated, and the Northwestern University will assist in the investigation," Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a senior assistant in financial management at the University of Oxford.
In an emailed statement from the University and Somerville College, the statement said: “We have been in touch with the police in the UK and are ready to assist the authorities investigating the case in the United States in all possible ways.”
In addition, the statement said that Warren's colleagues are shocked and hope that he will give up.
Anthony Guglielmi, the Chicago Police Department's chief intelligence officer, said he is urging suspects to seriously surrender to the authorities.
“The police have an understanding of their whereabouts, and we are constantly refining our searches,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
He told police that he had received a call from the owner of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague hint that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as horrifying.
According to Guglielm, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told security cameras that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi says.
The Grand Plaza’s management team released the following statement to residents: “The police are currently investigating the course of events and the background of the victim as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence.”
The man threatened to blow up Islamic bookshop and ‘kill Muslims’ in London
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," the judge told police.
Moffatt must perform a hundred hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced for his threats to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to the Independent newspaper, David Moffatt was convicted of a serious disturbance.
According to the police, the bookstore staff alerted them to the location on May 23.
According to the staff, the man had "threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill Muslims".
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was arrested when he called the police about the threat.
The threat was not related to the book trade.
Authorities found that Moffatt was dressed in the same outfit as the bookstore suspect, a police spokesman said.
"I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic," Moffatt told police.
As punishment, a man must perform a hundred hours of unpaid social service and pay 620 pounds, i.e. about 690 euros in legal costs and 85 pounds, i.e. about 95 euros in compensation for victims.
According to a Scotland Yard spokesperson, several hate crimes are left unreported.
"We will complete the actions in accordance with the WADA roadmap in the near future" – Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Vitaly Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete actions in accordance with the road map of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to restore the powers of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“Some of the road map measures have already been implemented, and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with UKAD, the UK Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the Roadmap for WADA, which sets out the conditions for the return of RUSADA’s powers. The second part of the Roadmap was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything of concern to Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA in the near future,” Mutko added.
One point on the road map, however, requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the results of a study by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who is investigating the state’s alleged role in Russian sports doping.
Mutko said: “The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has conceded failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no state programs, and we can’t admit something that didn’t exist.”
Mutko’s remarks were echoed by Vitaly Smirnov, Chairman of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Earlier in the day, Smirnov, speaking to Russian RSport sports media, admitted that there have been problems with Russian anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that the report has controversial views and regulations.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally," he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in November 2015, when the extent of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, it was granted permission last June to design and coordinate the test under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director Olivier Niggli visited RUSADA’s headquarters in Moscow in July. After his visit, he stated that the organization was “on the right track” towards the restoration of powers.
British organisation sceptical about Finnish love for innovation: health benefits of maternity packs "no evidence"
The British organization suspects the benefits of Finnish-style motherhood packages.
Among other things, the BBC and the Guardian report that the Lullaby Trust, which is fighting covert deaths, prohibits the use of its own brochures in the UK of shared motherhood packages.
The distribution of maternity packs to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, the packaging is also distributed in some areas.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity package would reduce the risk of covert death.
Unexplained death means an unexplainable sudden death of the baby.
The Lullaby Trust is an expert in the safety of a child’s sleep.
We will no longer allow you to pack our official listings into them, as it would allow you to understand that we recommend this product, the organization said.
Finland has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world, with only two deaths per thousand births.
According to Lullaby Trust, good reading in Finland is a consequence of many different reasons, such as the low number of teen weights.
The fact that each family is given a box there may be one factor.
It cannot be said for sure, however, said Francine Bates, CEO of Lullaby Trust.
We are concerned that maternity packages will be marketed as products that reduce infant mortality and covert deaths.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention, and it has been given to all mothers in Finland for free for 80 years.
The package includes a variety of accessories, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products in the pack.
The package itself is a cardboard box in which the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
Lullaby Trust says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a sleeping place.
According to Lullaby Trust, the package may be the best option for a place to sleep if there is no shelf or bunk bed available.
The organization recommends using the pack only for daytime use and to stop using it at the point when the child is able to turn around.
The organization also recommends keeping pets away from the packaging and making sure it does not get wet or dirty.
Vikkel<0xC3><0xA4> konna fled to repeat Japanese zoo
The staff of the Japanese zoo are looking for a sheltered turtle.
J<0xC3><0xA4>ttil<0xC3><0xA4>iskilpikonna has surprised the staff at its speed and has already rushed to repeat within two weeks.
The turtle fled the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, western Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the frog had left the zoo through the main entrance.
It doesn’t die immediately because it eats the grass around the zoo, but we’re very worried,” said Yoshimi Yamane, who works in the zoo.
The 35-year-old widow is female, 55 kilos and about a meter long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the opening hours, the village is allowed to walk freely in the barren area.
The zoo has not received eye-catching sightings from the turtle.
The last flight took place the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive walking along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane said.
It is able to walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These Startups Will Help Your Business Avoid Uber Mistakes
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or even misleading.
Although he assured them that the surveys were anonymous, some of the workers were suspicious of them.
“The surveys were simply not consistent and not objective,” Errett says. As her hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on online shopping. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to resort to outside help.
More and more new types of HR start-ups have come to the markets, helping other companies to figure out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure employee engagement. Companies can conduct surveys and target them to specific teams and groups of people, as well as provide their employees with anonymous notification services and, in some cases, a direct link to the top management.
“You can track your health with apps like Strava and Fitbit, but where does Fitbit come from?” asks Jim Barnett, founder and CEO of the Redwood City-based Glint startup. Glint provides analytics software for companies to engage employees.
Errett has been using Glint's software for three years, and he says he has gained an even deeper insight into the thoughts and knowledge of his employees.
The program allows you to make quick surveys and votes for certain teams. In addition, it can create a map from which you can see at a glance, which departments employees are most dissatisfied and which of the leaders have received the weakest reviews. Based on these, Errett is able to
Companies have understood that they need to follow the workplace culture so that they don’t become the next Uber. The transport company has been around since the former employee wrote on his blog about the culture where employees are harassed and harassed.
For startups like Glinti, such omissions are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation, and compliance are a global industry that, according to the Let’s Talk Payments website, could rise to more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, located in Denver, Colorado, is a startup that helps businesses detect and prevent inappropriate behavior. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber’s reputation experienced a collapse.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He also recently signed a deal with Uber.
Like Glint, Convercent gives businesses the opportunity to make customized surveys, collect answers confidentially in real time, and map out problem areas.
In addition, employees can report inappropriate behaviour anonymously by text message.
And if the manager is in doubt about the inconsistencies, the complaints go directly to the company’s board.
“The general opinion has been ruled out by the authorities,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
He recalls that if a company treats its employees poorly or acts unethically, the consequences can become costly, even if the authorities are not involved. Consumers can start boycotting the company, and it can also lose employees and become challenged in court.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has more than 25,000 employees at 500 locations. The company has been using Convercent for more than a year because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of the operating principles and procedures and can easily get in touch with the head office.
Previously, the practice was that if the employee wanted to report the problem, he first had to find out the phone number or email address that could make the notification at the head office. Then he had to make an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
“It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience,” said Ruby Tuesday’s chief legal officer, James Vitrano, who said it was difficult to track complaints from employees.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state. Now, problems like discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
“I get an even more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the employee’s reality,” says Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from work-related litigation."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement even more seriously after the collapse of audit firm Arthur Andersen as a result of unethical activity in the context of the Enron scandal.
It was only through social media that the companies realized that they could no longer prevent their leaks from being publicized.
“Hope was used as a strategy before technology came under the control of ethics,” Quinlan says.
Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for its use.
This is a business model and opportunity accepted by investors, and both Glint and Convercent have capital investors.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised a total of $47 million in capital.
Glint received <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has raised a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million in funding.
Investments are not a surprise given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to a number of studies, employees expect more from their previous jobs.
In competitive markets such as the dairy sector, good wages and interesting projects are just the beginning.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are giving their time to a truly useful company.
“Employees are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened to and that their work is rewarding,” says Nina McQueen, Head of Employee Rewarding and Welfare at LinkedIn.
Investors get a profit when companies succeed. Companies succeed when employees commit to it.
Third-party analytics tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it’s no wonder they’re interested in investors.
According to job culture experts, knowledge of employee engagement is important.
but it is useless if, on the basis of it, no action is taken.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be seen as a sign of change.
And if the change does not come fast enough or nothing changes, disappointment can reduce employee engagement.
“If you ask for four thousand proposals, you have to be ready to go through four thousand discussions,” said Russell Raath, CEO of Kotter International, which has seen companies rely too much on just gathering information.
“If the company doesn’t take action, the workers start to wonder if they’ve become heard.
Does it matter what they think?
If the company doesn’t care about them, why should they care about the company?”
According to Erretti, Madison Reed currently conducts monthly staff surveys and is able to address the problem on the same day as reported in Glint.
After Errett had collected feedback from employees who were frustrated with the slow pace of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to make changes to the teams and arrange communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees even better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help it improve the long-term sustainability of its staff in an industry that is known for its great diversity of employees.
“If a company doesn’t commit to creating a culture of transparency, it loses employees,” says Vitrano.
“If it loses its employees, it also loses its customers.
Without customers, there are no companies.”
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of hiding his naked girlfriend, reports the news agency TT.
A woman in Gothenburg had come home from the shower when she had noticed a phone hanging from her window at the end of the bar.
According to the woman, the cell phone camera pictured the apartment.
The woman who had been missing had run to the other room to get dressed.
When the woman had arrived to check the situation, the phone had been pulled up first, but was soon knocked out of the window again.
A 20-year-old man suspected of conspiring has admitted to photographing a woman.
However, he claimed that he only photographed the woman’s face.
The video on the mobile phone was removed and the police had not been able to return it as evidence.
In the interrogations, the man has committed an act, but has denied being guilty of a crime.
The man he described had justified himself by saying that he loves his neighbor as "a real madman".
According to TT, the news agency is bringing charges against the man.
Teachers call for more slickness in autumn negotiations
Wage development cannot be lower than, for example, in the export industry, but the difference should be narrowed down, said Olli Luukkainen, Chairman of the OAJ.
The temporary cut in public sector holiday funds highlights the difference, he notes.
We do not have the opportunity to enter into agreements in which there is no way that the holiday cuts would be included in the review.
Agreements in the municipal sector will only be created once the private sector papers have been signed and the percentages of increase are clear.
Lukkainen predicts that, for example, the working conditions of the OAJ have been agreed in January.
Percentage targets Lukkainen has not yet revealed.
Luukkainen is also the chairman of Juko, a public sector-trained negotiating organisation.
Highlights: Holiday cut-off increases earnings growth rates
According to the OAJ, statistics and forecasts show a decline in the purchasing power of public sector wage earners, while at the same time increasing the purchasing power of the private sector.
According to the figure, the temporary holiday cut further sharpens the ranks of earnings development.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many students per teacher can be
In addition, OAJ notes that the equality of basic education must be ensured, as the differences between the best and the weakest are constantly increasing.
According to the organization, the learning outcomes are deteriorating, and the differences between students and regions are constantly increasing.
The day of the Bruins players lasted longer as the NCAA reduced daily exercises from two to one
It’s almost 11:00 p.m., and a group of UCLA football players have left to chat on the other side of the campus for new training courses.
Some of them have stripped off their shirt, their backs glittering with sweat after the first day of training camp.
Time for many of them this few-minute talk session is a midnight break.
After three hours of practice at the university, players will return to their dormitory to read the final exams. The next morning they will meet at the Wasserman Football Center at half-seven.
“The next three days will be tough for these guys,” Bruins coach Jim Mora says just before Monday’s shift to Tuesday.
The University Sports Roofing Association reduced the number of daily practice sessions by two to one. The purpose of the change was to reduce the number of players, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final exams are held.
That’s why UCLA’s first three practice sessions began at over seven o’clock in the evening, and it was difficult to find room for players already full schedules.
Restricting training sessions to one day means that there are more training days in the past. The camp began this year almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time in the six-year training period of Moran, with the same spring period.
The exercises are to be held 18 times before August 20th, when the actual preparation for the opening of the season begins: UCLA will meet in September at Texas A&M University.
Mora says she supported the NCAA’s rule change, even though it made players’ schedules even tighter.
“We’re charging them a lot for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work, they're great friends.
I think the situation will ease when we get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outside after the camp. It is not easy taking into account the direct view from the training camp to the parking area and the Luskin Center, a flat-screen hotel that has already been bombarded with football over-the-air protective nets behind the goalpost.
Bruins players are scheduled to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available outside.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
“The concern is that people can book a room and photograph exercises from there for video. It’s not an exaggerated concern.
The video of the exercises is paid quite a lot.
But we have guards there and in the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to bother my mind too much.
We have a plan.”
Freedom in Rwanda
In Central Africa, presidential elections will be held in Rwanda on Friday, the winner of which will be considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially aiming for his third term, but in practice he has influenced the country's leadership since 1994.
At that time, the RPF rebel group ended the genocide organized by extremists.
He was the commander of the RPF.
Kagamea has been criticized, among other things, for crushing opposition and limiting freedom of speech.
He has also been accused, for example, of distorting poverty statistics.
For the third term, Kagame will be able to try, because the Constitution, which is limited to the two terms of the presidency, was amended.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a truly respected leader.
During his time in Rwanda, social reforms have been made and international investments have flowed into the country.
In addition, Kagame has played a major role in uniting the country that is divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to question whether liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, both have promised their people more freedom after the land has been raised to its feet.
Now might be a good time to start.
Facebook Fights Fake News by Accelerating Fact Checking
Facebook plans to send potential fake news to independent fact-checkers more and more and present the results below the original article. The world’s largest social network announced this on Thursday.
The company published an opinion on its website that it will start using up-to-date machine learning to identify fake news. Possible fake news will be sent to the fact-checkers and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being the biggest broadcasters of fake news. Many believe that fake news affected the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The subject has been raised in a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news before the May presidential election and Germany, which is preparing for the September elections, supports a plan to punish social media networks if they do not remove hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate statement published in Germany that fact-checking is being attempted in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“People want to see which stories don’t go through the footsteps of independent auditors. They also want more background information so they can decide more clearly what they read and share,” Facebook’s product manager, Sara Su, wrote on the company’s blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the Related Articles feature and make other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
The Birth of a Book: The Story of a City
Little Scotney Castle in Kent County is now known for Squeeze's music video and Margaret Thatcher's hideout from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has a stormy history of 700 years. Now, this charming castle in the Bewl River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, an old-fashioned mop-haired writer.
“It’s great for me to be able to explore the text of a person who died more than 300 years ago,” Rhodes said.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold a letter in my hand."
The book, A Castle in England, tells the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era. Each story has been illustrated by a different artist, promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book based on the archives of Rhodes. In 2014 she appeared in Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, whose sources of inspiration were the documents of the British National Library. The project was sensational.
"I moved to tears when I noticed a fingerprint in the letter. The letter had been written by a double agent working for Jacobites in the 1700s," Rhodes says.
"That was his fingerprint!
And the letters smelled of smoke, because the fire was then used as a lighting.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he is on the spot.
I love the archers."
The author of the old documents was allowed to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Council of the Arts of England, which felt too good to be true. He admits that he did not immediately refuse to be in the castle for a little longer than he had hoped.
He spent days exploring Victorian "new" castles, archives, treasures and rarities, such as wall-hanging hyenas and centuries-long bottles in the vault.
He toured the ruins and ruins of the old castle and talked to the forest wardens, gardeners, and sometimes even the artists who painted the book.
In the evening, he “takes the whiskey and begins to write.”
Scotney's close history is quite unknown, as the castle was transferred entirely to the National Trust Foundation only after the death of Elizabeth Hussein in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the foundation’s staff were just starting to go through the archives. Rhodes describes that the archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: by taking all the extras to the attic.
The archives contained diaries, letters from the times of the British Empire and maps of who owned anything. "You could imagine that the earthworms are boring," Rhodes says. "Here, however, families fought even one birch.
I thought I’d let it go already.”
Some of the stories in the book go from the castle to the history of England, such as The Labourer. It tells of a man who shortly after the completion of the castle to the House of Commons of England in 1381.
“The Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a plague in the castle in 1380,” Rhodes says.
"England's peasantry began in the same area, and it came to mind that the rebellion could begin with a mellow one.
Maybe these events are related to each other?”
Other stories in the book are closely related to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, a story about a priest that Darrell’s family hid for seven years during the purification of England.
The Smuggler tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell in the 18th century, who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling the coffin with stones (it was noticed years later when his grave was opened).
Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family in Scotney. "The men in the family seem to have been quite a bunch of wizards. They were constantly in debt and bought things they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family would solve their debt problem by marrying the rich old women, and I see them as good friends who could soften the heirs."
Now Rhodes is looking for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about L<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>nm<0xC3><0xA4>e, a healing farm in the beginning of the 20th century, of which there is still only a wooded plot.
Scotney Castle has a special place in his heart.
“It was sad to leave,” he says.
“I didn’t want to go back to this nightmare.”
Russia's worst war since the Cold War
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think it can be said that NATO’s relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in an interview with CNN.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could seek close cooperation with Russia.
But, especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and Russia’s continuing instability in the eastern Ukraine, NATO’s relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
However, according to Stoltenberg, NATO is still committed to working so that tensions do not escalate to their peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid the escalation of the situation and a new Cold War.
Before Stoltenberg’s comments, U.S. President Donald Trump may have found that the U.S.-Russia relationship was headed even to a dangerously bad level.
Trump urged to thank the country’s poor interests for the Congress, which last week approved new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitshko quits - no rematch against Anthony Joshua
Vladimir Klitshko, the long-time world champion of the professional wrestling heavy series, will end his career.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced his decision on Thursday morning.
Klitshko, who won gold at the 1996 Summer Olympics, played 69 times, winning 64 games.
He held various World Cup titles in 2000–02 and 2006–15.
Klitshko lost his last two games.
Tyson Fury shot him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at Wembley Stadium and lost after a fierce match with a knockout in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitschko were expected to face each other in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko did not find any motivation for the match.
I purposely used a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance to the Wembley game, Klitshko said in his statement.
As an amateur and professional trader, I got everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after the sport.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I'm very grateful for that.
See Klitschko's reasoning for his decision in the video.
Klitschko manager Bernd B<0xC3><0xB6>nte said in a statement that it was difficult for Klitschko to complete the decision.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to quit if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is definitely the right decision, B<0xC3><0xB6>nte said.
Klitshko has been dating American actor Hayden Panettier ever since 2009.
The couple has one child, daughter Kaya, who was born in 2014.
Klitschko’s older brother Vitali is also a former world champion in the heavy-duty series.
In 2008-12, the brothers ruled the World Cup titles of the various leagues at the same time.
The weather forecaster in Finland draws conditions: "Get out of jail"
Seiv<0xC3><0xA4>shypp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> Minna Nikkanen has suffered from conditions during the summer outdoor season.
Where Nikkas has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and the cold are taken from the woman.
There are also unstable conditions at the World Cup in London.
Nikkanen is talking about the weather.
This summer, the conditions have been favorable for Minna Nikka.
I don’t want to blame the track, but it was inconceivable that I didn’t even get the little beaks to move properly,” Nikkanen said after the Innsbruck race.
I have competed and practiced here knew how many times and have never experienced the same varying wind in this place, Nikkanen told Paavo Nurmi Games.
During this period, it has been really difficult to standardize the jump, even when there have been such unstable winds in the exercises, Nikkanen said in Kaleva's kites.
The weather also spoke in London on Thursday.
Time has been challenging to get the technology together - whether it's a cold drink or something.
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken from the file.
It makes no sense to use energy in a bad situation.
He reached his quarterback in 455 thanks to the World Cup.
It's out of 445.
Relationships are not the same for everyone in London.
You have to be patient and wait for better winds.
The goal is to cross the 460 mark on Friday.
Why don’t you go abroad to practice?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was from the beginning in Italy and Germany.
I got a jump in the crowd and a standardized technique.
I should have done the same now.
Normally, the hall has been put to practice, now the hall has been closed.
What would be the perfect race?
25 degrees warm.
There will be a little wind, as long as it's standard.
Ex-Ex-Officer Satisfied Politicians at Yle: "We have no distribution now and not for many years"
Despite the positive economic climate, the government of Juha Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> must keep afloat and warn of the inflating of the state budget by means of debt money, warns the Ministry of Finance of budgets prepared for decades by Erkki Virtanen.
According to him, there is no distribution.
Yle interviewed a retired Virta in the middle week of Ykk<0xC3><0xB6>sauma in 2015.
The construction of the state budget for next year is just beginning.
Recently, we have highlighted some of the policy proposals that have been put forward, including the withdrawal of the guarantee, the lowering of the car tax and the support of electric bicycles, which Virtanen holds as electoral speeches.
They mainly tell us that the elections are beginning to be close, because when ten percent of the state's budget is financed by extra debt, we have no allocation now, not for many years.
I think it's even a scam to talk about sharing when you're in debt, Virtanen said to Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debt is owed to children.
Virtasella has a long experience in preparing state budgets: she started in 1978 at the Ministry of Finance as a budget secretary and then worked as Assistant Director of the Department of Budgets and Head of Budget.
Most recently, before retiring, he served as the Chancellor of the Ministry of Labour and Economic Affairs.
In the interview with Yle, Virtanen noted that the projected growth of three per cent is likely to be temporary.
All forecasters estimate that this is the peak from which we are going to go to the lower secondary level next year, and Finland is expected to grow by one per cent for decades.
Washington changes the rules of permanent residence permit
President Donald Trump said in a statement that the rules for a permanent residence permit, the Green Card, would be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten the requirements for temporary work permits and restrict family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans, and the president supports them.
The bill is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money by changing the way permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces chain migration and replaces the current program.
The new search process will benefit applicants who know English and are able to live up to themselves and who have the skills to benefit our economy,” Trump said in a statement.
The wife of the Danish queen does not want to be buried with the queen in the same place
Prince Henrik does not want to be buried with Queen Margaret.
In the picture, Prince Henry and Queen Margaret depicted in April.
Queen Margaret of Denmark, 77, and her husband Prince Henrik, 83, are not buried next door, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the ruling couples in Denmark are buried in the same place.
The Royal Chamber has announced today that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in Roskilde's Cathedral, the court said in its statement on Thursday.
According to BT magazine, the reason for this is the prince’s dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
It is no secret that the Prince has been dissatisfied with his role and titles in the Danish monarchy, Lene Belleby, head of court communications, commented in the newspaper.
The prince’s decision not to be buried next to the queen is a natural consequence of his not being treated equally with his wife.
According to Hovi, the Queen has long been aware of her husband's desire for a burial place and understands the decision.
Time on the road: The car was coming on the highway
Tommi had an open-minded partner and two young children.
They did not get injured in the accident, but do not receive money from the insurance if the other party is not reached.
The storm occurred at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Archive image of Keh<0xC3><0xA4> III’s construction site.
Vantaa’s Tommi tells her family that she survived a miracle Tuesday in a car accident.
Tommi, his partner Riina and the couple’s two young children were driving on the motorway at Keimolanport in Vantaa towards H<0xC3><0xA4>meenlinna.
After joining Keh<0xC3><0xA4> III on H<0xC3><0xA4>meenlinnanv<0xC3><0xA4>yl<0xC3><0xA4>, a white car was driven along the side of the family car, Tommi says.
Without traffic, the car would have come on, according to Tom.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it went out of hand, Tommi says.
The family's car hit the road at a high speed.
The parents and two small children on the back bench were not injured.
One of the children is a little under 3 years old, the other under 1 year old.
It was obviously a pretty good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one even drove us for a short period of time, even though there was busy traffic.
The accident occurred at about 5:20 p.m.
According to Tommi, no one stopped at them, and the family called the emergency center.
They got out of the car with their own power.
The personnel of the ambulance and rescue agency came to the scene, and the condition of the family was checked.
The car went to the rescue team.
Tommi says he and his partner have small incomes, and they received a generous grant to buy a car a couple of years ago.
According to Tomm, without the information of another car, the family will not get the insurance money.
That is why the family wishes the eye-witnesses for the observations of the car, which caused the family to wander.
We need a car every day.
It’s hard to take kids to the gym and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was a white, old-fashioned car.
It was probably the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 2000s.
He thought the car's registration number was SIG.
If the culprit is not caught, I don't know how to do it financially, we still have to count every penny today.
Tommi hopes that what happened or that they know something about it will be in contact with the police.
The Eastern Uusimaa Police Station and the Central Uusimaa Rescue Station confirm that they have had an accident at the scene on Tuesday evening.
The title and the story corrected at 9:15 p.m.: Unlike the story was originally told, another car, according to Tomm, did not come to chase the opponents, but was to drive from the accelerator to the side of the family car.
Lotta J<0xC3><0xA4>ppinen's presentation deals with human relationships through humor - The Self-Publisher Seen in the What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday
Lotta J<0xC3><0xA4>ppinen, from Kouvola, brings her foreword to the What? theatre.
The self-explanatory is a musical theatre performance about past human relationships and inadequacy.
According to director Lotta J<0xC3><0xA4>ppisen, it is still a good idea.
The subject is dealt with through humor.
You don’t have to be bored with old feelings, he says.
According to J<0xC3><0xA4>ppisen, the rotating summer theatre performance was carried out on a small-scale budget and with a large, young heart.
The name of the show challenges to think about what a person reveals to himself when he meets a new person.
Is he going to play a role or is he going to open another jacket?
Juoneto's presentation mixes fact and fiction
J<0xC3><0xA4>ppinen has both directed and dramatized the show.
He is also responsible for the lights.
The proposal consists of the texts of the working group and has no substance.
The director believes that while the show is about the thoughts of young people, it speaks to all ages.
Jj<0xC3><0xA4>ppinen emphasizes that the Self-Publisher does not directly tell about his own and the human relations of the working group.
Fact and fiction are intertwined.
I'm sure my world of value will be affected by the show.
I don’t think human relationships are bad, but neither do I think that human relationships, especially relationships, are a prerequisite for happiness.
Many learn from divorced parents.
J<0xC3><0xA4>ppinen believes that the Self-Publisher draws a current picture of young adults living in Finland at the age of 100.
According to him, many have learned a lot about human relationships from their parents, many of whom have divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don’t have to stay in a bad relationship.
The show features Minea L<0xC3><0xA5>ng, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The team also includes costume designer Ella Snellman.
The musical arrangement is J<0xC3><0xA4>ppinen and Rokan.
The love of theatre ignited in Kouvola
Lotta J<0xC3><0xA4>ppinen, 26, from Kouvola, studies as a theatre director at the Turku University of Applied Sciences.
Two years behind and two years ahead of me.
J<0xC3><0xA4>ppisen’s enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the Kouvolan years.
The music classes have been brought up as assistants at the Kouvola Theatre and have performed at the University Theatre in Helsinki and lastly at the Linnatheater in Turku.
The management has become more and more interested.
The self-sacrifice got its first night last week in Helsinki on Narri’s stage.
In the future, a performance lasting about 45 minutes will also be seen in at least J<0xC3><0xA4>ppisen’s student centre in Turku.
The self-discovery of Kouvola What? at the theatre 4.8. at 19 and 5.8. at 14 and 19.
Finland's Olympic champion recovered from severe motocross incontinence for a year - broken neck
Few athletes in Finland have the same unstoppable natural force as Janne Lahtela.
In a peer-to-peer relationship, he toured the world for hundreds of days a year for twenty years and pursued his dream of Olympic gold.
The dream came true in 2002, but the Lahtela movement continued.
He was not only a tireless practitioner, but also an experimenter of new species.
There are not many forms of exercise on earth that the chemist would not have tried at least once.
It has inspired me to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtela says.
In the end, one hobby was to stop Lahtela altogether.
In 2014, Lahtela suffered a motocross accident.
As a result, his neckline and both hands broke.
I wasn't at work.
"I've had my injuries at home for a year," Lahtela says.
Lahti had bad luck.
He also admits that his age may have been a part of his life.
Driving on a steep slope can sound like a dare.
I didn't draw any boundaries.
It's just a species so hard that a foursome like this shouldn't be too much fun!
After the accident, Lahtela was in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
Behind him was a long climb as the head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started her career immediately after finishing her career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do anything, Lahtela says.
During her training, Lahtela often challenged her protection in her hips and physical tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so physically and mentally tired that my thoughts didn’t even seem to make sense.
Not even with the species.
It was good to be there.
I really enjoyed it, because I really just got to be.
A mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become the head coach of Finland.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'll be back.
It’s easier to find places that have passed through than the hedgehogs!
Without an accident, I would not have realized that I needed to rest so much.
Lahtila started coaching the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby in place of speedboats.
Switched motocrosses to frisbee golf!
It just got out of the barn right away.
At worst, I spent seven hours a day throwing.
Although Lahtela has always been a superstitious coach himself, he does not require his coaches to be the same as him.
I'm not forcing everyone to the same shape.
In our variety culture there is a place to be your own and a way to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and the mentality has always been consistent with it, Lahtela says.
Sex robots are coming, and we should be worried.
It’s here: a report on the development of technology in the sex robot industry – just when it started to feel like 2017 can’t be any more strange.
Yes, it is.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots within the next 5 to 10 years.
“We need to start taking a serious approach to the generalization of sex robots,” says Noel Sharkey, founder and emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield.
Customers can choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
“Sex robots are being hanged, but they’re already being sold quite a lot, and we’ll see more of them,” Sharkey said in a statement.
Sex dolls have evolved from breathable dolls to robots with a warm, silicone-like skin and artificial intelligence-created features that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot to their own preferences, always from the color of the eyes to the shape of the nails and the type and color of the fingernails.
What’s even more worrying is that robots have a “personality” that makes Stepford’s women look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sex dolls have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of the RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, even for swimming.
True Companion’s Roxxxy Gold robots have a pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems creepy, Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality adapts as perfectly as possible to the user’s personality,” the company’s website reads.
In other words, the robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different moods:
It can be tired, talkative, or “in the wind.”
There are many worrying features in the proliferation of sex robots. They replace genuine human relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and direct rape fantasies, as the user approaches, for example, a robot programmed to swim and resist.
True Companion compares the Roxxxy robot to the vibrator on its website:
"Women have a vibrator. Why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a new kind of sex play.
Their generalization and development tells of something darker and deeper in our culture: the decline in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subordination is one option among others.
The majority of men, of course, did not get a sex robot, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report reported their growing popularity.
Marginal phenomena, however, tell a lot about the spirit of time.
And many begin to behave strangely or offensively only after the market gives it permission.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to spread at the same time as women’s rights are threatened around the world and the White House is sitting with a president who has encouraged women to be harassed.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale (Orjataresi) is not the most disturbing of its powerful imagery, such as images of suspended bodies and out of mined eyes. The most disturbing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now there seems to be a surprisingly short journey.
Sex robots are trying to do as much as possible for real women (with porn star ratios) as is technically possible.
The developers of the robots want their skin to feel real and the movements to mimic as well as possible human movements.
However, their “personalities” are far from reality.
The robot is unable to leave the relationship or the situation.
They don’t have their own will or history – nothing that points to independence or violates the fantasy of complete submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Slavery.
Police suspect two terror attacks were planned in Australia, the group was led by the head of Isis
The head of the organization, Isis, led a group of Australians who are suspected of planning to take the bomb to Etihad Airways.
According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the person in charge of ISIS had also sent building components of the bomb to Sydney.
It was suspected that the bomb was intended to be taken to the plane on July 15, but the company stopped before security checks.
The police did not give any details as to why the operation was stopped.
The second plan of the suspected terrorists was to build a device that emits toxic colorless gas and take the device to a crowded public place, such as a public transport.
Australian Assistant Commissioner Michael Phelan says the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were arrested in police raids on Saturday due to suspected terrorist plans.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations will also be continued.
The good side of Trump?
Make Mitt Romney look like he's got a sense of common sense.
During the Trump era, it has already been repeated to the point of exhaustion that the strong bipartisanship of voters has also broken up families at the daily level.
On the way to Christmas and Thanksgiving, the U.S. newspapers’ advisory panels were guided by how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We all want our information to be leaked.
Less attention has been paid to Trump’s ability to connect families.
I'm going to tell you about this because my cousin was living in New York this week, and he's a left-leaning poet living in Chicago, who's long had a crush on our Republican family.
He pointed out that a common enemy can have a powerful ally effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, my cousin everyone knows – even the Republican-backed sibling with whom he has been arguing about politics for decades – are suddenly and surprisingly on the same side.
It is a good thing on the day table, but more broadly, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new power, but the distorting influence of his presidency can actually take us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we’re talking about the frightening possibility that one day we won’t be able to intimidate him anymore.
In the long run, there is an even more shocking possibility that Trump is normalizing the right kind of Republicans, who suddenly seem reasonable compared to Trump.
I remember Mitt Romney’s controlled version of insanity: a dog on the roof of a car, a 14 percent income tax (and his tax return we’ve seen at least). Compared to Trump, they seem to be very mild violations.
When the Trump season is over, the next Republican presidential candidate just needs to be clear, and it feels like a significant improvement right away.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our child to the Central Park Carousel, which is the largest carousel in New York's Park Department, and the best thing about New York City for $3 without caffeine.
Karuselli’s horses are huge, the characters in the middle – the fierce clowns and the animals who look back at the horror – are evil, and the swirling music behind them is a strangely fascinating one.
Many of New York’s iconic circuits fade into disappointment over time: the views of tall buildings start to get boring, the city’s silhouette becomes too familiar, and the city’s reality does not match dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I haven’t completely gotten over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage, but a large traffic circle in Northern London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is indeed a Swiss-personal pub, but it doesn’t count.
The carousel of the Central Park, on the other hand, still has a strange magical experience – even to the extent that two two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-old and two fourteen-year-old women enjoyed it immensely.
I would have given the carousel full points if someone had asked me for my review, but fortunately no one came to ask.
Instead, I was asked this week at the warehouse to rate my "payment experience" on a scale of one to five stars before I put my credit card on the readout device.
The same thing in the cafe at my home corner, but there I will also be given the opportunity to combine the 15 percent service money into the estimate when I go to the coffee shop myself.
This slows down the interaction in the archive and pushes the client server to put its person into the game in a situation where it is not needed.
The seller of the warehouse smiled in a state of regret when I tiredly gave my credit card five stars for the experience.
Shefki Kuqi fired from Inter - "There was no leadership trust"
FC Inter has today relieved Shefki Kuq from the duties of coach of the representative team.
Former assistant coach Fabrizio Piccare was responsible for the training.
The other training group will continue in its current duties.
Piccareta has previously worked as an assistant coach in Sunderland, England.
In January, 51-year-old Piccare, a member of Inter’s training team, was granted a UEFA Pro license last year.
FC Inter chairman Stefan H<0xC3><0xA5>kans regrets what happened.
Replacing a coach is never an easy or enjoyable task.
Shefki Kuq, however, no longer had the trust of the management of the company, when there was no other option now, H<0xC3><0xA5>kans commented in the company's statement.
The Piccareta agreement will remain in force until the end of the season.
Together with the other training group, he is already in charge of tomorrow's home game against the HIFK.
According to evening reports, the team has been on a roll through Thursday.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the assistant coaches Piccare and John Allen have been moved out.
Kuqi and Piccareta took a strong lead in Inter’s match against PS Kemi last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youth picture from the 80s - would you recognize a serious violin student?
Linda Lampenius, a violinist, posted a youth picture on Instagram.
Several horseshoes have been added to the picture, on the basis of which one can conclude that the music is in the picture of a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders about a young woman looking at a serious camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he was communicating.
If the image does not appear, you can view it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and has also spoken about painful topics.
A year ago, she posted a picture of herself on Instagram.
In the second picture he is seen 20 years ago, in the second he poses now, as the mother of two children.
In his caption, Lampenius thinks of his own growth as a human being and refers to eating disorders that he suffered from when he was younger.
Just 20 years ago and today...
I still look a lot the same as that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is that I have learned to like myself and how I look.
Behind the text he had added in English hashtags life, eating disorder, uncertainty, self-confidence, self-esteem, love yourself, 1996, 2016, aging, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating disorders of previous years.
He was already in the hospital at the age of 14 for anorexia and orthorexia.
A little later, he also became ill with bulimia, which was not revealed until 2006.
The healing began with a small stroke.
In addition to therapy and comparison, Lampenius helped a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius was taken from prison to a hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment for cold sores on his wrists, which, according to the prison authorities, he received after falling into a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of the murder of the defendants from the original murder conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of his friend's day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the toilet door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder who was hiding in the toilet.
Prosecutors have said they intend to appeal again, as they consider Pistorius’ six-year sentence too light.
The Attorney General intends to appeal to South Africa’s highest court, and the complaint is likely to be dealt with this year.
If the complaint is accepted, Pistorius's sentence may be extended to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in place in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping in Greece
Two illegally camped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, the country’s foreign ministry said on the bTV channel.
The police detained a group of people who were allowed to camp in Sithon on the morning of 1 August. Among the campers were two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation into the case continues.
According to bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that it would later release Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping areas and are already imposing significant fines on all those who camp in areas other than those reserved for purpose.
Inspections will continue until the end of the season.
The Ministry announced that the court may order a fine.

Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may help relieve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for the digestive system.
However, a recent study claims the opposite: a diet rich in protein and dairy products may facilitate the formation of irritable bowel syndrome.
The syndrome of irritable bowel is an incurable disease, which affects about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 people in the United Kingdom. It causes stomach cramps, bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers at the University of Washington found that the necessary amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body to develop immune cells that strengthen the lining of the gut.
According to Marco Colonna, head of the study, immune cells protect the gut and ensure that harmful microbes do not enter the body.
Inflammation-causing cells balance the cells, which strengthen the tolerance. They protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance drops too close to the inflammation, the result may be a syndrome of the irritated intestine.
In experiments, it was found that the immune cells that strengthen the susceptibility are in mice with a certain bacterium in their gut.
This bacterium needs tryptophan to make immune cells appear. Tryptophan is one of the building blocks of proteins.
“We discovered a link between the development of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and cells that promote susceptibility. Lactobacillus reuteri is part of the intestinal normal microbiome,” says Professor Colonna.
“The more tryptophan was in the mice’s diet, the more they had such immune cells.”
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan can strengthen intestinal tolerance and reduce the risk of inflammation.
In the study of immune cells that strengthen susceptibility, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one mouse group had such cells, they did not have the same mouse species that were considered separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the microbes in the gut of mice, or the normal community of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the digestive tract.
When the gut DNA of mice was studied, six bacterial species were detected in mice that had immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria were administered to mice that had no gut microbiome and did not develop immune cells in a sterile environment, immune cells began to appear.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system. They raised Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in the liquid and transferred small amounts of fluid – without bacteria – into immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells evolved into cells that strengthen the immunity.
When the active substance was purified from liquid, it was shown to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of cells that strengthen the susceptibility increased by about 50 percent. When the amount of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous one.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, humans have the same ability-building cells as mice, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether the by-products of tryptophan from the bacteria Lactobacillus reuteri cause cells to develop in humans in the same way as in mice. However, genetic errors related to tryptophan have been detected in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
“We certainly want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation in the intestines,” says Cervantes-Barragan.
"High tryptophan levels combined with Lactobacillus reuteri bacteria may contribute to their generalization."
Jose Mourinho says Manchester United have reached a deal with Nemanja Matic
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United got a "nero" after a deal with Nemanja Matic. The midfielder made his debut in the Manchester United line-up against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Matic, who moved <0xC2><0xA3>40 million from Chelsea, started with a 2–1 win in Dublin, United's last match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and made an impact as a defensive midfielder against stars like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic wasn’t in the best condition yet, as he wasn’t on the Asian tour of blue shirts before the start of the season. He only managed 45 minutes on the pitch – that’s what Mourinho said before the start of the season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, and his way of thinking make him a genius – he has the natural thinking ability of football,” Mourinho says.
"We'll help him be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku were also starting the game at Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho began to dilute his starting line-up for the start of the season.
This week, the Independent revealed that Mourinho wants three more players, even though the club has already done an "excellent job" by getting three of his four priorities from the player.
“Three out of four – it has to be given thanks to the company,” he added.
"I'm more satisfied if I get all four, but they did an excellent job."
Balloons have been harassing Germany for two seasons.
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost their fourth World Cup tie to Germany in a straight 0-3 draw (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The level of German routine playing is high.
Their game was smooth in every sector, Finnish head coach Tapio Kangasniemi said in a statement.
In the first two, Finland kept their opponents tight, but in the third, Germany was clearly stronger.
Germany leads the bloc.
When we played patiently and in certain places aggressively enough, we were able to sleep with it,” Kangasniemi said.
Finland’s most effective score was 14 points collected by Piia Korhonen.
Three out of four matches lost to Finland on Sunday in Slovenia.
Reuters: Big jury has already sent challenges to Trump Jr.'s Russia meeting
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s large jury has already sent challenges to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and the Kremlin’s well-known Russian spokesman Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The news agency Reuters, which at the same time confirms to the Wall Street Journal earlier on Thursday the call for a meeting of a large jury.
According to Reuters, a large jury has sent challenges related to the meeting of Trump Jr. and Kremlin-linked Veselnitskaya, which was held during the U.S. presidential election in June 2016.
There was also Donald Trump Sr.’s then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his wife, current White House adviser Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has called for a large jury in Washington means a tightening of the pace of the Russian investigation.
The sources add that Mueller wanted the help of a large jury to investigate Russia’s involvement in the U.S. presidential election and whether Trump’s campaign or his immediate surroundings cooperated with Russia in the matter.
The grand jury expands Mueller’s rights to collect evidence, sends challenges, and forces people to testify on a whim.
A large group of Valamis is a group of ordinary citizens who work behind closed doors.
The grand jury weighs the evidence in the prosecutor’s investigation and decides whether the charges should be raised in the case.
British inventor microscrews himself to get to his home and car with a handshake
The British inventor is the first to microcirculate himself across the country so that he can open the door to his home, get into his office, and start his car with a handshake.
The microsurgeon is 33 years old between Steven Northam’s thumb and forearm. He now offers services to businesses and individuals who want to make their lives easier with Northam’s BioTeq technology.
Northam collaborates with Geoff Watson, a consul in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, in order to meet the medical requirements of the microchip.
The microchip uses the same technique as the microchips of cats and dogs, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company also makes the locks of houses and cars compatible with the microchip. One lock processing costs <0xC2><0xA3>300.
Northam is married and has one child. He has installed microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
The White House Show Pays Thousands of Dollars to Taxpayers
The White House’s latest decision to fly a naval helicopter to the White House’s southern lawn at an event presenting American production had to pay taxpayers $24,000, according to the documents obtained by TIME magazine from the military.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the president is on its knees. It was a draw in the White House at an event held on July 17, 2017, where American building programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a team of White House officials were introduced to products from all 50 states.
In addition to a helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, the samples included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a truck from Mississippi.
The White House Military Bureau had requested the helicopter to be placed on the spot by a specific order only about 36 hours before it landed on the southern desert plain for an "exceptional" event. This is evident from the documents of the Navy's HMX-1 helicopter ship.
“I just wanted to make sure you’re aware of this because it’s an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility,” HMX-1 unit commander wrote the day before the event in an email to his commander, who is an assistant commander of the Navy Air Force.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern grassland at 7 p.m. on July 17 and the event would begin at 3 p.m. The helicopter would leave the site only after the grassland was emptied in the evening between 6 and 9 p.m.
In addition, the message stated that if the departure of the helicopter from the White House was delayed, another crew would be needed on the spot due to service time constraints.
The original crew was in the helicopter at the time of the incident, and the unit's security personnel were with the helicopter when it was in the country.
It is not clear from the documents received by the TIME magazine whether another crew was eventually needed.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 investigated the violation of the law.
“One of our questions was whether this Hatch Act was violated, and we were told it wasn’t violated,” the commander wrote.
“It sounds like you can participate,” the assistant commissioner replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But the official events also have political tones.
At the meeting, the president spoke in favour of the health reform that was at the time under consideration by the Senate and more liberal state regulation.
The use of the Marine One helicopter and Air Force One aircraft for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents have to use them on their travels.
But their use only for photos is unusual.
Trump’s actions drew attention in February when Air Force One rolled against the backdrop of the presidential campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and Trump has strongly criticized his predecessor’s use of the presidential plane on Twitter.
“The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which showcased products made from American workers’ materials from all 50 states,” White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews regularly make training flights in Washington, D.C., and practice in the southern desert bringing the president to the White House with an accuracy of one centimeter.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises at the White House.
According to one official, flights to the Made in America event were part of the crew's monthly training quota.
On that day, the unit’s helicopters also flew for 11 hours in “non-presidential support missions”.
According to the White House, there were no other costs for taxpayers.
Sikorsky’s spokesman said the company was not involved in organizing a helicopter demonstration in the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have an accounting for flights related to the duties of the President, and accurate assessment of the cost of the event is difficult.
According to the Ministry of Defense’s 2017 hourly compensation, the compensation level for the VH-3D helicopter is $24,380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from Quantico base in Virginia to the White House and back lasted a total of one hour.
According to the White House, the cost of using the helicopter is significantly lower.
“The calculation of the costs to taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading,” Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called so-called embedded costs, which are taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the event.
“The idea is to introduce American production,” Spicer said.
“I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud to be involved in ensuring national security and are likely to employ hundreds or thousands of people through it.
And I think that, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defense equipment that many Americans have worked hard on.
It’s completely factual to point out.”
Not sure if Trump was in a helicopter during the incident, but at least he sat in the driver’s seat.
In the White House, Trump joked about his own Sikorsky ship.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Salama hit Vaasan-Rada - trains have to be replaced by buses
The passenger traffic between the Sein<0xC3><0xA4>joki and Vaasa is bypassed due to a technical error, says Rataliikennekeskus.
Trains are currently being replaced by buses.
An error in the traffic control system caused the hatch.
In the morning, there was no assessment of the duration of the repair.
Venezuela's prosecutor demands the right to prevent the appointment of the country's new representative
The Venezuelan prosecutor has appealed the court’s decision to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that the delegation elected in the last Sunday vote is scheduled to be appointed on Friday.
In the contested vote, the country was elected a representative body, which may, among other things, amend the country's constitution.
According to the Attorney General Luisa Ortega, the decision to prevent the election has been called for.
Ortega has also started an electoral survey since the vote.
He appointed two judges after the British company, which organised a representative vote, said the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities was approximately one million higher than the actual number of voters.
Only Maduro's allies were eligible for representation, with Maduro's son and wife included in the 545-member list.
In addition to changing the Constitution, the House of Representatives can dissolve the opposition-led Congress and change the laws.
Maduro is described as a dictator.
Maduro's actions have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the constitutional amendment as a way for Maduro to strengthen his position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called him a dictator.
The European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they will not recognise a new representative body.
Maduro claims that the new representative body is the solution to the country’s political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, unrest has continued for months.
Many people have been injured and more than a hundred have died.
Venezuela has called for the price of oil to fall.
Now many people do not have access to food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to show its opinion on Friday, when the new representative body is due to start.
Russian Man Sentenced to 4 Years in Prison in the U.S.
On Thursday, the Minneapolis U.S. Supreme Court sentenced 41-year-old Maxim Senah to nearly four years in prison for participating in a global computer fraud.
Senah was arrested in Finland in August 2015 as a result of a claim made by the United States.
According to Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was returning home.
Finland handed over Senah to the U.S. judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian objections, the news agency AFP reports.
He was found guilty of a computer fraud in March of this year, which had benefited millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah is expelled from the country after serving a prison sentence.
Russia’s foreign ministry denounced Finland harshly after the arrest and said the man should not be extradited to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were alleged to have been arrested in Finland without Russia being aware of the matter in advance.
According to the prosecutor, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury, which was caught on tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus was used to fish for usernames and passwords.
The fraudsters then used the data to continue to control Internet traffic, which made click frauds and spread spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, the head of the Department of Justice’s criminal justice department, the case shows that the United States is also capable of hunting other active cybercriminals.
“We have the ability and desire to identify, find and bring them to justice,” Blanco said in a statement.
Modified at 20:58: Corrected spelling of the name of the convicted person.
The third season of Narcos: Pablo Escobar is off the charts, so the Cali cartel will take the lead in Netflix’s hit series
Although Pablo Escobar’s killer was revealed in Narcos’ second season of production, Netflix’s series is certainly not over.
The live streaming service has already confirmed that the series will see the third and fourth seasons of production. The trailer of the third season has been released, and it introduces the new installments of the series.
During the third production season, the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world’s richest drug trade organization.
The four-legged organization operates “like a Fortune 500 company,” except that the government’s bribery and violence is a bit more.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Amman) maintains connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In the recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>ana, who paints American and Colombian police officers for the war on drugs.
New faces include Matthias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos begins on September 1.
Kari Kola performs an exceptional light art work in Paris
The Joensuu light artist Kari Kola (in spring) will carry out an exceptional light art work in honour of the first Day of Light set by the UN in Paris next May 16.
Kola makes a work of light in Paris called Day and Night.
The themes of the work are light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The building of the UNESCO headquarters Fontenoy and the Globe monument in front of it are illuminated.
I want to emphasize not only the light, but also the darkness.
Today, light pollution in millions of cities is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can raise the important things I have experienced to be concretely visible, says the light artist Kari Kola from his work.
I am well-received by the invitation to participate in the first International Day of Light and to bring light art into the theme day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was involved in the opening of the Light theme year in 2015, when she lit the festival in honor of Unesco’s main house.
I feel very privileged to have my art re-enacted in Unesco’s headquarters, Kari Kola says.
The work may be expanded to a very large extent.
We will inform you about this later in the coming autumn, Kola continues.
The aim of the International Day of Light is to highlight the importance of light for humanity and to increase people’s awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The first Day of Light will be celebrated at Unesco’s headquarters in central Paris on May 16.
Two men fight in the mall’s parking lot in Espoo
There was a dispute between two men at the Iso Omena parking lot in Espoo on Wednesday morning.
According to the parties, the dispute began when the other party accidentally drove in its prohibited direction.
There was a verbal dispute between the drivers.
The driver driving in the prohibited driving direction would disturb the driver of another car, as a result of which this car went into motion by hitting the hitter's car.
After that, he hit a car that still crashed into the cockpit.
The man has admitted in his preliminary speech that he caused the damage and did it wrong.
Timo Soin with the question mark: "After that came the water splash"
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (av.) published a blog post on Thursday, which is titled with a question mark.
The writing is short, only two sentences in size.
In my time, the party grew from zero to the government party of thirty-seven MPs.
After that came a water splash, now everything is swirling, Soini writes.
The text of the Soin contains references to 18th-century France.
King Louis XV or his mistress Madame de Pompadour is known to have used the water softening equation.
Depending on the interpretation, the history books have been left with the phrases "the watershed of our traces" or "the watershed of mine after me".
According to the UN, Afghanistan's democracy depends on women's political role
The elections are representative only if all members of society, including women, can vote in them, said the head of the UN’s Afghanistan mission on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, interim head of the U.N. Relief Mission, said hundreds of women are eligible for the provincial council elections, three women are seeking to become vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized," Haysom said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved in them and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghanistan's regional council and presidential elections will be held on 5 April 2017.
The Taliban has presented electoral threats at the same time as international forces are transitioning to an advisory role.
This year’s elections are the first time that power has been peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that women’s contribution strengthens Afghanistan’s democracy.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Board, of the 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
Friday is Rainy and Windy
Friday brings a lot of rain to the south.
In the capital, the weather is rainy and quite windy.
In the afternoon, the cloud cover swells and can develop cracks.
In the evening, it is clearer and more palatable.
The sediment brings abundant rainfall to the southern and central parts of the country, which can also occur in the south.
In the evening in the south there is a lunch seat and clearer, someone's raincoat can still come.
The afternoon temperature is in the rain at about fifteen degrees, on the south coast more uniformly closed to rain close to twenty degrees.
In the north, the cloudiness varies and comes from local afternoon spots.
During Friday and Saturday, low pressure dominates the weather conditions in the southern and central parts of the country, and rainfall is common.
In the north, there is little rain.
On Saturday, the southern and central parts of the country rain in many places, including the owl.
The rain also covers part of the price.
In the north, the cloudiness is abundant in the afternoon and there will be individual rain showers.
On the southern coast it winds from the south, in the central and northern part of the country the air flow is east.
On the north side of the British Isles, there is a strong low pressure, which is associated with heavy rainfall in the southern part of Fennoscandia.
In Western and Central Europe, the West Bank is dominated by airflow and there will be some curiosities.
In southern Europe, the weather is sunny and hot, and the temperature rises to places above 40 degrees.
In the eastern part of the Mediterranean there are shells.
The influx of certain tourists threatens the culture of the region
Authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
The anger of locals is particularly directed towards the form of cruises to represent tourism.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: the place is only a few hours away and is crowded with large crowds of visitors.
Venice is full of fast day trips to the city for tourists.
The streets on the streets are hard to move around and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the Venetians are no longer able to accommodate.
They are forced to move further and further away from the historic center while the hotels have become the replacement for the homes.
The problems brought by tourism in Venice are written by The New York Times and The Guardian.
Authorities are considering restrictions on tourist rates.
They call the current phenomenon "low-quality tourism" - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, time is given two or three hours.
You will follow the ticket-keeping guide from Piazzale Roma to Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Square, and turn back, describes the prevailing and problematic tourism of Italian Minister of Culture Dario Franceschini.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We need to preserve this part of the identity of the cities.
St. Mark’s Square is also one of the most popular tourist attractions in Venice’s historic centre.
The church of St. Mark is located on the side of the tower.
The anger of the locals is also mainly directed towards cruises.
In the historical center of Venice, there are more than 50,000 locals.
In 1951, there were about 175,000 inhabitants.
In July, an estimated 2,000 Venezuelans expressed their opinion against mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives the inhabitants away.
About 2,000 people leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years there will be no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological, and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, the author of the report.
The equation is difficult, as the ships bring to Venice the revenue it desperately needs and create the need for numerous jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it is planned that the cruisers will go further from the historical center.
According to Luciano Bortot, who lives in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the administrative region of Venice, where Venice is also located, had more power to decide its own affairs - if not full autonomy.
In Venice, about 20-30 million tourists visit each year.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
On the motorway, bad traffic jams of kilometers
On the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi, on the northern slope, there have been loads of miles of work on Thursday afternoon during the return journey.
In the area, the surface work of motorways is being done, which slows down traffic, says Savo Messages.
For data, there is a 50-kilometer clock speed limit instead of a normal 120-kilometer clock speed.
However, in the 50 km restricted area, traffic had progressed on Thursday afternoon in places with practically no walking speed.
The road works continued on Thursday afternoon on the side of the Siilinj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi Lake, near the Enlightenment Dam, i.e. the Golden Gate Gate.
I’m doing well without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has been forced to notice the public's pain.
Amalie Iuel has published great pictures of herself in the Grand Canyon landscapes.
Danish-Norwegian Amalie Iuel has risen to become a popular athlete in Norway, not least because she broke the record in March 26 in the 400-metre run of the old Norwegian record by lapsing 51.81 at the time of the cycling race.
A month later, he improved the 400-meter hurdles at the time of the Norwegian record 55.38.
Soon after his recordings, Iuel, who used social media in earnest, noticed that fame and publicity had their shadow sides.
Men all over the world began to send pictures of their genitals to Iuel apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuelin was forced to close his Snapchat account from outside.
I got a lot of "breakthroughs" from unknown people, so I had to turn my account private, Iuel told VG magazine.
Iuel didn’t want VG’s interview to identify exactly what kind of pictures he got.
You must think, Iuel laughed.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I'll be fine without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, his father is Danish-Norwegian.
Iuel’s family moved to Norway when he was 2 years old.
When Amalia was 12, her family moved to Namibia first because of her father’s work, then to Pakistan.
After that, they were in Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel spent four years at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he switched Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is coached by Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
In Norway, it is much more open to debate than in the United States.
In the United States, coaches don’t ask for anything, they just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to deal with the athlete personally, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the Norwegian records in the 400-meter and 400-meter hurdles.
Snowboarder Janne Korve took to the podium of her entire career - now in the World Cup: "It's nice when you don't get anywhere"
It's been nice to count now that nothing's happened!
Janne Korpi, 31, one of Finland’s most successful snowboarders, has once again been able to really enjoy his beloved species this season.
Last summer, his career was on the line.
The stress of the footboard had forced Korve to the cutting table in January, and the foot did not want to heal at all.
He also had a hand in the corner.
In the summer I didn’t know what to do, whether the boat continues or not.
The sponsorships were broken and many things were open, Korpi says.
But it is said that things have a way of organizing.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began to draw back to the waist.
The follow-up was easy after that.
I finally knew it when I was walking in the snow.
I was that damn, yes this is so fun again, we're going through a couple more.
The Corps was only able to calculate correctly in September-October, but after a long invoicing break, only painless training has been a big deal.
There are only a few who have toured the Corps.
It doesn't matter.
Competition has never been the most important aspect of the boat for Korve.
I've never counted on one cat.
I think it's frustrating to aim for four years alone at the polls, and then you're in the heat of that week.
I can't think like that, Korpi says.
Today Korpi is competing in the semi-finals of the World Cup in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Even though individual races do not keep him on board, in the tough competition he always gets on fire.
According to the basket, the rating of the skis organized by the International Ski Federation has increased in recent years, although some of the boarders chose the Norwegian X-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important races, the visibility is great.
In my opinion, however, appreciation always depends on what conditions and what level there are in cats.
Korpi is the oldest athlete on the Finnish 12-man team in Sierra Nevada.
The team's coaches, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekangas and Emmi Parkkisenniemi, are 14 years younger than Korpea.
It's nice to watch the younger guys go.
I remember when I was myself at the time, everything was new and was so sickly excited about everything.
It also brings a new flow to itself, Korpi thinks.
I'm still on my knees, but otherwise I don't, so there's a lot of energy in my friends!
In the background of her writing career, Janne Korpi has also built a different kind of sports career.
The son of director Pekka Korve is addicted to sports: the boarder has his own gymnastics for which he makes training programs.
When I am on a journey all the time, it is no longer necessary to be at the fair.
But every day I look at at at least the nutritional results and usually at some sort of starting point, Korpi says.
According to Korve, medical guidance and training is a potential career plan when the shipping career comes to an end in time.
I don’t plan that far, but it’s at least a likely option.
I feel like I'm learning a little bit about it on this snowboard.
I try to keep up with the nerves and develop, in the summer I may be driving something out of the way.
If it’s my future profession, then it’s not hard to start when you’re already done inside the species.
The events also include the Elitloppet treatment tour, which will be organised with the driver Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The couple has rented a cruise ship, which will be heading to the Stockholm Elitloppet race at the end of May.
The Korpi and Linnonmaa decided to revive the old tradition.
The cruise has gone very well and people have been excited.
We are already at the point where at least there will be no bankruptcy.
There is still time for a few months, let's hope that the ship will be filled, Korpi says with enthusiasm.
Caregiver project to Kite has surprised everyone
Attendo Esteri is the name of the new care home for 41-year-olds built for Kiteele.
The 1,700-square-foot building will be completed next summer on the other side of the Health Centre.
A common subject of wonder is what is enough for the new treatment unit for the customers, because now during the Civil War many private nursing homes are covered by the customer pool.
Anne Flink Attendolta, Regional Director of Nursing Services, commented that Kite will have more demand in the future, not only for options but also for enhanced service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, the freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Attendo bought private nursing homes in Kiteela, Kanervikkola and Eerikan.
The deal was about business, but the real estate is, of course, a five-year lease.
Flink says that Attendo does not have an urgent need to move operations away from these premises.
More on the subject later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of McVitie's brand at the Scottish plant
The trade union is seeking confirmation from the McVitie's manufacturer's executives of a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
According to GMB’s Scotland Department of the UK General Trade Union, the company has not disclosed its plans for the future of the Tollcross plant.
The factory that manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea and other products has more than 500 employees.
Pladis, which owns the McVitie’s brand, has reported that it has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the plant in recent years.
The company added that employees and representatives of the trade union "will certainly be ranked first" if there are any changes to the activity.
In a letter to the plant manager, GMB urged the company to "response to the fact that no funding has been allocated for the modernization of production lines".
Drew Duffy, a GMB affiliate, is very concerned that the plant manager will not be able to find out about Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plans.
"Families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has focused strongly on the local community and Glasgow's metropolitan area. The factory is a significant employee in the area of high unemployment and poor maintenance.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and livelihoods, as well as Brexit, rising living costs, and continued contraction in production, East Glasgow is in dire need of successful McVitie's production."
According to Pladis, the factory manager had received a letter from the trade union only the day before and the company responds to the letter directly because it appreciates the continued interaction with employees and representatives of the trade union.
“We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, when we openly discussed a number of issues.
We discussed with employees, among other things, that like other highly competitive and insecure companies in the market, we are constantly evaluating all of our businesses and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness."
In recent years, the company has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross plant, in particular in its production lines and in improving operations.
“We are aware of Tollcross’s long history as a manufacturing facility and will surely be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we are going to make changes to the factory’s operations.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s move three years ago?
LaLiga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up on Neymar's goal after paying <0xC2><0xA3>189 million for the conclusion of the transfer agreement, but did PSG warn Barcelona of a record transfer three years ago?
The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record of transfer amounts. The previous record was less than half the size: it was created when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United with a transfer amount of <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
After the move, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive footballer and also the world’s best-paid professional athlete, as PSG offers him more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 in weekly salary after taxes.
Barcelona is known to be angry about PSG’s activities and the way Neymar has left the club. A source close to Barcelona says that the club has been taking very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the PSG president warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that they were interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned PSG’s best-in-class players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they catch our players, we’ll be their opponent and we’ll get in touch with their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all teams.
But if they catch our players, they will have to face the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to be guilty of this: it expressed its interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italians to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will lose its star player Neymar because of this.

Trump's phone calls were invented - White House whistleblower: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House admits that two calls from U.S. President Donald Trump never occurred, according to the New York Times.
Trump’s smoking talks with both the president of Mexico and the leader of the party organization have proved to be invented.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that no calls had been made.
But he said Trump wasn’t lying.
Sanders said many of the party leaders spoke to Trump in person, and Trump had discussed with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the Hamburg G20 summit.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty hard accusation.
Those conversations took place, not just on the phone, but on the faces, Sanders argued.
The speech to the parties raised the blame.
Trump said on Monday that the Mexican president had called him and that Trump had succeeded in pledging illegal immigration.
According to Trump, Pena Nieto said that few will ever cross the southern border of Mexico again, because they know the journey to the U.S. border, which in any case is suffocating.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government released a statement saying that no such call had taken place.
On Tuesday, Politico released a full version of Trump’s interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In it, Trump echoed his speech at a major meeting of the National Party Organization in West Virginia.
I got a call from the leader of the party boys, he said it was the finest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump said.
On Wednesday, the party organization said it was not aware of anyone’s call to Trump.
The statement, in which Michael Surbaugh, the head of the organization, had apologized for Trump’s speech from the party, said he was speaking for himself.
Trump’s speech at the party organization’s meeting sparked much disillusionment, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he ignited the results of last autumn's presidential elections.
