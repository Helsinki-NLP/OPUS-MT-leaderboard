There's a nail in my finger.
Animals are afraid of fire.
It wasn't like seven.
Don't go to college just because that's what's expected of you.
The box is almost empty.
This is gonna happen.
It would have been better if we hadn't done that.
I gave Tom a key to my office.
I need an interpreter.
You understand women's language.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
Attention, please.
I'm ready to help you anytime.
We'll solve it.
The batteries are down.
He found a good seat for me.
Sooner or later, we all die.
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?
Have you packed yet?
Tom applied for the job.
Tomi couldn't help but be disappointed.
We tried to warn you.
I found that their volapus is very complicated, unlike the esperant, which is very simple.
You'd better watch out.
Tom likes kids.
It's been washed today.
That's so wrong.
Tom touched my hand.
Who brought this?
It's full of floor glass.
These bananas are not ripe.
Let's build it behind the curtain.
But I don't have an iron.
I think you were right.
Where was the wedding held?
I swim in the river.
This was not the first time they had done this.
The water is cold.
It was a beautiful summer day.
Sometimes I feel like a fool.
It's a good hiding place.
Do you have any questions?
It's sabotage.
Snorkeling all night, snorkeling in the morning.
When will the elections be held?
Tom is supportive.
Tom walked in.
I was sitting in a chair in Bern at the patent office, when I came up with a sudden idea: if a man falls free, he doesn't feel his own weight. It upset me. It led me to this gravitational theory.
Speak louder so that everyone can hear you.
A new train-influencer system is installed on the railway line.
We believe in God.
They forgot about you.
Where do we eat tonight?
He was dressed in a men's suit.
We should have taken three bottles of wine.
Can I borrow?
I can't find Tim.
Stand straight.
Thania's job is temporary.
I hope it's okay.
That's not interesting.
You've always been like that.
The sun went down below the horizon and it was dark.
Which side won?
Tom's home.
Tom cut a slice of meat and put it on his plate.
I'll try again.
You never know what's going to happen.
If all goes well, he'll graduate from college in 2001.
The decision was delayed.
That's never happened to me before.
Dani's got 3,000 flying hours.
He wiped his face with a handkerchief.
I don't understand what's so funny about this.
I'm gonna admire Tom.
That Tom left here.
I was the only one who survived.
He advised her to get used to smoking, but she didn't listen to him.
Get off my clothes!
Tom ate the rest.
Are you hungry at all?
My watch is cheaper than yours.
I can't even remember what Tom looked like.
Are you crazy or what?
We appreciate his talent.
I feel better.
The protagonist of the new film is an angel of a child.
He's in college.
Those who give up their Fundamental Freedoms for a little Transitional Security will not deserve any of them.
She's brave enough to be a girl.
He looked into her eyes.
Why don't you come with us?
Tom saw someone.
She's a real witch!
I like math.
You made a mistake.
Dani brushed his teeth with his teeth.
But yours isn't bad either.
If I were you, I'd ask her.
Do you know this man?
I have to work tonight.
Who do you think was watching TV in this room last night?
Tom wanted to keep the stolen money for himself.
I've had half a grapefruit breakfast.
I don't think there's a god.
Tom doesn't know who to believe: John or Mary.
Ageing does not mean that you should no longer use your imagination.
It was Thursday yesterday.
If I had money, I would travel the world.
The political situation has changed.
You can go first.
Tom got tired of reading and wanted to go play.
I don't know what kind of car Tomina has.
It's Sunday today.
I should have stayed out of it.
Do you have feelings for Tom?
I hate that movie.
That was yesterday.
I'll put on my shoes.
Where'd you get your glove?
It's just disgusting.
The nearest town is located behind the hills.
What are you reading now?
There are musicians and actors who hire security guards to keep their over-excited fans away from them.
Let's go to the movies now?
I know you can do this.
This is not known to Tom.
Those were his last words.
Tom's favorite sport is baseball.
I was very angry.
I was disappointed at first.
I could have done better if I had more time.
Why didn't you mention there was a witness?
You can go when you have time.
Look ahead, please.
Get this shit for yourself!
Africa is the wisest of mankind.
Too bad Tommy's leaving.
Did you talk about this, Tomina?
It'll stay between us for a while.
Do you have a lighter?
Tom's mother is still shopping for her clothes.
They're not expensive.
I knew Tom knew something.
Tom was apparently nervous.
The end of October.
Maybe he's still waiting at the station right now.
Welcome to Boston.
I'm always late.
Tom was sitting at the end of the table.
Tom was nice, but Mary wasn't.
You're better than you think you are.
I've seen more than Tom knows.
If you don't behave well, Santa won't come.
You're too young to buy a cigarette.
It was a mistake to kiss Tom.
Tom seems uneasy.
This bottle of beer is almost as big as you.
Would you like some advice?
Ah, so that's what it's about!
Zagreb is the capital of Croatia.
It's inevitable.
He's a loud guy, and he's not worth taking care of.
You two have conspired against me.
Oh, shit!
Tom needs to take better care of himself.
Why don't you take off your wrist?
Oh, please?
Tom thinks the soup's too hot.
I know the secret.
The fire burned the house.
Who's gonna do it?
Tom should have done it sooner.
He's staying at a hotel.
I loved that show.
I'll stay, I'll come down.
He told us a story about a boy, Tom Sawyer.
Tom can get away.
Anyone who doesn’t drink in a company is either a thief or a spy.
It's a scam.
This moment should never come to an end.
They were put on parole yesterday.
- Can I have a look at his ticket?
Please, give him my best regards.
Tom couldn't open the safe.
Say it in Hungarian!
Entry only for the staff.
Tominak has already managed to get through everything.
Where can we meet?
There's no right answer.
When I was a child, only the children of rich families had a spiral.
The crystal clear water was very pleasant to the temperature.
There's nothing else to do.
We know an acceptable solution.
The new school has failed to take into account the special needs of young people.
Lap, please.
Everything that happened between us was a lie?
That's a picture.
That's pretty close.
Bring it up!
I'm glad you're here, Tom.
That's what Tom told me.
Tomi's strength is like a bee, but he's still a rabbit.
We need to be Prudens.
He left without a word.
I never said that.
I don't care.
I'm just as old as I am.
I'm hungry for sugar.
I cleaned the sink.
I found something there.
Mr. Jones fell asleep because I fell asleep a little during the hour.
Henry wants to see you.
Can we eat?
I have a meeting today.
We're not leaving.
Tom didn't try to disguise the truth.
I was happy yesterday.
May I ask your name?
All claims are false.
It's my corner.
I'm sorry, but the traffic was great.
Tom should have listened to Mari.
Tom apologized to Mary for the discomfort she caused.
I'll apologize later.
I noticed she was wearing a new hat.
Hold on, please.
He left me unlucky.
I need to see it.
Don't leave me alone.
A little coffee would be great.
There are lots of flowers in the garden.
Tom laughed too loudly.
The answer was simple.
You shouldn't have come this early.
He's always asking for your opinion.
Let's do something else, let's do something else.
Collective responsibility is an irresponsibility.
The churches must learn humility, as well as teach it.
I know who lives in this house.
Who's driving?
I hid behind the candle.
Tom threw the sand off his feet.
I often speak to Tom in French.
What do you want?
It's okay.
Tom trusted his doctors.
They won't be caught off guard.
Tom rarely wins a debate.
Can you stand on your feet for half a minute with your eyes closed?
Nakamatsu smiled bitterly at the question of his own stupidity.
You can go yourself.
I'm glad Tom was able to change his name.
I know it's weird.
I was sitting on the ground.
He didn't just yell at me, he yelled at my dog.
Tom's careless.
I'm really sorry, I seem to have lost your umbrella.
It's a public beach.
Go and get Tom to eat.
That's all Tommy understands.
It looks very strange.
Are you taking any medications?
It's a boring word.
When I give you instructions, start the machine.
Many parents believe that there is too much violence on TV.
I've got my own problem!
You're busy.
You're like me.
That's quite amusing.
Can I play in my room?
All can be eaten in mushrooms, but there are, which only once.
That's very, very good.
No decision has been made yet.
How much did we prove?
Behave according to your age.
The door is not closed.
This is Tony's book.
The trains arrived on time.
He was being careful.
You know I can do it.
That's not enough.
He glanced at his cell phone and noticed that there were already three-quarters of them.
Tom was home when that happened.
I'm gonna get some sleep.
I got a nice butterfly.
The winner of the scientific prize has decided to offer the prize money for charitable purposes.
I couldn't stand it.
His name is Tom, not John.
I'm not going to school on Sunday.
I'm going on vacation next month.
I'm glad I'm not a woman.
This book is amazing.
Do you remember who I am?
Come on, everybody, dance.
He's just a man.
Can I help you, sir?
I want to know why women live longer than men do.
I can't stay in this house.
I'll pay you well.
They're both in the garden.
I put my bags in my room with my carry-on.
Is the snake alive or dead?
He could be the man I need.
I hate to say that, but Tom and Mary are right.
My pulse is irregular.
Tom was really sick.
When we got married, my parents gave me this house.
He will never lose hope.
My flashlight hit his house.
She's making herself up every morning.
Blow up the eggs!
I want to say thank you for everything you've done for me.
Tom suggested I don't do it.
I'm not happy at all.
I'm sorry about last night.
It's time to say good-bye.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
It's happened to me many times.
The trees are moving.
Tom asked Mary to come in.
It works perfectly with the iPhone.
Maybe it's a trap.
Remind him to come home early.
Tom had breakfast.
We only have enough food and water for three days.
You have a good memory.
Why are you bathing?
Ten months later, he came home.
Tom came too late.
Tom's out.
Your statements are the only ones that should be translated on this website.
What is today's exchange rate?
I think she's leaving.
Let's take a break.
It's a shame to run, but it's useful.
Sooner or later, you'll get used to the heat.
I don't.
They offered to me.
That's unusual.
In capitalism, man is not coerced into buying.
He was terrified of the horror of this terrible scene.
It's not up to me what's going to happen.
I don't like to argue.
That bike is too small for you.
Tom gave everything to Mary.
Keep trying, keep trying.
Cook an egg.
Muriel is now 20 years old.
- A drink? - Thank you, no.
He blew up the ceiling, and now it's as big as a house.
I'm reading a letter.
I don't remember asking for your opinion.
I used to sleep in an open window in the summer.
He bought a newspaper.
If you live in the suburbs, you need a car.
My pants are gone.
I'd like to help him, but I don't know how.
You're bolons.
My patience has reached its limit.
Tom brought flowers to Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a.
It's not the first time this has happened to me.
Don't fight!
I can speak Turkish.
This could be a long time.
Good morning, Mike.
Here I come.
I don't know his name.
What are your 10 favorite movies?
I'd like some things.
He's got his mind on paper.
John likes to gamble.
Waiting for Mary.
Please fix it up.
Where's Mom?
Tomi has never seen Mari so angry before.
You're under oath.
This computer is the most expensive.
They're guns.
The retreating boy has given his name away.
I wish I had learned harder when I was young.
That's the right price for it.
I need paper and pen.
I hate to iron.
Tommy's weird.
Why do you want to be a nurse?
Don't compare yourself to others.
Lunch's at noon.
We're classmates.
Will you still be here this afternoon?
At least you've been listening to me.
Tom wore shorts.
Do you have a lover?
My son has become a man.
Everybody's at risk.
Is that booked in a public library?
The defense program can't count on much good.
It's all mine.
Tom was tired.
Can I pay with a MasterCard?
Who can do that?
Don't be disrespectful.
When you wake up in the morning, you'll find something wonderful.
When's Tam<0xC3><0xA1>s coming?
I don't think I'll ever get used to Korean food.
Scientists have discovered the entire genetic stock of the breadcrumbs.
I don't know what you heard about him.
He likes fishing.
You're attentive.
Tom's gonna hurry.
The trains stopped due to heavy rains.
Tom goes to work to buy a newspaper.
I'm kidding.
Tom is very energetic.
No one laughed.
The world is a huge place.
Look at it again.
I don't have any talent.
They were treated like a child.
Oil and water are not mixed.
I'll tell you what to do.
Thomas has a few moons.
We're still trying to figure out how he escaped.
You'd be better off not doing too much.
Tomi always keeps his word.
You're gonna lose.
Please, do whatever you think is necessary.
I'd like to marry a girl like that.
The earth is shrinking.
Tom did a good job.
My neck's cramped.
Tom always does.
She showed him my picture.
It won't work for me.
Don't open it!
- What are you doing tonight?
You just got caught.
Bring up the darkness, let a little light come in.
I'll never love you.
Tom spoke.
He's got a lot of faults, but I love him more than that.
What's your number?
Tom will probably be pleased.
The lake is surrounded by green hills.
You're counting on that?
It's next to him.
I should have been there at the meeting.
It's too sweet.
We got caught up in traffic.
I'm not dead.
You know I'm gonna miss the exam tomorrow.
We know this song.
Tom, seriously.
I can win if I'm lucky.
This is communism.
Come on, let's talk about flowers.
She cried when she heard the story.
Some words are too hard for me.
Do it today, don't wait for tomorrow.
It's hard to please everyone.
He's influential.
Tomorrow's departure depends on the weather.
I'm thirty.
We don't have an example of that.
I may have made a mistake.
He's not here by accident.
That's what I've been through.
Let's not talk about it.
I'll stay home tomorrow.
Tom found an injured bird.
What's your home number?
That's the hard part.
Whatever you do, don't tell Thomas.
I'm glad you're here.
Those shoes are too small for you.
Tam<0xC3><0xA1>s gave the police a description of the person he saw.
That's where the bus comes in!
DNA was not found as evidence.
Tom's in trouble when he's buying condoms.
Do you know a good dentist?
Don't come in.
You're very rude.
Tominak is not the strength of parallel parking.
The good times are gone.
The dinner was great!
Just act like you don't know him.
You must be right.
I need a few hours of sleep.
What's wrong with you?
He intentionally broke this vase.
Take care of your little boy while his mother's gone.
I'm here to talk to Tom.
Why did you do that?
Coffee is often served in the café.
He applied for the visa.
Tom's serious.
You're different with Tom.
He likes music very much.
Tom and Marika had a good time.
It's a dictionary.
It's a real beauty.
Oh, my God, Mary, are you okay?
I know what you shouldn't eat.
The smell of this place is bad.
I can't believe that anymore.
The time was very fast.
Call Tominak!
It is another thing to learn and teach a language.
You've got to put the drink down.
It was Tom, wasn't it?
Tom made a snow angel.
An hour later, the fever was even higher.
What do you want?
I was on the bus.
I'll eat everything except for the leaves.
Don't worry about them.
I need money.
One of the dogs is still alive.
I can stand against everything, but not the temptation.
Close the door in silence.
I need cash.
That's pretty important.
We proved it.
Tom got a little red.
Here's an example.
Thank you for asking me this question.
The door opened slowly.
I did this for my health.
It's a kitchen.
How do we know that light is faster than sound?
Tomi translated the letter into French.
I want to win that game.
He lived there for about five years.
It's been 30, but it's still hanging on to your parents.
They've been married for two years.
He was in doubt about his health problems.
Within a year, my son became stronger.
That's so cute.
I think I forgot at home.
I promised my parents I wouldn't drink.
Tom said he's eating Chinese food.
We're very similar.
That was Chinese for me.
Oh, my God!
I won a lot in my car sales.
I think you've done this before.
Don't lose your patience.
The solution was there before my eyes, but I didn't notice it.
Once upon a time, once upon a time.
That's very good.
Haven't we met somewhere?
Tom speaks a little bit of French.
Tomi is the best player in our team.
It's much worse.
We can't wait any longer.
Is Paris far away?
We appreciate his talent.
Of course, Tom loves his kids.
I can't handle the stress.
We can't agree with you on this.
I'm sure she's taking care of Maria now, Tom.
Tomi can't handle the failures in place.
Mary's purse was so fine that Tom bought it twice.
There are also Christian Arabs.
I told you you'd like it, Tom.
I'm getting better every day.
That's the danger.
If there is too much work, it is a problem, but there is too much leisure time.
Tom's gonna stop.
A beautiful six-legged couple was swimming in the pond.
It was really fast.
I assured Tom I'd do it.
Of course you would.
Can I borrow thirty dollars?
I didn't get it.
This material can be ironed well.
I was in Rome.
Coming?
Tom grew up in Boston?
It's good to see you!
I feel that this page is a long romantic novel, with the main characters Tomi and Mari.
I have to follow.
I bought my house two years ago.
Grab it and put it on the fire.
Come on, admit it.
Can I kiss you?
The bad weather kept them from snoring.
I'm buying meat and vegetables.
Mary and Elke are not brothers.
I like the snow.
You can't vote unless you're 18 or older.

I didn't eat meat before.
Can you show me the book?
We are committed to the immediate implementation of this project.
A talented singer.
Do you know where Toledo is in Spain?

These are not my keys.
You are the great love of my life.
Do you really think I can help you?
What happens if we drown?
Do you read the Bible?
Tam<0xC3><0xA1>s is taking a tea break.
I can assure you, we will not make this mistake again.
May 5th is her birthday.
You really have to keep track of your jealousy, it's a living animal inside of you.
This is not what a food should look like.
Tomi's collecting the meteorites.
Tom drove the car with his knees.
What's he doing?
There's nothing you can do to stop it?
Can you stay home at the store?
First of all, don't forget to write to me.
I recognized his face.
No matter what happens, you just smile.
I'm late for the meeting because of the plug.
Why don't you sit down?
He's in school.
Burn it here.
Your help would be lost.
Wait, wait.
Don't blow your mouth.
They need you.
Thomas closed the door in front of Mary.
How long do I keep this up?
Lunch for students lasts from 11 to 1.
They got married three months ago.
I've had lunch.
How many hairs on a cat's face?
In my opinion, Esperanto is very difficult.

Tom reached into his bag and pulled out a card.
I'm not right?
Tom and Mari went to a fancy restaurant to celebrate their wedding anniversary.
Maybe Tam<0xC3><0xA1>s's been working for a long time.
Turn on the air conditioner.

From one day to the next, you don't have to save a filler.
Is your watch all right?
Thomas died of kidney failure.
Tom, where are we?
I can't dig the top of the incinerator.
Oh, thank you, that's so thoughtful.
I like this book the least.
Where do you live now?
He was intentionally injured.
Please don't lie to me.
Tommy's dancing.
Tom can sit here if he wants to.
At that time, he wasn't so tired.
Do you have enough blankets?
The boxing champion will buy a very expensive jacket. He will go to the Olympic village, lead his jacket to the wardrobe and attach a inscription: If you take my jacket, I will kill you. Olympic boxing champion. He will return to the village of Olympique in an hour and will see that he will go back to the foyer, he will see that
Tom is a great actor.
Hey, hey.
The situation has improved.
The water reached the knee.
It's actually working.
Please change the interpuncture.
Now listen to me.
I should've said I couldn't make it.
Why do you want to join the army, Tam<0xC3><0xA1>s?
He's satisfied with his new car.
The cafe is on the ground floor, two floors down.
I was born on a farm.
I have a car.
No one's gonna die.
Sunday is the last day of the week.
Thank you all for the compliments.
Just call Tomina.
I came back early.
I made Maria a toy baby.
I wish you weren't working.
Tom's not the only one.
Kyoto was the former capital of Japan.
Tomi is very kind to me, but Samine has a lot more money.
Tom drank too much.
The party's over.
Tommy did it like he didn't know anything about it.
No one is indispensable.
Tom pressed the button and waited.
I don't know why you didn't think of that before.
The heat is high at night.
With his new job, he took more responsibility.
Why are you so rude?
I wish my wife could cook!
Write down the address.
Tom is unreal.
When's this gonna end?
You met my sister, didn't you?
Tom's on his shoulder.
He wants to be a singer.
Tom was young and influential.
A martini, please.
He still loves me, and I think I love him, too.
Tam<0xC3><0xA1>s had a strange dream last night.
I wasn't thinking.
I fixed the car yesterday.
My arms hurt.
What do you got for me?
His fear was completely baseless.
My country is the whole world.
Anger is a kind of energy.
The worst has happened.

Has anything changed since then?

The accident caused a stir.
I think it was Tom who helped Mari.
She's not a virgin anymore.
Your hair is starting to fall out.
I won!
The court declared the defendant's innocence.
We're not gonna win.
Very intelligent.
The expected rain did not occur at all.
I'm in the basement.

Who?
I lost my umbrella.
I speak Esperanto as if it were my mother tongue.
Put them on the table.
Is it true that you like salt coffee?
I'm sorry.
Just do it.
I improvised.
Help yourself and God will help you.
Maybe there are other reasons.
They sell cars.
You're good at lying, aren't you?

What a day!
You were waiting for Tom, weren't you?
Then no one saw him.
Neither do I.
There's no better way.
Is it true?

I'm not as fat as I used to be.
I'll get you a beer.
We had a lot of snow last year.

I've updated my software.
Take it easy.
Can I go?
