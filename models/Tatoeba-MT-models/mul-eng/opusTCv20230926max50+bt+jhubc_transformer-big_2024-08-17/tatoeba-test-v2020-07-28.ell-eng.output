I'll get her.
Tom's selling coffee.
I guess you're Canadian.
I'm amazing.
I often have nightmares.
They're all dying.
John has two sons.
He's still here.
Australia is a fantastic country.
Someone poisoned me. I'm sorry.
Tell them I'll do it.
Mary spends most of her time in the library.
This is better than any other bag in this store.
I like the horses.
I agreed.
How much is four out of six?
I've been stalking Tom.
When were they born?
I have to go to the bank in the morning.
You tell Tom to shave his hair.
Do you think Tom did it?
We didn't play well.
Tom was hungry.
Tom loaned me his bike.
Tell them we don't want to go.
They found her.
I had nothing to do.
We're both very hungry.
We have a lot of friends.
I don't think I'm ready for the exam.
Mary answers the teacher’s question.
They'll fix him.
We don't have school tomorrow.
Rome was not built in a day.
I like to dance.
It's gonna be all right.
Why didn't you come?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We had no secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I have a green shirt.
You're much faster than me.
Tom now lives in Australia.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane. Peters loves Jane.
Keep smiling. Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow that.
Good morning.
Do you like the juice?
You seem to be disappointed.
Tom knows everything about them. He knows everything about them.
Did you sleep at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's the way it is.
We laugh a lot.
Tell me what you're gonna get for the exams.
I don't think two languages are enough.
Can you lend me your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter is a nurse.
I think we should tell them.
You should be grateful for that.
Tell him to come and see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to church by car.
You're much smarter than I am.
Who's staying?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write it all down.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm embarrassed.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's coming home at 3:00.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I'm not gonna lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom's teaching me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
The raw fish is not my taste.
Sit down. Sit down.
Do you have anyone?
He's a student of the high school Jutsou.
You'll see.
I'm not happy with that.
They lost again.
Tom would do anything for you.
It's okay?
What's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I find out where you're working?
Can someone explain it to me?
Who's she?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate the meat.
The flowers and the trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We planted the house green.
The time and place of the meeting are closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I just got promoted recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love the flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please, close the door.
The garlic is good for your health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary that he had to do it.
What would you tell her to do?
He kisses him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop.
Tom was working in Australia.
You're competitive.
I'm sick.
I wish I wasn't Canada.
What shines is not gold.
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
He's hitting my phone.
He put his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom's a head taller than me.
Where can we buy it?
It's 2:30 now.
Everybody knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was in his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadian.
Who's that?
Tom forgot his briefcase on the train. I'm sorry.
They killed our laughs.
My name's not Kuzey.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it.
The phone's ringing.
Tom lives in Boston.
Thomas lives in a community of hippies.
The water is warm.
You have to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
It was an emergency.
You're wearing expensive earrings.
Is anyone here?
Tom's the only Canadian here.
Tom's gonna live.
It was too late.
These aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers. We need more volunteers.
Are you really in Canada? !
People today attach more importance to popular culture than they did in the past.
Tom's not my friend anymore.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text into English?
Did you wash your hair?
Did Tom see you?
We're in love.
I walk every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
You shot him?
We may need a few.
That's a proposition.
How'd you spend the holidays?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them to dinner.
Oh, we've got a guest?
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find you.
What's your name?
I'm unemployed, too.
Tom's house has been completely destroyed.
Tom's got Mary.
It's from France.
Why are you angry?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
You know who he is?
Did you see baseball on TV last night?
Mary photographed her mother with her mobile phone.
I wanted to die.
It does the same to me whether it comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not about money.
Would you like to see them?
You ruined him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like humans.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I won't be late.
We need to find out what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position, please.
I've never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
Are you 18?
I want to do sports.
Tom was alive.
Thomas's phone hit, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was exorbitant.
It's about.
Where's your friend?
Do you know of any Greek myths?
He's done 40.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a dictionary of French.

He went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
She tried to throw it away with love poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not read.
Tom hugged Mary. He hugged her.
You wouldn't go to Australia to build a store?

I visited Boston many years ago.
Tom was questioning Mary.
Tom's got a twin brother.
I'll translate.
We stayed three nights in Boston.
I'm starting to find you tired.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom's wearing gloves.
The letters are written by the girl.
Someone's been screaming.
He didn't go to the lake.
He doesn't speak French fluently.
I'm taller than you.
Have you lost your proof?
Are you afraid of losing your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom will be back?
Tom doesn't have red hair.
Can I borrow your earphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm unstoppable.
I think Tom's drunk.

We're very busy.
Stronger, please.
You're mine.
Please take a breath out of your nose.
The company has cancelled the plan.
"Fire!" he shouted.
He worked hard.
I don't come here very often.
I'm gay. I'm gay.
You're easy-going.
Tom's not a hero.
I'm glad I was able to help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys are not mine.
That was the last client.
Do you like white wine?
They were wrong.
I say it and I repeat it.
Turn on the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like spiders.
I couldn't sleep.
Do you learn Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
That's not gonna happen again.

Look what I can do.
There's nothing you can do.
I don't want you to tell her.

What brings you here?

I won't lose!
It's a good investment.
The snow made it difficult to see.
Don't apologize.
Thomas's bought something.
He's got a house.
The girl has a white horse.
Tom's a little jealous.
I still want to marry you.
Now's your chance.

The best way to learn English is to go to America.
Did you think I was a Canadian?
I'll be with you.
I have not received an answer to my letter.
Can I borrow your gun, please?
Are they all ready for the trip?
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
I'm reading him.
I want to talk to Tom.
You shot him.
Tom's Turkish.
Can you take it out of ten or six?
Don't stop!

He's smart.
When are you going on vacation?
It's Anita's house.
Tell her it's urgent.

I know.
I burst into tears.
He's talking like a trucker.

Why do you hate Canada so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
Is that a horse or a carriage?
I'm grateful for what he's done.
And I'm kind of tired, too.
Are you sure you can't imagine things?
Don't apologize.
He's walking slow.
Come with us.
No one wants to take responsibility.
Is his father Japanese?
Attention, please!
Are you sure you've pressed the last button?

What time do they start?
I'm stuck right now.
I'd think about it.

Who cares?
Tell me what you want.
First of all, God

Come on out.
I wish I had been born in Canada.
You're impatient.
You're impatient.
What did you promise to do?
I wasn't in the discussion.
Please note: In English, we promote the nationalities, the days of the week, and languages.

You were guilty.
I trust you.
You wouldn't go to Australia to build shops?
How many times have you kissed Tom?

Kate almost never celebrates her birthdays.
How much do you want to pay?

Do you feel tired?

I went to London.
I love dogs.

My brother lives in Boston.
What are you reading?
Okay, thank you.
Only I can save you.

We'll make a visit to our friends.
I'm sick of frequency.
And speaking of genocides, today is Columbus Day.
Sami hired another waitress as well.
I want some orange juice.

Would you like some coffee or tea?
Tom, I'm afraid we'll find our problem.
Where's your house?
Tom wrote a lot of poems.
They've decided.
He's the one who wrote the book.
I haven't given it to Tom yet.
You're still alive.
I'll never forget this night.
I don't know if I have time.
I hope to see them.
I'm not going to reveal her secrets.
Mary answers the teacher’s question.
Tom said that he thought I looked impressed.
I eat at least once a month.
I want to have some cheese.
He shot her.

The problem is, you're not Canadian.
I'll be in the car.
What is the title of your new book?
He lives in London.
I missed the last two lessons.

Tom's leaving tomorrow.
Don't do something you'll regret.
This book is very small.
I was very hungry.
Run! Run!
They all started running.
When is Tom reading?
We're gonna kill you.
You're old enough to do it yourself.
"What would you like?" "I'd like a dog."
You're working hard.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
It's really a nice theory. The only downside I think it has is probably common in all philosophical theories. It's wrong.
Why don't I stay surprised by that?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He spends a lot of money on shoes.
Tom's decided to leave Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm very angry now.
I thought you were Japanese.
There's a lot of trouble here.
Who saw you?
They're bigger than that.
Please repeat what I'm saying.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is a continent.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
Language is the vehicle of thought.
Do you really believe these stories? No.
Mike is the highest of the three.
Did you ask them to wait?
He's lying.
It'll work.
I guess you're Canadian.
Yeah, I know.

Tom shook his head.
I met her in the store.

I want soup.
Here?
Where did you find the key?
Maybe that's not right?
Tom can't stand the hot and wet summers here and that's why he went to the mountains.
Bill, get on the phone tonight.
I'll help you in any way I can.
Please, tell me your opinion.
Tom's waiting for you.
It's Italian, isn't it?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.
He had a lot of porn magazines in his room.
Let's leave her alone.
I just got back from Australia.
Tom was very friendly.
You're drunk!
Thomas is a rich man.
Tell us about Tom.
Thank you very much.
Are you awake?
Algeria is very different from the United States of America.

Yes, it is.
It's true!
Can I use your phone?
It's from Greece.
Sometimes I understand you.
Tom was singing.
I love the taste of the mushrooms.
Tom hated Mary. He hated Mary.
Where can I buy tickets?
I was drinking a lot.
When's your birthday?
I'm not your enemy.
I've asked Tom to sign the papers.
Save them.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
I brought you something.
I made sure I was asleep.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We tortured them.
Tom was very impressive.
Mary is very protective of strangers.
We'll shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I got home.
Life is hard.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom pushed through the door.
I live here.
I hope you'll call me again.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Talk to me later.
Put the book on top of the others.
The bird is in the sky.
Tom hired Mary to do it.
Mike, how's it going?
Tom got married in Canada.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.
You want me to tell him?
You saved us.
Are you sending them a message?
Can I borrow a pencil, please?
We only have three choices.
The moon is behind the clouds.
You need to talk to Tom.
Tom used to work in Australia.
I want money.
Tom's snoring.
Do not turn off the light.
He was very happy.
Thomas was obviously unlucky.
Aren't you a teacher?
You tell him we're busy.
Tell her to help us.
Tom stayed.
Thank you, you're fantastic!

He took out his glasses.
It's good to dream.

You were late yesterday.
We're students.
Why are they angry?
I hope it went well.
I'm human.
Everybody likes the money.
Tom's talking to Mary.
Tom did a lot of great things.
There are five fish in my aquarium.
Tom's not driving fast.
Thomas is smarter than Maria.
The pen is on top of the office.
Are you going to stay?
Tom and I are getting married in October.
Sit down!
I love the gardening.
Who were you talking to?
You have to sleep.
Who broke it?
What's your complaint?
Apparently, Tom's a multi-tasker.
Wait for me there.
Why don't you help me?
Do you think you can catch me?
Tom planted three moths in his yard.
Tom claimed that he was innocent.
He's smiling.
Your face is red.
You're not ready.
Tom and Mary are coming here now.
You're not Canada.
He said something.
She advised him to take the medicine.
Tom's my older brother. He's my older brother.
Don't underestimate me.
The sofa is uncomfortable.
I'm so excited.
Are you sure Tom's not busy?
Who's sick?

Are you sure you've hit the right button?
Good evening!
Are you satisfied?
We sent the products yesterday.
You'll be jealous.
You have something on your teeth.
How often do you wash your clothes?
Tom has a high moral standard.
I accept threats.
Tom was wearing gloves.
Tom has forgiven Mary.
Tell them who we are.
You went to the casino.
Don’t be afraid to make mistakes when you speak English.
I can't help you this week.
You shouldn't say things like that when there are kids around.
I'll never forget you.
I thought you were Canadian.
We recognized them.
I heard the news on the radio.
Do you miss Tom?
His wife doesn't even know why he died.
You have to see this movie.
Drive safely, sir.
Tom knows I'm a Canadian.
I lost my card for lunch.
There was no time.
After the accident, the wounded were taken to the hospital.
We have to finish it all by Monday morning.
We have to work very hard.
As you wish!
Who are your parents?
I've been playing tennis.
And besides the others, I don't like to wear socks.
We plan to be more present at your party.
Thank you so much for coming!
Tom was singing.
He's a dancer.
What did you ask him?
He's running now.
It's too spicy for me.
What I want now is a glass of cold water.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom's handling the French pretty well.
Why did you shoot her?
Let's keep going.
I want to talk to my lawyer.
She likes the flowers.
I think they're liars.
This elevator can carry ten people at a time.
Freedom is not free.
He's teaching us French.
You're sick!
Do you think I'm a dictator?
I'm the only one who doesn't want to do it.
We have to hurry to get to the station in time.
What are Tom's priorities?
Tom has a brother in Boston.
I want to talk to you.
Tom decided to go to Australia.
Tom didn't want to do it.
Tom taught at Harvard.
It's cold; why don't you put on a sweater?
We'll save you.
Are you ready?
Only for adults.
I don't know her.
Tom was in love with Mary.
He wanted to see his boss in Tokyo before he left for America.
Come early. Come early.
How many letters did you send to Tom?
I've been seeing him for months.
I forgot her nickname.
I want you to go back to Boston.
They're crazy.
You're a liar.
We're not guilty.
I'm drinking milk.
I admire you.
I didn't go to the zoo.
These are my favourites.
One speaks English, the other speaks Japanese, and the other speaks Japanese.
When are you planning on getting married?
They're writing.
What can I do about it?
I can't imagine what it's like to be there.
It was English.
I had no doubt about it.
I'm not tired at all.
She's beautiful.
What do you want me to tell you?
Tom doesn't eat red meat.
The roads are covered with snow.
Well, I have a proposition to make.
I don't remember the exact date.
He's smart.
What are you gonna say?
He cut off the smoke.
When do you eat dinner?
Would you like a glass of red wine?
He only drinks water.
I can't forget her beauty.
Do you wash your hands before eating?
Tom's playing tennis.
Everyone has secrets.
Don't lie to me again.
I don't have a franc.
I like to help others.
What animal is big?
I'll wait until October.
Do you know how to use it?
They're lucky.
The decision is mine.
You want to tell her?
You hid the truth from me.
His response was negative.
I understand them.
You're still alive.
How old are they?
Tell her not to come.
Is Tom really Canadian? Is he Canadian?
Tom plays tennis every day.
It's not cheap.
She's a very attractive woman.
Passion is being learned.
How can we do that?
Do you think you could help me forget about the garden this afternoon?
I can't eat pork.
You're very brave.
It's on the eighth floor.
I want to go to Korea.
Tell Tom I'm for a swim.
I want revenge.
I'm tired.
Dinner's mine today.
We are willing to negotiate with you.
The girl wants to know the truth.
Have I ever asked you to work on Sundays?
I feel guilty.
I'm out of sleep.
Follow him.
I prefer coffee.
There's medicine.
It's unlikely he'll be here today.
My dad hasn't had dinner yet.
Melanie thinks the situation is very bad.
Tom ignored Mary's warning.
He's getting rich.
My girlfriend's Canadian.
If I wasn't lazy, I'd buy it.
Wait for us here.
"Do you speak English?" - "No, not yet, this is my first lesson!"
We'll die if we stay here.
Do you want to eat shrimp?
I have a friend.
He didn't understand Mary's joke.
Will you tell them?
It's very slippery.
Who brought you here?
We spent our holidays at the lake.
Who closed the door?
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?
Take my wife.
Put your clothes on here.
Is Mary your daughter?
I'm not illiterate.
I want the book.
You have to help him.
He's drinking beer.
Today is Thomas's birthday.
My wife is a doctor.
Someone gave you something.
I'm watching TV.
Tom bought an all-new car.
Tom has a lot of debt.
You have no way.
Why are you smiling?
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
Please don't touch me.
I got you a present.
You're not poor.
We're going to visit Tom.
My colleague and I are doing the same job but were promised promotion very soon.
She likes the oranges?
Are you mad at me?
You have to write a letter.
Tell her I'm ready.
I'll wash the dishes.
I like the snow, it's so nice!
Tom saw Mary today.
I was born in Boston.
They believe me.
You killed her.
They'll find her.
I'm not interested in modern art.
We killed them.
You're so beautiful!
Tom's famous.
Tom says he needs some help.
Why did you shoot them?
It took a lot more than I expected.
Who was right?
I'd like to watch TV.

Speak French.
She's married to a dentist.
We're still in shock.
It's gonna rain tonight.

Welcome to our country!
What's your favorite color?
Tell us about this.
Don't make any noise!
I'm riding once a week.
Tom's smarter.
Tom started it.
Tom doesn't know where to wait for Mary.
I still love Tom.
That's an improbable result.
I like it and I need to learn a lot of foreign languages.
I love you, Tom.
Tom's got gray hair.
We shot him.
You have three cars, don't you?
Tom will find us.
It's up to you.
I don't remember inviting you.
Tom stole Mary's watch.
What do you got there?
Tom's gonna change.

You're very attractive.
Is it legal to speak Bengali in Australia?
I don't give a damn.
He loves his son.
I'm very disappointed.
He'll protect you.

Where'd you put it?
The doctors have a difficult problem.
There are three shops in the mall.
Keep digging. Keep digging.
I like to help others.
I need a hydraulics.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?
Yankev was greatly influenced by Borekh's story.
I don't hate them.
He must be an American.
When do we have to deliver the report?
Who stole Tom's bike?
We don't want her.
This room is used as a kitchen.
Who are you referring to?
Someone's singing.
How many spring rolls did you eat?
The flower is blue.
I like this room.
If you really want to know, all you need to do is ask.
Who's that girl?
Ignore them.
He's the hero.
I didn't eat it.
Our shop is not open.
You underestimated them.
Get her out of here.
Tom stole Mary's computer.
Those candles aren't white.
The man they're talking about, he's been dead a long time.
Tom and Mary didn't agree at all.
I'm diabetic.
He's kicking me!
When was the last time you smoked?
We all agreed with Tom.
Tom's house is close to the beach.
We're going to build a wall.
This tea is good.
This is the last warning.
Give us three minutes.
You'll learn to speak English fluently!
That's fantastic!
Say it in Hungarian!
I know his address. I know his address.
I want to know when the meeting will begin.
I know he's lying.
Actually, you're absolutely right.
Do you like white chocolate? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The snakes are snakes.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
I would like to visit the ancient city of Athens.
This rope is very strong.
You'll be busy tomorrow.
Can you give me a better explanation?
Can you see the stars tonight?
Ask him when the next plane will be leaving.
You're alive.
Look around.
Tom said he knew Mary's secret.
That's the absolute truth.
Did he admit it?
I paid someone to clean my house.
I'll cook you something.
We found them.
Mary knows what she's doing.
Tom really wants to help you.
They did not understand the question.
I'm listening to music.
I'll call you in an hour.
I'm done writing.
I'm in Boston.

Where can I find an ATM?
Let's thank him.

How was your trip to Australia?
I'll find her.
I work at a bank.
I want to go see a movie.
They're teachers.
You're perfect in everything.
I want to know what that's called.
Tom's gone.
Why are you so disappointed?
You have to ask Tom to help Mary.
Call Tom at 2:30.
The dog fell asleep on the deck.
They need you.
How old are your brothers?
Tom bought a car at Mary's.
It's almost summertime.
I guessed it right.
Tom went to Boston to study.
I'll show you.
He wants to live in the city.
I'll never see you again.
From now on, you will need to read more.
I've never had that kind of problem.
Did we win?
I'm not very good at this.
Were you alone?
I don't blame anyone.
I'm missing Tom.
I have to go to sleep.
Tom hasn't called yet.

I need money.
Were you in the army?

Don't leave me here alone.
He's a good athlete.
Tom's my friend.
Tom's parents were married in Boston.
What did Tom show you?
Are you drunk?
This morning I woke up early in the morning.
Tom stayed.
I'm going to the beach.
The bus just left.
I was in the mountains.
I'm starting to get used to living in Boston.
Life isn't a story, if you lose your shoe in the middle of the night, you're drunk.
Tom's reading French.
She's lucky.
Has the new coach improved the quality of the team?
We left at 2:30.
Let me do my job.
Smoking is not allowed in the school grounds.
I'm not asking for money.
Don't tell me you're sorry about me.
Which way did he go?
Tom can't walk.
I'm proud of my brother.
I don't believe what Tom says.
Are we leaving now?
You'll find out.
I want to see them again.
They killed him.
You're older than me.
We're doctors.
You think you could help me get the farmyards out of the garden this afternoon?
Is Tom hungry?
I'm ready to go.
Who's dead?
Tom runs every day.
Tom couldn't figure out why Mary had made that decision.
You're Canadian, aren't you?
I'll have to tell them.
Have you read this book?
Tell them I'm not here.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
That's right.
We're honest.
I woke up at five.
Tell them we'll be ready.
Who taught you French?
Tom had a black cat.
I'll buy one.
Tom would never have done that.
Tom lit three candles.
We'll kill.
Are you texting him?
I'll show you the city.
I want to close the door.
Why did you do that?
He's lost in the woods.
How far is it from Brno?
Let's hope it works.
Tell them you're sick.
I was hiding.
He's a jackal, isn't he?
What are you going to eat today?
Tom's a Canadian.
Did you kiss?
We've been warned.
Tom has a lot of brains.
Wait here.
In his eyes, it was perfect.
Can you find him?
He is strong, brave, and above all, kind.
They're Canadians, aren't they?
I'll teach you French.
Tom's singing pretty well.
I was so tired.
You were perfect.
Tell him it's important.
Why did you do that?
I'm eating.
Try to stay still.
I admire you.
Tom has come to Japan from Australia.
That's my best friend.
Let's talk about these.
Your father won't buy it.
He may have his flaws, but I'll take him.
Tom's lost a book.
"There's going to be live music at the picnic." "What kind of music?"
He made tea.
I'd like you to come over to the meeting tomorrow.
Don't talk to me about religion.
They don't understand me when I speak German.

I'm not blaming anyone specifically.
Tom was happy.
Your wife is teaching me Italian.
I speak a lot of languages.
Tom shot them.
We're trying.
Is that a spinach?
You're leaving, I've got a face in the dark of the night, so I'm guessing it's going to trigger a pregnant semen.
I got out of the bank with my hands off.
Why don't you tell them?
He's asleep?
Where's the school?
I'm not interested in politics.
Are you crazy?
I'm so tired.
What do you want me to do?
Do you understand them?
Tom's never used the Internet.
When did you start using contact lenses?
If I wasn't lazy, I'd buy it.
Sometimes he comes home late.
We were in Boston.
Just a minute, please.
I can't forget her smile.
I'm going home today.
I have sunglasses.
We have the best food in town.
I had a difficult year.
What do they want?
Anna can't find a job.
This man is not my husband.
Tell them we're busy.
You shot us.
Here's my album.
What kind of fruit is red?
Tom and Mary agreed with us.
He's stronger than me.
Everybody likes the money.
Get Thomas. Get him.
I'm older than he is.
Tell him why you can't go.
You guessed it right.
Life is like a big highway.
There's yogurt in the fridge.
The bus goes to the house.
Bring Thomas in.
Where's the post office?

Make sure he doesn't be late.
Stay in your car.

Tom will forgive us.
Tom says he saw who was staring at Mary's car.
You're welcome.
Do you love me?
He's never been to Okinawa again.
What did he do with all the money?
Where's Tom?
The Committee on Urban Planning has accepted our proposal.
You're the only Canadian in our school.
My dog is smaller than yours.
My father died ten years ago.
Tell her why.
You're not thirty.
Because I hate you.
I love Lian.
Tell me why Tom was absent.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Why don't you try talking to the police?
I don't trust this driver.
You won.
Mary gave birth to a boy.
Were you alone?
I'm 25 years old.
Don't take off your mask.
Tom ate.
Where's my pencil?
He's dead.
I'm not gonna tell anyone about her.
Tom's teaching me French.
Tom's a dancer.
You're rude.
I know it was you.
Tom and Mary said they don't have to do it again.

The girls are working.
They say they want to talk to you.

We have to leave him here.
Where do Mary and Tom live?
I missed you.
Security's down.
I'm very happy now.
What time did you come back?
Tom was trying to kiss Mary.
He blackmailed me.
Let's talk.
Tom gave a gift to Mary.
Read it and answer it.
Do you know where Holly is?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about this.
I can't believe it's already been three years.
Where did you find the keys?
Some people do bad things. They do bad things.
You're not listening.
No one trusts you.
Give me your names.
What exactly did Tom do?
I'll meet you at the hospital.
Searched for it in Wikipedia.
I wasn't here last week.
Tom found me.
He's my son.
That student's Tom.
You're mature.
Because I hate you.
I have evidence.
I take a bath every other day.
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Who sent it?
I gave him my address.
I'm drunk.
Peter opened the door.
They killed her.
Have you been happy?
Tom doesn't like beer.
Tell me how you went to the exams.
I ran home.

Ton hired.
Do you think Tom's gonna help us?
Eat the soup now that it's hot.
Karlos climbed the mountain.
Tom stole his ring. He stole his ring.
Tom was fighting with Mary.
I can't promise you anything.
Tell him I'll do it.
Guys, thank you so much for coming today!
Tell him I'm busy.
He wants to know the truth.
You can't eat here.
It's eight to four.
A small trek in front of the stage is normal before a concert.
Let's do it!
We worked like ants.
I went abroad.
You'll like it.
Now it's up to you.
Tell him I'm busy.
I didn't sleep.
He's been missed by the news.
Do you like the snow?
This is Tom's.
When did you graduate from Harvard?
You want them?
To forgive others is an act of kindness towards yourself.
I'm unlucky.
We haven't talked to Tom yet.
We stopped at the gate.
I lost my dog.
You have to wait.
We need you here.
Tom said he liked the idea.
Tom's just back from Australia.
You want me to tell her?
This incineration came from boiling water.
Mr. Jackson is teaching us French.
They're too big.
Please, just give me this book.
Did you buy a return ticket?
I touched her.
Don't leave me here alone.
You have to listen to me.
I'll be waiting for you at 2:30 here.
Do you know how to use it?
Ten minus two is equal to eight.
I feel happy.
Why are you lying?
There are a lot of words I don't understand.
We've got to fix things.
Mary saw Tom get out of the hotel with Conchita.
Have you been happy?
You have to write a book.
Thomas is Mary's husband.
It's very boring now.
The bread is fresh.
The animals are running.
Tom's translating too late.
I think you know who I am.
Your family needs you.
Get dressed.
The paper is white.
He was wearing a vest.
We both drank a lot.
Tom broke it.
We need paper.
What's missing?
Hit me.
Don't be shy, talk to me.
Are you busy?
What is this?
He's not married.
Bob helped me.
My language is complex.
They've been denied.
Stop squeezing.
I want to go to school.
You're kidding?
Tom opened the kitchen's locker.
Try this sweet from strawberry gravy.
Hold the bowl with both hands.
Tell her I'm busy.
All airplanes have wings.
That's a straw.
I guess you're better than Tom.
Don't lie to me!
Tom wasn't busy at all.
We want meat.
When was the last time you did something for the first time? Think about it.
I'll stay.
She doesn't like this game.
Tom's gonna tell the truth.
Open the box.
Are you home?
I couldn't find the address of my hotel.
Did you break him?
Do not leave the doors open.
I like the honey.
Don't touch the dog's tail.
This is the worst hotel in town.
Keep your eyes closed.
Tom was happy that everyone had enough food to eat.
Where'd you get your stuff?
Who did you give it to?
Tell her to come here.
Amelia lives in Melania's house.
Would you like to learn French?
Did he kiss you?
Tell her I'm sick.
Who are you working for?
You're my friend.
Which one of these is your book?
It's superlative.
Did Tom have a gun?
We're no longer friends with Tom.
Tom was happy.
Did you sleep here?
There are islands in the sea.
How many do you want?
We tortured them.
Can I?
The price of coffee has fallen.
I like that moov shirt.
To grow properly, these plants need a soil that does not contain much moisture.
You want me to tell them?
They believed you.
Tell her you lied to her.
Self-designed.
I can't read this.
Can I borrow your earphones?
He's not there.
We have what we deserve.
I like these.
It's too hot, I'll light up the air conditioner.
Tom went to the curb.
You can sit down, if you want.
What's your favorite dessert?
Go ahead and make room for the others.
Tell her you don't need him.
I'd like to try something new.
I haven't seen him lately.
They'll catch us.
Don't worry.
Give me some time.
Amylia stole my heart.
Do you need sunglasses?
Does he speak English?
Tell them to come home.
Take them with you.
I'd like to see it.
We met him by going there.
I have to tell him.
Are they poisonous?
My choice will be next Saturday, November 29, 2014, at 10:30 a.m.
When did Tom get those shoes?
I don't know where Tom's socks are.
Tell them I'm not gonna do this.
I'm not very good at this.
I was hoping to see Tom.
Here we are, all Canadians.
Tom made some mistakes on the test.
Tom's cooking.
I was scared.
It is better to teach someone how to fish than to give them a fish.
I was so angry.
I get it.
Honestly, I don't like it.
Tom's gonna obey.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right track.
It makes me laugh.
I'm at a friend's house.
Have you slept at all?
I thought it was a bad dream.
We know what the problem is.
It seems unfair to me.
I'm from Mexico, I'm fluent in Spanish.
I have a special relationship with my aunt.
I need your help. I need your help.
Tom wanted me to learn French.
What are Tom's chances of winning?
Tom doesn't need a lawyer.
Do you speak Spanish?
You're weak.
Where's the paper?
He went home on foot.
Tom's gonna cry.
Where does he live?
When are you coming?
We're ready to help.
Are you ready?
Make sure they don't come.
It's not expensive.
The knife on the table wasn't sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my succulent.
Is this your car?
I kissed her.
Tom arrived here last night.
Who asked you?
We flew from Boston to Chicago.
Is this where the bus stops?
Stop him.
Tom decided to stay until 2:30.
Tell her it's important.
I like to sing.
Tom lost all his money.
What do you say to Tom?
Tom has something to tell you.
How many hours did Tom work last night?
Why are we poor?
Tom's naked from the middle and up.
I hope they find Tom.
I'm waiting for you from both of them.
Bring them with you.
Give me your money.
What can you say in English?
French is not an easy language.
It's not my fault.
Can you answer that?
I have to be there before 7:00.
How many oranges did Tom eat?
"What do you want to know?" "Always."
Tom continued to help Mary.
Tom's going to graduate in October.
Tom's gonna help Mary.
Close the window before you go out.
I wasn't at his funeral.
I didn't think it would be that easy to do it.
Hold on a second.
Tom's gonna catch Mary.
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?
I'm your doctor.
Look at that tall building.
The city has changed a lot since then.
They're ours.
Our team's got good players.
I always put my team first.
I have a lot of friends who live in Boston.
That's not a fish.

I don’t have time to read books.
Tell them why.
What color is your car?
No one's been going out for such a long time.
Tell her I'm innocent.
I'm unemployed.
Looks like he'll probably win the first prize.
What are you gonna drink?
I have nightmares.
It's burning the car.
If I wasn't lazy, I'd buy it.
They seem to have hired the referee.
Let's learn French.
Wow! The pool in this restaurant is really good!
I have to admit, I'm shaking.
Are these Tom's notes?
Tom's starting to hit a target.
I'd like a ticket to Boston.
Open up your books.
You're the only Canadian in our school.
The author formulates his or her opinion, supporting it in academic research. . . .
They're here.
Please, give me a proof.
The cockroaches are insects.
It's unlikely he's coming today.
We have to hurry to get to the station in time.
I've already talked to Tom about this.
They're not happy.
I'll kill you.
I'm not gonna lose it.
They're red.
Why did you leave the door open?
I felt like a machine with so many people looking at me.
I'd like your help.
Tom will stay in Boston for a while.
Life is not fair.
You want me to tell her?
You're not Canadian.
Where's the paper?
One of my dreams is one day to see the North Sea.
Don't stand near me.
No one's staying there.
You'll be fine without me.
They're multiplying like rabbits.
He always smokes.
You have to learn to be more careful.
All the girls love Tom.
I hope you didn't tell her.
We're missing them.
They're gonna die.
Why do you like me?
I just ate, that's why I'm not hungry.
Does Tom live in Boston?
You're very rich.
Where does Tom work?
Tom's gonna kill you.
Have you fed the horse?
Amelia is a teenager.
Tom asked me to stay.
Give me a proof, please.
Do you work on Monday?
Tom's starting to drink.
I'll swim.
I'm sending him a message.
Stop them with you.
You told him.
We won't win.
You forgot your umbrellas.
I'm from Malta.
Tom's from Harvard.
What would you do if you were in my position?
Who told them?
We've been studying all afternoon.
He died at the age of 54.
I'm from Turkey.
Tell them to come home.
Why is that baby crying?
What sweet?
I don't have to cook it.
I remember them.
I'll order some food.
My car's dirty.
We didn't help them escape.
I know a lot of Canadians.
Tell 'em we're busy.
I'll never forget this night.
She's cutting me down.
I like to solve mysteries.
Today is Saturday.
Tom, come here quickly!
Tom's getting married to Mary next week.
Take a book and read it.
Where's my book?
I like the flowers.
Do you drink green tea?
I've seen it.
Everyone can play.
What color is your truck?
Are we down?
Who did Tom save?
The doctor advised me not to work so much from here on out.
Give Tom a warning.
I'm afraid of cats.
Tell me what to do.
What exactly are you going to do with this?
Tom drinks a lot of beer.
Are you drunk?
In college, we were competing against each other.
Tom hugs Mary and kisses her.
She became a teacher.
They'll fix it.
I'm sorry about that, I think it was unfair.
We have to work together.
I'm very shy.
I'll tell Amelia.
Stop right now.
We are faced with a difficult situation.
We grew up together.
Where were you in 2003?
They did.
The property is a theft.
I guess you're Canadian.
We're on a diet.
This one's a jab.
I'm talking about you.
I have something to tell you.
Please don't interrupt me.
Why'd you lie to me?
It is the third largest city in Serbia.
Tom doesn't have a lot of books.
We all speak French.
He spends a lot of money.
Don't open this box.
Did Tom kill himself?
Who's crying?
The exceptions confirm the rule.
Call the doctor!
He was playing piano.
These are ours.
The Greeks often eat fish as well.
You want to tell her?
I'll see you later.
Ask Tom to help you.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
The house was empty.
Did you know that both Tom and Mary have homes on Park Street?
I'm very tired.
The dog is white.
Tom knows us very well.
I bet Tom knows the answer to that.
Do you run every day?
I think someone's calling you.
Tom and I are Canadians, too.
I'm usually pretty patient, though.
Is Tom home?
I like these two.
I was born in Israel.
Someone's poisoned them.
It's totally my fault.
Those gloves don't fit me.
You're young.
Do they sell flowers at this store?
He's brave enough to go there alone.
We'll get it.
We'll get out of here, don't worry.
Their father had a big shoe store in town.
Tom's trying.
He made me a cake.
How many have you killed?
I made two.
We haven't seen Tom in weeks.
We're the champions.
It was from Australia.
I need your car.
We've both been very busy.
They recognized him.
Tom's wearing white socks.
Tell Tom we'll be ready.
Can I talk to the doctor?
When I was sick, Tom passed by and cooked dinner for me.
I love her and she loves me.
Were you happy?
Our teacher is an idiot.
Thomas's shopping.
Kraas, please.
I was asked to resign from the company.
Tom's talking fast.
He doesn't want me to talk about it.
Tom knows I'm a Canadian.
I'm very strict about that.
Where's Paris?
You're stronger than they are.
Her mother lives alone in the countryside.
Tom's supposed to learn French.
I have to hide.
You don't understand women, Tom.
Tom loves baseball. He loves baseball.
Let Tom swim. Let him swim.
Tom's good at math.
I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave.
You're not gonna find us.
I'm not sure.
The drug should be applied locally.
Everybody's talking about you.
No, that's all.
Tom knows the truth.
Hold your breath.
I'll read it.
Did you think I was a Canadian?
Give me some water.
Tom recognized Mary’s voice.
I can't believe Tom ate all the chicken on his own.
Are you ready for spring?
Tell her you're not ready.
Is Laurie home?
We'll try again.
The mother tongue of Julia is Italian.
That'll help.
I cheated on them.
We're all Canadians.
I can't forget her.
Tom doesn't live here anymore.
I'm not on Tom's side.
Why didn't you warn Tom?
Tom's been terrorizing Mary.
I go to Algeria a lot.
Where are you going, Tom?
You'll regret it!
Religion is a controversial issue for a lot of people.
I don't appreciate his behavior.
I'll be waiting for you at 2:30.
Most of them are Canadians.
Tom will forgive you.
Stop her.
