Council member (AM) Wales worries 'looks like a doll'
There are concerns among some AMs on the suggestion of their title should be changed to MWP (Member of Parliament of Wales).
It came about because of plans to change the name of the trial to the Parliament of Wales.
The entire political spectrum is concerned that it may lead to hostility.
An AM of the Labour Party said, his party took care of ‘he accepted with ‘Twp' and ‘Pwp'.'
For readers outside of Wales: In Wales, ‘twp' means ‘crazy' and ‘pwp' means ‘najis.'
AM of Plaid said the party as a whole was "unhappy" and had proposed an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative said his party was ‘open minded' about the name change, but stated it was a brief oral jump from MWP to Boneka.
In this context, the letter ‘w' in Welsh is called the same as the English Yorkshire designation for the letter ‘u.'
The Council Commission, which is drafting legislation to introduce a name change, said: "The final decision on any buyer called a Council Member must be a matter for the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowers the Council of Wales to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public consultation on proposals that received widespread support to call the council as the Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the AM title, the Commission is favored by Members of Parliament of Wales or WMP, but the MWP option receives the most support in public consultations.
The AM seems to suggest an alternative option, but is struggling to reach a deal and could topple Chief of Staff, Elin Jones, who is expected to hand over a draft law on the changes within weeks.
The law on renewal includes other changes in the way the council works, including regulations on the loss of AM qualifications and the design of the committee system.
AM will get the final vote on what to call when they discuss the law.
Macedonia makes a vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to 'Northern Republic of Macedonia.'
The popular vote was set up in an effort to settle a decades-long dispute with Greece's neighboring country, which has its own territory called Macedonia.
Athens has long confirmed that the name of its northern neighbor represented demands on its territory and has repeatedly denied its membership offers to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the vote on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was just a price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Palace is silent because the churches are in Harlem.
“The parents I met said, according to history, there were bars and churches in every corner of the street,” Adams said.
"Today, they're both gone."
He said the loss of the bar was understandable.
"People are socializing in a different way now," he said.
"No longer be a living room in a neighborhood where people will always go."
For the church, he feared that the sale of assets would not last as long as the leader expected it, "and slowly they would return to where they started."
The churches, he said, could be replaced with apartment buildings and condominiums inhabited by people who do not want to help maintain the sanctuary that still exists in this neighborhood.
"The majority of people who will buy a condominium in this building are white people," he said, "and therefore will make these churches completely closed because it is unlikely that most people who enter this condominium will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by whites before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
The black church that had worshiped nearby had taken possession of the building's property.
St. Martin has been taken over by the Blacks under Honorable John Howard Johnson, who presided over a merchant boycott at 125th Street, a major avenue for shopping in Harlem, who opposed the taking or promotion of the Blacks at work.
The fire in 1939 caused the building to be badly damaged, but as Pastor Paderi, Johnson made plans to rebuild, they ordered the bell tower.
David Johnson, the son and successor of Paderi Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called the tower bells “the bells of the poor people.”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: ‘Cultural wealth’ and ‘an instrument of history that cannot be replaced.’
Experts, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that it was the first bell in the world to be played by black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has been played at St Martin for the past few months has become a hassle to architects and contractors, some people brought in by church leaders, others by Episcopal bishops.
The Vestri room - the governing body of the church, which consists of a public leader - wrote to the bishop in July with concern that the bishop "will try to approve the cost" for the vestry, although the vestry room was not involved in the taking of architects and contractors brought in by the bishop.
Some members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency in the bishop's part.
An eagle injures a 13-year-old boy while diving for coral reefs in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived into a coral reef in California on the opening day of the coral reef season, officials said.
The attack took place before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the slave screaming for help and then rowing along with a group of people to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said at first he thought it was just a fun cry to catch coral reefs, but he "realized that the boy was screaming, "I have to bite!
I've got to bite!"
The whole of his jawbone was crooked and open," Hammel said he noticed when he got the slave.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The child was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told media briefings that sharks had been found in the area a few weeks ago, but he had made sure the shark species were harmless.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles says there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury took Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams from the beauty style room in a suburban building controlled by expert assistants.
As part of a hard-hitting effort to enter the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion UK beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion sales and home appliances return, larger beauty spaces will be tested in 11 buildings across the country and taken to more buildings next year if it makes a comeback.
"Investments in beauty emerge when the big market is looking for ways to use the rack space that was previously charged for TV, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double its beauty offerings to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The range of products available from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with the same branded parts as those available in stores like Boots.
The wholesale market also relaunched a variety of Boutique so that the majority of its products are vegan-friendly - something that is increasingly in demand by buyers from young people.
Fragrance Shop fragrance oil traders will test the concessions at two Sainsbury markets, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week while the second of which opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and moving towards buying a little food every day at a local grocery store means the big market needs to work harder to convince people to come.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the branch would look like a multi-storey building as the big market chain tried to counter Aldi and Lidl's big business with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has put Argos's branches in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several places since he bought both chains two years ago, said it has increased retail sales and made profits more profitable.
The previous market wanted to change the essence of beauty and pharmaceuticals that ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested the same venture as Boot in early 2000, but the partnership ended after arguing over how to split income from pharmacy stores in its wholesale market.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmacy stores to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Lloyds said he played a role in the plan, adding a variety of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy within the four buildings.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We've changed the look and look of our beauty space to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest with specially trained friends to be willing to offer advice.
Our various brands are designed to meet every need, and an attractive environment and comfortable location means we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the long-standing way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'bought' after Holly Willoughby withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11 million bid
Peter Jones, Dragons' Den star, 'bigger' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for household items and accessories from the Truly Brand.
The pair's business was likened to the Goop brand by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The broadcaster This Morning, 37, used Instagram to announce that she would stop.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones, in a state of rage by pulling out of the lucrative lifestyle brand business at the end of the day - to focus on her new extraordinary contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "overwhelmed" when the successful TV woman admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new offer - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she didn't have time to devote household goods and accessories to the Truly brand.
The business has been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce he was about to leave Truly, Jones flew out of Britain towards one of his holiday homes.
The source said: "During this time, Truly became Holly's priority.
It will be his long-term future that can see him over the next few decades.
The decision to pull out all the people involved was really surprising.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, it's so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of stuff in Marlow's office that's ready for sale."
Experts believe the delivery of this morning, which is among the most acceptable stars in banks in the UK, could hurt millions of firms due to large investments in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes and household items, and potentially to suspend its launch.
It could be the end of that friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children and husband Dan Baldwin has been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined him as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones had a 40% stake in Baldwin, a TV publishing firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as an ITV lawyer in the I'm A Celebrity' program.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on his business."
"We're in love and then we're in love"
He joked about the criticism that would be received by the news media for making a review that would in part be considered “unreasonable to the president” and very positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up too much?
Trump said by congratulating “newsreaders.”
"I never gave up."
He said Kim was interested in the second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June had been named by Trump as a major step towards the cessation of North Korea's nuclear program.
But the nuclear deterrence talks have been stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "similar response" from the United States about the North's initial gun violence movement.
On the contrary, he said, the U.S. continued its restrictions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his meeting speech.
“Our relationship with North Korea is good,” he said.
“We will fight with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
We have a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to a positive decision - ending the missile tests, helping to free the hostages, and bringing the American military corpses home first to the water.
And he maintained his extraordinary approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this dense arena, we're going to have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him directly.
Indonesia Tsunami and Earthquake Destroying Islands, Killing Hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, a non-governmental organization said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disasters have been declared, as a condition to ensure international assistance.
"In many situations, unfortunately, they obviously don't ask for international help, so it's a bit challenging," Ms. Sumbang said.
While Save the Children together in one team goes to Palu, it's not certain whether foreign personnel can work at the scene.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Based on the earthquake that Indonesia often faces, the country remains unprepared to face natural disasters.
Although a tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it's not an ordinary sight on another beach.
The lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although the warning has been strong, it seems to contribute to the loss of life.
At its best, travel between the islands in Indonesia is certainly challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach a new disaster location.
President Joko Widodo has made bad infrastructure improvements the main thing in his election campaign, and he has given high provisions on highways and railways.
But the lack of funding has hit Jokowi's administration as he faces next year's re-election.
Jokowi faces pressure from the mazhab tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have received a more conservative understanding of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes because Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using spears, bows and arrows, and other weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge equals position against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring one goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a transmission from Xherdan Shaqiri when about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal with his team ahead of 1-0.
He kicked the ball to the left before kicking towards a distant goal net.
The attempt blew up high above the goal goal goal as it drifted towards the top right corner of the net.
Eventually the ball falls over the Arrizabalaga that jumps and falls into the net.
"He's just trying to get into that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always bring the ball as far as possible, so I'm trying to spare as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and make a match and didn't think long and then hit on."
Chelsea advanced 1-0 in the semi-finals after netting in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues forward sent the ball back to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before settling in the middle of the field and running into the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic can deliver and deliver quickly in the middle.
He then released a beautiful kick, bringing Hazard into the goal goal goal.
The danger passes the defence and netted the goal away with a left foot kick past Liverpool player Alisson Becke.
Liverpool beat Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 pm Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea faced Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday night in London.
Death toll from Indonesia's tsunami increased to 832
The death toll from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people are reportedly trapped under a collapsed building in a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit Friday and triggered a 20-foot wave, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, is filled with debris from the collapsed building.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for allegedly murdering a woman who was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been carried out after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with the effect of a stabbing at Grayson Mews on John Street, with a 32-year-old man arrested for suspected murder.
Police have urged people in the area to see or hear anything to show up.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still at an early stage but I appeal to anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears something suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the back of the dashboard camera to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed the woman whose body was found was a local citizen of Birkenhead and she was found inside his home.
In the evening, friends who believed they knew the woman had arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Police said the investigation was underway, they were in the process of informing the victim's heirs.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just tried to get into his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was shocked when he found out what was going on.
Residents were told the investigation took hours before they were allowed back in.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman appears at the scene in a state of crying.
He kept repeating "it's so horrible."
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and another van outside.
Some officers stood inside the cordon monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers indefinitely on 0800 555 111 to log 247 from September 30.
Cromwell statue of Parliament becomes the latest memorial to be struck by 'history of rewriting'
His removal would be a poetic justice to the destruction of his Talismans with so many British artifacts and religions carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as 'stupid' and 'trying to rewrite history.'
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inescapable in today's discussion of the removal of statues to which Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster would be a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil war was either not directed or run by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of Thomas's ancestors in the last century.
The beautiful representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft against Cromwella is evidence of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered to be much, more numerous in the late 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender of external pressure, in the situation of course monarchy.
Whether it is a full representation being the subject of continuous historical discussion.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict has shaped the development of our next country, and Cromwell is an individual known as a figure representing a divided section.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and commemorated."
Pigs roamed Chinese farmers until they died
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, known by his family name "Yuan," was found dead with a broken artery, filled with blood near a market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou region, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject the vaccine into pigs on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and found a pig's door open.
He said in the pig cage was a large male pig with his mouth bleeding.
Forensic examinations confirm that 550 pounds of pork has plagued farmers to death, according to the report.
"his family" Wu, "said, as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the store at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Night News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials reportedly were negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of human-attacking pigs have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with a critical injury.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig stuck a Welsh farmer to his tractor so that his wife drove the animal away.
After Oregon ranchers were eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that pigs aren't always aggressive but blood taste can act as "pencetus."
They're just playing.
They're nippers, very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to pay the right amount of respect," he said.
Rosa's Flood Brings Widespread Heavy Rain to the Southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Taufan Rosa is getting weaker as she moves into cold water on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rain in northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. on the coming day.
Rosa has winds of 85 mph, Category 1 storms up to 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trench that began to form in the Pacific Ocean and moved east toward the US West Coast as Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, she began to reject the tropics northward to the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical humidity interacted with the rift approaching which created heavy rain in the Southwest the following day.
Within the country, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris flow and land collapse likely in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially more than Arizona.
Flash floods may be in severe conditions due to tropical rainfall.
It is highly recommended to dive into the desert with tropical rain threats.
Heavy rain can cause canyons for violent rivers and thunderstorms that will bring the country strong winds and dust blowing.
Plunge approaching will bring heavy rain on the southern coast of California.
The amount of rain more than half an inch may occur, which can lead to small debris flows and slippery roads.
It became the first rain in the region in the dry season.
Several tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona through Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes further behind Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last on Wednesday.
In October you can see some hot changes across the U.S. when the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropical area remains a bit warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes with short-range temperatures.
There is a great example of a temperature difference through the U.S. center on Sunday.
There is a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the heat of the summer will try to build and develop again.
Most central and eastern U.S. states are expected to witness a warm start until October with the 80s extending from the South Plains to the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is an estimated 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a high chance of temperatures above average for the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people witnessed the shocking testimony on Thursday by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting was alleged to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with broadcasters disrupting regular programming for Friday's last-minute touchdown: an agreement designed by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 per cent sure Kavanaugh was cheating on him and tried to open his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his statement, said 100 percent definitely did not happen.
It was probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday watching it.
The company counts the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers are not immediately available for other networks that show PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching in the office.
To put it in perspective, it's the audience's size is the same as a football game or an Academy Award.
Fox News Channel, which claims hosts have supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers while listening throughout the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The benefits remain high after hearing.
Flake was the main character in this Friday drama.
After a simple Republican official issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was arrested as a CNN and CBS camera on Friday morning shouted by protesters as he tried to climb the elevator to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood with his eyes for a few minutes as he preached, aired live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He said, "You have power when a lot of women don't have power."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator was closed, he would say a lot to the committee's hearing.
The network of cables and broadcasts all covered hours directly later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh's candidacy to the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would see charges against next week's appointees, an urgent minority Democrat.
Flake is confident of part of the conversation with his friend, Sen. Chris Coons.
After the Coons and a few senators' conversations afterwards, Flake made a decision.
This Flake option does have power, as it is clear the Republican will not have the vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accuses critics of 'playing politics' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union "playing politics" with Britain's future and affecting the country's interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson stressed his alleged attack as Checkers for Brexit, saying Britain and the EU's proposals should collect tariffs each "completely unreasonable."
Wayde Sims shooter: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson with death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was detained and placed in prison on charges of killing two degrees, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video about the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost an eye mirror during the fight.
Police recovered the mirrors from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After barking at Simpson, police said he claimed Wayde shot dead physically.
The bond has been set at $350,000, Peguadefera reports.
Eastern Coroner Baton Rouge officials issued an initial report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department credits Louisiana State Police officers, state police crime labs, South University Police and local people in assisting with investigations leading to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcement for its "sustainability and justice efforts".
The Sims are 20 years old.
6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time," Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
Dust spewed from the volcano Popocatepetl to the southern area of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity rose in the crater and it registered 183 emissions of gas and dust for 24 hours.
The center monitors a variety of earthquakes and earthquakes.
Images on social media show a thin layer of glass front of the car on the roof of an ash layer in residential areas in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists are aware of an increase in activity on a volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the country since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan conspiracies ahead of Catalan independence anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands attended demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization election.
A group of masked pro-apartheids held by riot police pounded them with eggs and released paint powder, making dark clouds on the streets that tourists used to come to.
The clashes also took place later with police using their sticks to fight.
A few hours later the pro-independence group chanting "Don't forget, no forgiveness" faced the Unionist protesters screaming, "Spanish Life."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence region a year after the October 1 vote was declared illegal by Madrid but welcomed by Catalans.
Voters chose their whole to be free, although the percentage of out-of-vote is low with those opposed to separation largely boycotting the vote.
Catalan authorities said nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the election at polling stations across the region in a violent battle.
The pro-independence group camped on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the country's police.
The demonstration took place but had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer expects Catalonia's prospects to gain independence.
"Last year we went through one of our best moments of life.
I see my parents crying happily because they can vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Although management is important if it approaches victory in a regional election last December, the pro-independence Catalan party has struggled to maintain this year's momentum with their many famous leaders either in exile or in detention to await trial for their role in organizing the referendum and declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded objections to police support on her phone, said the conflict had been voiced by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced he would contest next year's European Parliament elections.
"Competition as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn regression in the values of democracy and oppression that we see from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the same car drove into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Det Insp Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the door and the building itself.
Crossroads A may also have fired a shot at the car at one time.
Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston wins
Livingston's rise surprised Rangers to hand over Steven Gerrard to a second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack proved to be different when Gary Holt's forces moved with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team remains undefeated in this season's Premiership and faces the head of the Hearts, which they will track with eight eyes, next Sunday.
Prior to that, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended the unbeaten run in this part to six games, with head coach Holt still feeling a loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a chance against the opposition.
Holt's forces were supposed to be far ahead before scoring, with their involvement causing the Rangers to face all the problems.
Scott Robinson broke it but gave up his efforts over the goal, but Alan Lithgow could only give up his efforts after slipping into Craig Halkett's stable.
The hosts are eager to let the Rangers play in front of them, realizing they can give trouble to the opponent with the set pieces.
And that’s how important goals are.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston opened a curtain, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to set Menga, who took touch and a net of goals from the center of the box.
At that point, Rangers had mastered ownership but had found a home defense that couldn't penetrate goalkeeper Liam Kelly for the most part no problem.
The fight continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to be saved.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow scored from another Livingston match.
Crosses continued to enter the Livingston box and continued to clear, while two penalty demands - after Halkett's challenge replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for the handball - walked away.
The Phenomenon of Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Arena Tony Macaroni
Excellent performance and results for Livingston.
For men, they are very excellent, continuing to exceed expectations on this uplifting trajectory.
Their style of play and staff have hardly changed since returning to the top, but the big credit has to go to Holt for him to launch the team since he came.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was very brave, creating a great regular defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall all over his toes.
Rangers aren't inspired, though.
Good as they were sometimes under Gerrard, they fell away from that standard.
The last ball was somewhat lacking - only once they cut the host team- and it was a call for the Rangers to wake up, who found themselves at the middle table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a wide variety of receptions in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO allies.
They talked about issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's participation in the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have called for security reasons to block 25,000 strong people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many nearby supporters want to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - most of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The defences of the war described the part of a visitor who was praised as a hero by some Turks and fired as an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: Bicycle rider dies in car crash
Bicycle rider died in a violation involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the south-east of the airport, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The incident happened months after another cyclist died in a runaway ditch on Childers Road, about a stone from Saturday's crash.
The Metropolitan Police said the officer was trying to identify the man and inform him of his legacy.
Road closures and bus diversions in places and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riot
Six prison officers were injured in a high-security man's prison, the prison official said.
The disturbance occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at approximately 09:30 BST on Sunday and is ongoing.
"Tornado" experts have been brought in to deal with the disturbance, which involves eight residents and has one wing.
Officers have been treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "The trained prison staff has been assigned to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We don't resist violence in our prisons, and it's clear they are responsible for referring to the police and can spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June he was reported to have received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot officials were called to jail to deal with serious disruptions where staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Heavy Rain (Arid Areas Benefit)
It's rare for tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's probably what happens next week when Hurricane Rosa's wind track crosses the Southwest Desert, a risk of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a route up Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late last night with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten white whales remain tropical storms or depressive status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a typhoon within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicted 2 to 4 inches of rain down, with a remote amount of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas in the Southwest Desert including the Rockies center and the Great Basin may get 1 to 2 inches, with a remote amount up to maybe 4 inches.
For those at risk of flash floods, the Rosa rain may have been merciful since the region was hit by drought.
While flooding is a serious concern, there are those who have been affected by rain since Southwest is now experiencing droughts.
According to the U.S. Census, more than 40 percent of Arizona has the worst drought, the second highest category," reported by weather.com.
First, the Hurricane Rosa route leads to land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, having the power of a Sunday morning typhoon with a maximum wind of 85 miles an hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north by 12 miles an hour.
Storms face cold waters in the Pacific and therefore spawn down.
Thus, it is expected that the land will collapse in Mexico on the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rain throughout parts of Mexico can be severe, leading to the risk of major flooding.
"The amount of rain from Baja California is expected to be northwestern Sonora, so it may be 10 inches," reported by weather.com.
Rosa will track north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then will track through Arizona and south Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main expected danger from Rosa or debris is very heavy rain in Baja California, Sonora northwest, and the U.S. Southwest desert," the National Taufan Center said.
This rain is expected to produce life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in the desert, and land collapses in mountainous areas.
Norton's Midsomer Attack: Four Arrests Attempted to Kill
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found injured in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old man, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset areas, police said.
The officer appealed to those who may have a mobile phone recording of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'painful, meaningless, angry' Democratic Party
"Judge Kavanaugh's vote was to reject a cruel and excessive tactic in the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "very badly, angry" the Democratic Party throughout its candidacy process.
Kavanaugh made a statement before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and vehemently denying the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford she sexually assaulted during the decade of adolescence.
Ford also gave a statement to the hearing about his allegations.
The president said on Saturday "the American people saw the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"One vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds at the moment, a lawman who has a great record in public service," he told the people who support West Virginia.
The president simultaneously referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy when discussing the importance of the Republican election in the general election.
Five more weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives.
I didn't run, but I really ran," he said.
"That's why I'm in a place that fights for a great candidate."
Trump argued that the Democrats were on a mission to "challenge and block."
The first major vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place shortly after Friday, the GOP's right-wing aide-de-camp has told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake, tsunami, with tolls rising
At least 384 people were killed, many swept up by waves of giants crashing on the coast, when an earthquake and a major tsunami hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) hit the ground at dusk, sweeping many deaths and destroying anything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came last night, people were still doing beach activities and not running and eventually they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster capture agency, said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"Tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, rafts, houses, it attacked them all on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before a blow on the shore.
Some people climb trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
Around 16,700 people have been transferred to 24 centers in Paluu.
The aerial images released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, the bridge turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The final squall continued shaking the city on the beach on Saturday.
Several follow-up tremors are felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Research and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the powerful earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more than the atomic bomb energy dropped in Hiroshima in the Second World War.
The city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami wave, the agency said.
Nugroho described the destruction as “expanding” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the building and said another 540 people were injured and 29 others were still missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and destruction may be more devastating along a coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala. It is close to the earthquake center.
"Communications are completely cut off without any information' from the Donggala," Nugroho said.
"About 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers were heading towards the affected area.
"It's a tragedy but it can get even worse," Red Cross said.
The agency was heavily criticized last Saturday for not informing that the tsunami had hit Palu even though officials said the tsunami occurred within a warning period.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man's voice over the building was heard screaming at people on the street about the presence of a tsunami.
Within a few minutes, tsunami waves flooded the beach and drew together buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to confirm the authenticity of the video.
The quake and tsunami resulted in a massive power leak that decided to communicate around Palu and this made it difficult for authorities to carry out search efforts.
The military has sent aid by cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities but the displaced population still needs food and other basic needs, authorities said.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and it will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the transfer center in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 800.
The situation is very bad.
While the World Vision staff from Donggala had survived until in the city of Palu, they passed through the place of disaster. The workers sheltered under tarpal cloths established in the front yard of their office in Palu, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although relief teams began providing disaster relief in a gloomy atmosphere, some said foreign aid workers with deep experience were prevented from heading to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supply of supplies and delivery of workers from abroad can only be carried out if the disaster area is declared a state disaster zone.
That still hasn't happened.
"It is still a disaster at the regional level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia's Red Cross Force.
"When the government says, 'OK, this is a state disaster,' we can just accept help from abroad but for the time being there is no status anymore."
When the second night set in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami last Friday, the friends and family of the missing victims hope that the person they love will be a miracle that emerges and exclaims them of sadness.
On Saturday, a slave was found inside a hanger.
On Sunday, the rescue team rescued the woman who was trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body lying next to her.
Gendon Subandano, Indonesia’s paratrooper team coach, has trained two paratroopers who were missing from the quake for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi said.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how he was seriously sending WhatsApp messages to the launchers in Palu who attended the beach festival after hours of news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the launcher community.
The message sent has only one grey ray sign compared to two blue ray signs.
"I don't think the message came," he said.
The thief stole $26,750 during ATM recharging in Newport on the Levee
The thief stole $26,750 from Brink's worker who filled the money at ATM Newport on the Levee on Friday, according to news released by the Newport Police Department.
The Brink worker vacated the ATM in the entertainment complex and was willing to send more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While Brink's workers are busy performing his duties, a man 'runs to his back' and steals a bag full of money.
Witnesses were seen several suspects fleeing the scene on the basis of the report, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the thieves involved should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rap singer changes his name to Ye
Rap singer Kanye West changed her name - to Ye.
Announcing his change of name on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "This man is officially known as Kanye West."
Kanye West, 41, was named Ye for a while and she used the name of the call as the title of her debut album, which was released in June.
The change took place when she appeared on Saturday Night Live's show where she is expected to release her latest album Yandhi.
"He replaced singer Ariana Grande who canceled her appearance in the show over 'emotional issues,'" the show's creator said.
Previously, Kanye West said the name had a religious meaning and was also an abbreviation for his professional name now.
"I believe 'ye' is a common word often found in the Gospel book and it means 'you,'" Kanye West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you too. I'm also us. We're us.
It turns from Kanye which means only one, to Ye - an image of the return of our good, evil and error and all.
The album is more of a reflection of our own true image."
He was one of the famous rap singers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known by various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
Former Kanye West partner, JAY-Z can also accept it without or with cross marks and capital letters.
Mexico's president, AMLO, has vowed not to use military action against civilians
Mexico's president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to use military action against civilians as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of a bloody tragedy against students.
AMLO promised in Plaza Tlatelolco on Saturday that it "will not occasionally use the military to restrain Mexicans."
The military shot at civilians who held a safe demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, which had caused 300 civilians to die as left-leaning student movements began to take off across Latin America.
AMLO is committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those who are studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to engage in criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its artificial intelligence funds.
"The United States should double the amount of funding in the field of artificial intelligence as China becomes increasingly active in that field," said Kai-Fu Lee, an artificial intelligence investor and practitioner who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The view was expressed after the U.S. government made announcements about artificial intelligence even though the United States itself as a whole lacked an official artificial intelligence strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its platform last year with the goal of becoming number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Increasing the provision of artificial intelligence studies is a good start as all other countries are far behind the United States and we want to achieve our next success in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"By doubling the funds could increase the chances of the next major achievement of artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book 'AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order' was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcout, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most famous companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he attempted an artificial intelligence system that had defeated American Othello players who were in the best position while still studying at Carnegie Mellon University. Later, he became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee recognizes previous U.S. government technology games such as the Robot Challenge from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency and wants to know when the next game will be held so that he can identify new talents.
"Researchers in the United States usually need to work hard to win government aid," Lee said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders but corporate companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have set up great talent from the university to work in artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said a fundamental change in immigration could also help the United States support its artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD graduates in artificial intelligence," he said.
China's state council issued a Future Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
"The Natural Science Foundation of China is providing funding to people in academic institutions. It equates the way the State Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute funds to researchers in the United States but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center aimed at bringing together partners from industry and academia. The White House announced a lineup of Selected Committees for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF also invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that attempts to establish a State Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence is seen to be unenforceable a few months ago.
The people of Macedonia voted to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people carried out a vote on Sunday to determine a name change to the ‘North Macedonia Republic'. An action that will resolve disputes with Greece that have been ongoing for a decade in which Greece has prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Greece, which has its own territory called Macedonia, confirmed that the name ‘Macedonia’ represents demands on its territory and has vetoed the refusal of Macedonia’s participation in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on a name change proposal in June but nationalist opponents said the change undermined Macedonia's ethnic identity, with the majority of its population being Slavic.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the vote and the vote raised doubts as to whether the vote would reach a minimum of 50 percent of the votes needed to make the vote valid.
Question on the ballot: "Do you agree to join NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said "Receiving a new name is a price that is worth paying to join the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I come today to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the European Union because that means our lives are safer," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 in Skopje.
Although it was not legal on the side of the law, lawmakers said they would comply with the vote's decision to make it final.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The country's electoral commission said there were no reports of anything that did not comply with the rules until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was 16 per cent versus 34 per cent in the 2016 parliamentary election after 66 per cent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife and their son Dushko cast ballots in Macedonia for a change of name that will pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the EU in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is setting up a small stage and placing the chairs in front of the tents set up by the people boycotting the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the EU but we want to join it with pride and not through this way," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor people, but we are poor people.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonians, we can turn to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said participation in NATO would provide sufficient investment to Macedonia where its unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
I believe the vast majority will accept it because more than 80 percent of our people vote for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting a vote.
He said the ‘yes’ decision was the ‘confirmation of our future.’
A poll was published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Police Studies, which said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote - below the required amount.
Another poll, run by Macedonian TV Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a vote to be successful, the number of voters to come must be 50 percent plus one vote.
Failure in the vote will be considered the first serious blow to pro-Western government police since taking over in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City navigating through the entire Brighton defensive line to get a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were sent as Brighton's defence in Manchester City and won 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made him look very happy on his net in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a dispatch in the middle of the field at the start of the order.
He raced between three Brighton defences, before cutting into the open field.
Then Aguero finds himself surrounded by four green-dressed players.
He rejected a defense before chasing a few more people on the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he refused to send a message to the left, looking for Sterling.
The English player forward used his first touch inside the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right leg to kill Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with one kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero struggled with his foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored the goal at the time."
But Sterling gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received an inside ball in the Brighton area at the match.
He made a beautiful road ball broadcast through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane took several touches before leading Sterling towards a distant position.
Sky Blues forwards kicking the ball into the net before sliding out of the limit.
City against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group played at 12:55 noon on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play alone against the Rockies
With the Nationals' squad eliminated from the playoffs, there's no reason to force another start.
But the highly competitive Scherzer hopes to face the fort on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a play-off implication for the Rockies, who hold one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies took at least a special spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to lock up their first division champions.
"Even though we're just playing, at least we can know the atmosphere in Denver with the people and other teams going to play as much as possible at the highest level I'm going to face this year.
Why don't I want to fight in it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a start-up for Sunday, but it is reported that it is likely to allow Scherzer to make a comeback in this situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, held a body-warming session on Thursday and will make a comeback on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The bowlers who used the right hand from Washington were 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 hits right in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia
The president by not continuously referring to the situation around the High Court voted Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the interest of the Republican number coming in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will be at risk in November.
Five more weeks to face the most important election in our lives.
I'm not competing but I'm very competitive and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for a great candidate."
Trump added: “You see this terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it’s happening now.
And they are determined to take back power by any means, you see violence, evil.
They do not care who they are ill with, who they need to swallow to gain power and control. What they want is power and control, we will not give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to ‘reject and block.’
“And you saw it four days ago,” he said, calling the Democrats ‘angry, evil and wrong.’
He referred to Senator of the Judiciary Committee the position of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who had received a strong boo from the attendees.
"Do you remember his answer?
You're leaking the document?
Uh, uh, apa.
No, I'm waiting for one - it's a very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen"
Work is no longer a large church.
It's not acceptable for anyone to express their opinions.
When a Momentum activist in my local party voted to denounce me, he didn't hesitate.
After all, I'm the latest in the AP Workline told us that we're not welcome - all because of the voice of our views.
My colleague Joan Ryan received almost the same treatment because he supported anti-Jew.
In my case, the criticism movement has criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In the interests of responsibility about economic policy, about national security, about Europe, whose ironic issue is almost the same as what Jeremy disagrees with the previous leader.
A meeting note for the Nottingham East Labour Party on Friday said that "we want a meeting that is inclusive and productive."
During my nearly eight years as a local Labor AP, the GC meeting on Friday night really covered all of that.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone for many meetings and political promises ‘better, softer’ have long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.
It is becoming more and more apparent that differences of opinion are unacceptable in the Labour party and every opinion will be judged whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as a former co-worker, I thought sharing a nearly identical political view that started expecting me to make a U-round and take a position that I would not agree with - either on national security or the EU single market.
When I speak outside - and no matter what I say - it will be followed by criticism because of abuse on social media, ordered not to vote, denounce the political center, send me out of the Labour party.
And that’s not just my experience.
Yes, I know I'm more fortunate than my co-workers for commenting on me more to politics.
I'm amazed at the professional attitude and persistence of a co-worker who I swear by sexist and barbarism every day but never give up.
One aspect of this era's political disillusionment is how the driving rate has become commonplace.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labour party foster cultural tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer a large church and with every ‘unbelief’ proposal or change in election rules, the party becomes increasingly narrow.
I received a lot of advice from two years ago urging me to sit still, not too prominent and then I would ‘be good.’
But that’s not my goal in the political arena.
Since I joined Work 32 years ago as a school student, raised by Thatcher's government neglect that let my entire grade class collapse, I've been trying to lead better public services for those in great need - whether as a local council member or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East may be mistaken about my position and the conflict with the leadership now.
To those who support the proposal on Friday, what I want to say is that when the country rejects Brexit, it will clear up our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand the feeling of wasting time and energy on my loyalty to Labour party leaders.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my constituents, whether a Labour member or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise unelected grievances or political correctness doesn't stop me from acting in what I believe is in the interests of you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unmatched Ayr climbs to the top
Two slow attempts may make the final decision confusing, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved success in this exciting and entertaining Tennent Premiership match.
They are now at the top of the table, the only one never lost out to 10 people.
Finally, their superior defense, as much as they took chances, made the host team and coach Peter Murchie happy.
"We've been tested for our game so far, and we still can't be beat, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they took a better chance than us."
Grant Anderson made an attempt at the 14th minute, a conversion by Frazier Climo, placing Ayr in front, but, a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, was issued for the match by the Warriors, allowing Melrose to make a net and Jason Baggot caught a non-conversion attempt.
Climo preceded Ayr with a penalty, before, in half-time, he got an eye then a solo conversion attempt to make Ayr 17-5 at rest.
But Melrose started the second period well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, a conversion by Baggot, reduced the gap to five eyes.
There was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was brought out, and from the start, Ayr continued forward again through the trial of Stafford McDowall, a conversion by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson's fiancée was then given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose responded to the extra player with a non-conversion attempt at Bruce Colvine, at the end of a violent time of pressure.
The host team returns, however, and when Struan Hutchinson is given a yellow card due to Climo's unballed tackle, from the penalty line, MacPherson bounces behind the forward hit Ayr.
Climo's conversion, as he did almost the same as the start, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent away flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth try of the host team.
Still Game stars are seen ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran is seen as ready to move into the hospitality industry after he was named director for the licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old starred as Jack Jarvis in the BBC's famous show, where he co-wrote and starred alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth series is the last in the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning a lifetime after Craiglang.
According to the official record report, he is the director for Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although Scottish Sun sources speculated that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "advanced restaurant business."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The Navy's naval headquarters in La Paz.
The building has a blue sea flag.
The naval base from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon was propelled by a motto: 'The sea is our real property.
It's a responsibility to get it back."
Throughout Bolivia surrounded by land, the memory of the loss of beaches to Chile in bloody conflicts in the 19th century is still evident - as a desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is perhaps the highest in this century, as Bolivia is still awaiting a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and calmness, and of course we are looking forward to a positive decision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will side with Bolivia's demands - after centuries of discussion - Chile is required to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president - who faces controversial opposition to next year's re-election - also has a lot of interest in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not make a biased decision to Bolivia - and if it does happen a little bit it will change very much.
The U.N. body based in the Netherlands has no authority to award the area to Chile, and has determined that it will not determine the decision for a possible discussion.
The ICJ's decision, which will come out only after six months of final arguments, was heard to indicate the case was "not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, Chile's international legal expert.
And not to slow down Bolivia’s policy again, during these four years there may be obstacles.
"Jesus to the entrance to the sea has been robbed by the Bolivian administration now," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' rhetorical hostility has reduced Chile's compassion a little, he suggests.
Bolivia and Chile will at one time continue to talk, but it will be too difficult to hold a discussion afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was usually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end the 139-year truce for the common good," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the famous presidents in Latin America - used maritime issues as political aid.
"Bolivia has never given up on its right to a direct route to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"This decision is an opportunity to see that we need to forget the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons violations won't happen unless it trusts the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not commit their nuclear weapons crimes first if it did not trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during the Singapore summit between rival leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to want to restart nuclear diplomacy that stalled more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was “just a dream” that continued restrictions and U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War would cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington is wary of agreeing to a declaration without Pyongyang first making an important act of gun violence.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is as serious about launching weapons that are seen as the only way to guarantee its country's security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month for Kim-Trump's second summit.
The Paris Fashion Show introduces the latest design of a large head ornament on its way to the main street near you.
If you want to add a collection of your hats or completely block the sunlight, then you don't have to look far.
Detectives Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a variety of large-sized bizarre head ornaments for their SS19 collection on the festive stage featuring a style set on Paris Fashion Week.
The impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and this designer has sent their designs that fit into the entertainment stage.
The design that Valentino stands out for is a great water yellow hat decorated with a thick imitation fur that covers the model's head.
Other large-sized accessories include a decorated jewel, smart hat and even a nanny - but it's not designed to make your head hot.
Thom Browne also revealed a choice of strange masks - and the right time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have been sewn on his lips and more resemble Hannibal Lecter than decent fashion.
One design resembles scuba diving equipment equipped with snorkels and gogals, while the other one looks like a liquid ice cream cone.
And if you keep on with the big fashion reality - you're lucky.
A style observer predicts that a very large bonnet may be heading to the main road near you.
The large-sized hat is warmer than 'La Bomba', a two-foot-wide straw hat has been seen worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The king of labels behind the very impractical hat has been posted on social media sending another big design to the parade stage - straw beach bags are almost as big as the model covering the bathing suit he wears.
The ivory-colored rafia bag burned, decorated with rafia stained and added to the white holder, which stands out in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity style expert Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to be able to see a large cap and beach bags arrive on the main road for the summer to come - because designers have made a huge and difficult impact to let the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are very important for global citizens
Scotland's private schools maintain a record of achievement for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with yet another set of excellent test decisions, reinforced by individuals and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school, represented by the Scottish Private Schools Institute (SCIS), strives to provide services at the best level to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students to continue higher learning, their choice career, and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that they can and implement an earlier school curriculum, we see the continually popular modern language and subject of yamg choice desired within the school.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it will go into his head.
If you speak to him in his mother’s language, he will enter into his heart.”
This is a strong warning that we should not only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's exam results, we can see that language is the top subject in the league schedule with the highest graduation rate in private schools.
A total of 68% of students who learn a foreign language get a higher A grade.
This data, collected from 74 SCIS school members, showed 72 percent of students received a higher A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of them studied German, 69 percent of them learned French and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also received A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will no longer be in need of in the future.
Language now, as the subject of choice, is being held the same as the subject of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that employers struggled to meet the vacancy, with 17 percent attributed to language skills shortages.
That's why, over and over again, language skills become a must to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring language, these skills are crucial in this global world.
Regardless of a person's choice career, if they learn a second language, they will have real advantages in the future by having lifelong skills like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from a foreign country will put someone who controls many languages automatically in front of the competition.
According to the YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 percent were not allowed to speak in a foreign language good enough for conversation, with French as the language of conversation being used only by two-digit percent, 15 percent.
This is why investing in today's language teaching is important for children today.
Having a wide range of languages, especially countries that are developing their economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the language they learn.
The school will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are seen as essential for the UK when looking ahead in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there are often many languages to choose from within private schools, with the power of an expert teacher in that section.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing an atmosphere of learning that will prepare children and provide them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It is undeniable at this time, in a global business environment, that language continues to be very important to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern language should be regarded as a ‘skill of international communication.’
Private schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Private Schools Council
LeBron will make the Lakers' first appearance on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game before the season on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play is yet to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell has revealed that James will be playing in a limited time.
Following early practice this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule before the Lakers season.
"I don't need a game before the season to prepare for this stage of my career," he said.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has launched an emergency rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was Trump's first of five scheduled meetings next week, including stopping at a friendly venue including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote held for him elected to fill the vacancy in the Federal Court, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is decided in November.
How many Trump meetings in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump's rally at Wheeling in West Virginia is scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to deal with this week's trial for Federal Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with confirmation of the Senate vote expected to be held for a week during an FBI investigation.
But the main goal of this urgent assembly is to help Republicans gain momentum in the face of the November election.
So, President Trump's campaign said the five meetings next week were "strengthening volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and develop the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so critical of his agenda that the president will go to as many countries in our country as possible towards a busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's gathering could bring back supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and pull coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a country he won more than 40 percent of his eyeballs in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is rooting for him in the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey so the president needs to come to support him," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. forces show courage to fight in ensuring there is still hope for a solo match on Sunday
After three heavy side matches, the corner match on Saturday evening was probably what the Ryder Cup needed this time.
Momentum swing is a sports concept that is a creation but it is really trusted by players, and even more so in games like this.
So where's the momentum now?
"They have an advantage of six eyes and now it's four eyes, so we brought a little momentum, I think," Jordan Spieth said as he walked at the end of the day.
Europe already has an advantage, four eyes ahead with twelve more eyes to pick up.
American players, as Spieth says, feel they have little advantage and a sense of encouraged, not just from Spieth and Justin Thomas who play together throughout the day and each have three out of four eyes.
Spieth showcases a viable game from start to green area and is an example to other players.
The lively chorus grew stronger as he continued to sneeze, making an important knock to match the four eyes when he and Thomas were missing after two eyes.
His archer who gave them victory on the 15th hole was greeted with the same cheer, which tells you that he believes the American troops are still fighting.
"You just have to try harder and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That’s all there is for all these players now.
18 holes to show power.
Only two players with more eyes than Spieth and Thomas since two days ago were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a story in the undisputed Ryder Cup.
The pair of players are different characters that are interesting from this Europe but prefer four eyes out of four and don't seem to make any mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't do bogs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogs on Saturday morning, Friday evening and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The period and the way their energy is given and shown by supporters is evidence that they are players to be killed on Sunday, and no player is more popular to restrict the possibility of European victory during sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's best if they're both in a different hole.
However, the conversation about the victory of the European troops was too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson facilitated the work of Sergio Garcia, the hero of four players this morning, when he was compared to Alex Noren.
One bog and two doubles in the first nine holes formed the Spanish player and the Swedish player.
However, on Sundays, no one can help you.
Four balls and four players are very interesting to watch more closely because of the interaction between the pair, the advice given and not given and the strategies that can change in a blink of an eye.
Europe played better as a team so far and advanced far on the last day but this fourth session also showed the U.S. Army had the courage that was previously advocated by many parties, including local fans.
European teams advance 10-6 to the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe brought a comfortable advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after rising from a four-ball and four-player game with 10-6 points over the United States.
Both great players, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari advanced with two wins over Tiger Woods who were struggling to bring their victory at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team led by Thomas Bjorn attempted to maintain the stolen trophy at Hazeltine two years ago, mastering a full-fledged American team at a four-ball morning session, with a 3-1 series eye.
The U.S. team provided more competition in a four-player game, winning two matches, but could not tie a gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed 8 out of 12 points in Sunday's solo match to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European player to win four consecutive points during his and Molinari, named "Molliwood" after a thrilling weekend is the second pair to win four of their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then together defeated Woods and the new American player, Bryson Dechambeau in a 5–4 game.
Woods, who went through two tough matches on Saturday, showed brilliance but has now lost in 19 of 29 four-ball and four-player matches and seven consecutively.
Justin Rose, who did not play a break during a four-ball morning session, again clashed with Henrik Stenson in a four-player match to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2&1 - ranking one and three in the world.
Europe is not lucky on a quiet and relaxing day in the southwest of Paris.
The three-time major championship winner, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas became the yardstick for America with two eyes on Saturday.
They earned a 2&1 win killing Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in a four-ball match and then again killing Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a 4&3 match in a four-player game that killed on two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a four-eyed team headed into the singles match, even as the defending champion of the Furyk team only needs a series to maintain the trophy.
After occupying second place for two days, the attacks on Sunday seemed beyond their reach.
North Korea says it's 'impossible' they will voluntarily disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued restrictions had caused a deep distrust of the United States and it was unlikely that his country would voluntarily release nuclear weapons in the situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "an important miracle step" last year, such as halting nuclear tests and guided bullets, shutting down nuclear testing sites and pledged not to expand the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there would be no confidence in the security of our country and in such a situation, it would not be possible for us to abandon the weapon in a difficult way first."
While Ri has voiced complaints against North Korea about Washington's opposition to a "gradual" approach to nuclear disarmament in which North Korea will be rewarded for taking steps in reverse, the reality seems important because it does not reject the voluntary rejection as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to seek for "nuclear surveillance of the Korean peninsula" while Trump provided assurances to North Korea's security.
North Korea sought an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said that Pyongyang should release its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also refused to follow the measures to loosen international restrictions on North Korea.
"The U.S. reaffirms its "pre-observation" and increases the level of pressure in the restrictions to achieve their goals by force, and even opposes the "final declaration of war," Ri said.
"The perception that restrictions can weaken us is an empty dream of those who don't recognize us.
But the problem is a continuous restriction that is increasingly worsening our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader brokered during a United Nations conference earlier this week.
The minister called only three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Kim Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the party in this termination issue is South Korea and not the U.S., the nuclear termination from the Korean peninsula will not find a ceasefire."
However, Ri's tone of voice was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korean rockets could not be avoided after Trump's "Mr. Evil President" named Kim a rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at a United Nations conference, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to denuclearize, but said a lot of work still needs to be done and restrictions need to remain in place until North Korea ends its nuclear program.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with earnest and without fail so that we feel a complete, final and confirmed nuclear termination."
The Security Council has voiced an increase in restrictions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to dismantle the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go smoothly.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea in a few hours after that had condemned him for making "a demand like a gangster."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to reveal the site of a guided missile and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate steps."
He said Kim had told him that the "same steps" Kim was looking for were security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore and headed toward normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students have taken courses to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year has given all of its students more sleep in an effort to fight the ever-increasing learning culture through caffeine-based 'all night'.
A teaching power found students at the world's number one university often couldn't understand the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, provided a course he believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to begin the course after giving a lecture on the effects of lack of sleep during learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I only told about this now, in my senior year?’
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - and that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This course was introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students about the need for good sleep habits to help academic and sports performance, as well as improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding its students lack sleep throughout the week.
The one-hour course involves some interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of the dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, snacks, coaches and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep routines.
In other parts, participants were told how a lack of long-term sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Campus maps with interactive icons, then encourage participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it won't change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects when choosing to smoke," added Prof. Czeisler.
A culture of pride in ‘watching all night long’ still exists, he said, while adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Making sure you have enough sleep quality, it should be a student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain into a mode of hunger, making it always hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after taking his class last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to develop the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete the same study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler suggests that students should consider the use of alarm clocks before and also after bedtime, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can damage your circadian rhythm from moving, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal kills Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another defeat in the match when Dolly Menga's net tied weak team Steven Gerrard with a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
The Ibrox team is still looking for the first win in the match since the February 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager to cause his team to miss eight points behind the league's Ladbrokes Premiership predecessor, Hearts.
The manga exploded in the seventh minute before the first half and the Rangers seemed to have no idea to equalize the position.
With the Rangers now down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third and was just behind Hibernian with a goal difference.
And Rangers may face problems again after the line-up, Calum Spence is forced to be treated for a head injury after facing objects from his army area.
Gerrard made eight exchanges on his side that led to the semi-final of the Betfred Cup after defeating Ayr.
Holt also kept the same team as Livi 11 who stole one eye from Hearts last week and he was certainly happy with the way his team played which frightened their opponents at all times.
Rangers may have mastered the game but Livingston made more attempts at goals.
They were supposed to score only two minutes after Menga's first touch gave Scott Pittman space through Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder was intercepted.
A free kick from Keaghan Jacobs' back encounters captain Craig Halkett but his defenceman Alan Lithgow can only send the ball behind the goal.
The Rangers managed to regain control but he remained only hopeful in the last thirty minutes.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been given a penalty kick in the forty-five minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided but the referee Steven Thomson allowed the Colombian player to withdraw.
Rangers managed to give just two tries in the first half but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily knocked out Lassana Coulibaly's pitch and the weak Ovie Ejaria's.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be contrary to the game's punctuation, no one can deny their chances.
The Rangers once again failed to cope with Jacobs' planned move.
Scott Arfield was only stiff when Declan Gallagher drew the ball to Scott Robinson who calmly sent it to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard made an exchange during the break time by exchanging Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and he almost gave an immediate impression when the winger gave the ball to Morelos but the amazing Kelly came out of his area to block.
But Livingston continues to train opposing teams to play the games they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sending out a far-reaching message for a far-off broadcast.
Holt's forces were supposed to widen the gap in the final rounds but McGregor held out well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow's shot was scored from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton appealed another penalty kick as he clashed with Jacobs but again Thomson didn't mind.
Almanac: Creator of Geiger
And now, the page from our Almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and IMPORTANT... the day on which physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger created a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger Pengira.
As the main basis of science since then, Kaunter Geiger became the backbone of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring unknown scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man: "What is it?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's Radiator, used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear this earphone, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms given by the radioactivity in the mineral."
"Yeah, that sounds like it now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the creation that bears his name remains forever.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to 'see' bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' the evil cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment.
The method involved is to extract the immune cells from the patient, change them in the laboratory.
It can "see" a common protein that occurs in many cancer cells and is then injected again.
The trial vaccine shows a decision that is favorable to patients with various types of cancer.
A woman is treated with a vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, recovers from her ovarian cancer after more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the proteins that are common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our test results show that we have a very good vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explains Prof Berzofsky.
The same approach to taking immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has been successful in treating types of leukemia.
Kanye West attended the Pro-Trump poll, wearing a MAGA hat, after his SNL appearance.
It is not well accepted.
Kanye West was teased in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a great performance in which she praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said she would compete in 2020.
After bringing his third song that night titled Ghost Town where he was wearing a ‘Make America Great’ cap, he continued to oppose the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I asked white people and they said, 'How can you support Trump, he's a racist?'"
That's how, if I'm worried about civilization, I've moved out of America long ago," he said.
The SNL began a performance with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star saw the recognition of Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, Kanye West's footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
Not sure if Rock was trying to trick West with the shipment.
Also, West has complained to the audience that he has had difficulty behind the scenes about his hat.
"They hit me at the back of the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat.'
They're staring at me!
Then they said, "I'm in an unimportant place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added: "You want to see that irrelevant position?" by saying that he would "wear my Superman coat, because this means you can't lead me. You want the world moving forward?
Try to love."
His comments invited a mock-up at least twice from the audience and the SNL actors seemed ashamed, Variety reported, with one there telling the publication: "The whole studio was silent."
West has been brought in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, where her former boyfriend, singer Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed as a Perrier Bottle.
West received the support of the chairman of TPUSA's conservative group, Candace Turner, who sent a statement: "To one of the bravest people: THE TERMS OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF Criticism."
But a quip from the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter said West was just "being himself and that's great."
"But I choose not to give a reward to someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') whom I believe to accept and share an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
"We too," he added.
Before the performance, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was now known as "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, a rap singer, Snoop Dogg once changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course his song refers to the music of the legend, Prince, which changed his name to a symbol and later also as an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in stabbing incident at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star, Kit Harington tackles toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress has voiced the maco hero stereotype, calling her character played on screen meaning young people often feel like they need to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed "there's something wrong" and questioned how to deal with toxic masculinity issues in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who is recently married to Games of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, admits she feels "very strong" about dealing with the issue.
'I think it's pretty strong in person, at the moment - where are we wrong with masculinity?' he said.
"What did we teach men when they were growing up, from the point of view of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes television may be responsible for an increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine features.
He added: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes boys feel like they need to be this guy?
I think that’s one of the important questions at the moment – how do we change it?
"There's obviously something wrong with young people right now."
In the interview, he also admitted he would not play any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series ends next summer, saying he was "finished with the battlefield and the horses."
In November, Kit will star in a remake of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, a pirate.
The actor recently revealed that he considered a meeting with his wife, Rose, to be the best thing that ever happened in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this project, so that's how it gave me a future family and my life started here," he said.
Rose brings Ygritte's character, the love of Jon Snow played by Kit, in a fantasy series that won the Emmy award.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, health officials said.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases are infected through sex, indicating a change from the previous one.
Usually, HIV spreads rapidly through several parts of China as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
But the number of people with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a hearing in the Yunnan region.
However, year after year, the number of HIV and AIDS sufferers in China has increased by 100,000.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality is no longer a crime in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be more and more prevalent.
Because of the conservative values of the country, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Most of the spread of the disease is due to insufficient sexual protection in the relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies her staff leaking GOP senator's data, inciting 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the allegations of a staff member who had exposed the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the law-enforcement Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat confirmed the claims had been circulated by "ultra-right wing" members and websites.
"Fraud, fraud and more serious fraud," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
This information is reported to include home address and phone number for U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, broadcast by an unidentified man in Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators called for Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported an IP address identifying the source of the shipment associated with Waters officials and disseminating information from Waters staff members, Hill said.
"These unfounded accusations are false and one lie," Waters said again.
"My staff - where his identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised because of these false allegations - are at all unrelated to the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and is a form of deception."
Waters's statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This confession is of an angry nature," wrote Fleischer.
"It shows he doesn't have the characteristics of being a Congressman.
When someone is accused of doing something they don't do, they can't be angry.
They can't resist.
They can't question the motive of the defendant.
They have to be calm."
Fleischer said during a comparison of Waters' reaction and Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics who appeared too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is contesting to kill Waters in the midterm elections, also voiced his opinion on Twitter.
"It's great news if it's true," he whispered.
In fact, Waters said its official had informed "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about this false accusation.
"We will ensure the perpetrators will be exposed," he said, "and they will be responsible for all their actions that could destroy and be dangerous to any and all of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again: The Fraud of the Weak Rowan Atkinson
It is common now to look for signs of Brexit in any new film with a British slang and it seems to be applicable to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny Engilsh and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there a joke about how bad we are becoming the new export opportunities of the country?
Anyway, Johnny English who likes to blink and face tired has a chance to ruin the situation for the second time - the name of the signal is more than anything that he is a wide comic creation designed for the non-English-language movie audience.
He was, of course, a silly secret agent who dared to dismiss the glamorous character of Clouseau, a little Mr Bean and a musician who contributed one note to the theme song Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He was also inspired by the mysterious international adventurer and private agent, Rowan Atkinson who once appeared in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercial, leaving the chaos behind.
There's one or two great moments in JE's latest film.
I like Johnny English approaching the helicopter while wearing medieval war clothes and fan blades attached to his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is on air, but his jokes are very weak and strange, especially "serious" films such as 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently offer comedy as their material.
The joke felt as if it was being played out for children versus adults, and to me Johnny English's unintentional mistake was not innovating and focusing on Atkinson's films in the persona Bean.
The main premise is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-attacker has infiltrated Britain's web secret network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the field and disappointing the agent in charge - a very small character for Kevin Eldon.
It was the last chance for a proud and struggling prime minister with political and unpopular breakdowns: Emma Thompson gave her best with this side character Teresa May but nothing good in the script for her character.
His intelligence advisor tells him every active psychic has been compromised, and he needs to call someone out of retirement.
And that means Johnny English himself, who is lazy and now works as a school teacher in some fancy places, but gives a lesson that's not appropriate to being a secret agent: some good jokes here, because English offers a science of divination at an academy like the School of Rock.
English was taken back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former assistant Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a cobbled-up character brought on by a rather damaging Vicki Pepperdine.
So, Batman and Robin, who are embroiled in the Secret Service of Her Majesty's Highness, are back in action in the face of the beautiful female predator Ophelia Bulletova by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being impacted by the charismatic technology millionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta and played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventure with a small task: disguised as a servant, lit fire and burned French restaurants; diligently sneaking into the luxury cruise ship of Volta; and English sparks fury when she tries to use Maya's headphone to familiarize herself inside the house of Volta.
All the funny scenes are well-bred for the final round, but due to the fact that it looks friendly and slender there's a little bit of a taste like a children's television show about it.
It's a pretty simple film.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I'm starting to think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a character that really matches his talent?
The Nafi Labour Party plans for the British people to work four days a week but is paid for five days
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn considered a radical plan that would see British citizens work four days a week - but paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants the company's bosses to channel savings made through artificial intelligence (AI) revolutions to workers by giving them an extra day off.
He would watch the staff enjoy the weekend for three days - but still bring home the same salary.
The source said the idea was "appropriate" to the party's economic agenda and plans to bring the country to the workers.
Moving to work for four days a week is supported by the Labor Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic change.
A right-wing Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "Basic studies are expected to be announced before the end of this year.
"It won't happen overnight but working for four days a week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy and favoring workers as well as the entire party's industrial strategy."
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week in the 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not the party's policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labor trial last week by advancing his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize power from the "faceless director" and the "prosecutor" in the utility firm.
The shadow chancellor's plan also meant that current shareholders in the water company may not be able to recover their entire shares because the Labour government could make a "cut" on the grounds that they were considered to be making a mistake.
He also approved plans to put employees in the company's board of directors and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund to hand over 10 percent of the equity of private sector firms to employees, who will receive an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could affect Republican senators to provide their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could find something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seems more open than his friend from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I told him to come to the trial, I said, I've been talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this, which the charge came up, and said, 'Will you do it?'
He's firm, steady, clear."
In any case, Graham's vote has already been determined.
"I've already made the decision to tent Brett Kavanaugh and he will take a heavy charge," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know about this: Brett persistently denies it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people he named couldn't confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any change."
Is the World People's Party and Has the Event Done Something to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World People's Party, an annual music event that features a series of stunning stars and its equally great mission; ending world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World People's Party will see tens of thousands of people gather in Central Park's Great Site to not only watch performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's real goals ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World People's Day, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international support group aimed at eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively opposed to it.
To receive this event's free tickets (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors to the concert need to prepare for some tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, making phone calls or any other means to help raise awareness of their poverty eradication goals.
However, how far is the success of the World People with the remaining 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of giving a free concert an honest way to persuade people to demand something action, or just another case of "clickivism" - making someone feel they've done something by signing just one online petition or by sending a receipt?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says they have recorded as many as 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who urge movement with different goals.
They say these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will bring change to more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
By early 2018, the group had identified 390 commitments and announcements that stemmed from their actions, and at least $10 billion of them had already been allocated or had been collected.
The group also estimates that the funds it has known have had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Several key committees including the Food Power, a partnership between UK-based investors and enforcement agencies committed to "helping children fully tap their potential", promise to donate $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate unbalanced nutrition in the neighbourhood after receiving more than 4,700 Go ciabals from the government.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, federal government and Global Citizens like you, we can make this unbalanced social food injustice a landmark story in history," said Food Power Ambassador Tracey Ullman at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said after receiving more than 5,000 calls for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has pledged to fund a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will now reach 5 million women and children who need it.
Responding to one of the common questions on his website that asked "what makes you think we can end severe poverty?"
Global Citizen has responded: "This is a difficult path and it will take time - sometimes we will be disappointed and despaired.
But, just as the movement has demanded public rights and anti-apartheid before, we will succeed, because when we work together we will grow stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e were among several artists who co-hosted the show this year in New York, which will be hosted by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a "block" to prevent Russia from exporting oil - Home Secretary
Washington could "if necessary" use its Navy to stop Russia from selling its oil on the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, according to a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke claimed Russia's withdrawal from Syria - as is known, involving themselves at the invitation of the Syrian government - is said to be looking for a new oil market.
"I believe their presence in the Middle East is to dominate the oil supply as they have done in Eastern Europe and southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there is a way to address this issue.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to prevent them from being marketed," he said.
Zinke said so when making a speech at an encouraging Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group broadcasting itself as an "oil user voice" in the US.
He also compared Washington's actions against Russia and Iran, and stressed the same.
"The economic choice over Iran and Russia is much less the same, affecting and replacing oil," he said, while referring to Russia as having no other choice and with its oil-dependent economy.
The statement was issued when the Trump administration on a mission to increase the export of liquid natural gas to Europe that is much cheaper to consumers in Europe, replacing Russia.
For that reason, Trump officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "heavy-side" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said would make Berlin supported by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project will include existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters and it is just an economic project.
The Kremlin is pushing Washington so hard to refute this project is because of the economy and is an example of unfair competition.
"I am sure we agree that the supply of energy should not be a weapon to suppress and users should be free to vote," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. action has called for Germany's dissatisfaction, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organization in Germany, the German Industrial Union (BDI), has called for the US not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and also on the agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when there is a third country involved in our country's energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the German Industrial Union (BDI) recently after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will "Think Cooking" to Compete as President in 2020, Massachusetts Senators said.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would "think cooking" before becoming a candidate for president following the midterm elections.
When the question of open answers with residents in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said he would consider competing.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government and this includes putting a woman on top of her," she said.
"After November 6th, I will think with his cooking to become a presidential candidate."
Warren expressed his concern about President Donald Trump when it came to open answers, saying that Trump "is driving our country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren strongly criticized Trump for running for Brett Kavanaugh as a candidate for the Federal Court.
In a statement on Friday, Warren said "we definitely need an FBI investigation before the draw is made."
However, a survey on Thursday showed the majority of residents in the area represented by Warren felt Warren was not eligible to compete in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not contest, according to a survey by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Studies Center.
Thirty-two percent support him in the fight.
The survey also showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to compete, with 38 percent supporting him potentially to compete and 48 percent disagreeing.
The name of another high-profile Democrat who was also discussed as potentially competing in 2020 is former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide it by January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin Discusses Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Track Palin at Trump's Meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son faces, after he gets home, I can feel the feelings of other families facing this PTSD problem and those coming home with injuries," he said at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his son's detention was "significant" and he said of his son and other war veterans as, "they came home differently, somewhat harsh and wondered if they would be pardoned for their sacrifice to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with reports of domestic violence and possessing weapons when drunk, according to Dan Bennet, a Wasilla Police Department spokesman.
18 states, Washington supports a move towards a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support to oppose a U.S. policy that prevents asylum-seekers from fleeing terrorist attacks or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and territories made a friend's registration to the court on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who opposed the policy, NBC news reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Shaman case created by the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her husband and "her son's violent group members" had harassed her but U.S. officials had refused her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors in favor of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which has the most people applying for asylum in the U.S., as a country filled with problems of evil groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum application policy returned a decision made in 2014 in which the Immigration Appeals Board had allowed immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney for Columbia, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "does not transfer state, federal and international laws that have existed decades ago."
"The federal law requires all applications for asylum to be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances that led to the application, and prevents it from violating the principle," a friend told the court.
Prosecutors also disputed the policy, which prevented immigrants from entering the U.S. economy from deteriorating, saying it was likely that they would become entrepreneurs and "become the necessary workforce."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered the immigration judge to stop providing asylum to the fugitive victims for domestic violence crimes and for the violence of the evil group in June.
"It will be given to those who leave their homeland for fear of being oppressed because of racism, religion, corruption or because of belonging to a particular social group or clinging to different policies," Sessions said when announcing the policy on June 11.
The goal is not to solve all the problems -- even though all the problems are serious -- that everyone in the world faces every day.
Work saves more and more ranks in Palu while the death toll doubles
For those who survived, the situation is more acute.
"It's a very stressful feeling," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who was mourning her baby boy who was feverish in the bustling city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance carries a corpse.
There's very little drinking water."
Residents seem to be on their way home to their homes that have been ransacked, searching for their items in the water while trying to save as much as possible.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospital was damaged by an earthquake at a magnitude 7.5 that was too terrible.
Among those injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outside as a result of a subsequent earthquake.
His tears flowed as he swam back as the earthquake hit a five-star hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There's nothing to save us.
I'm stuck on a collapsed wall, it feels like it," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city to attend a wedding ceremony.
"I heard my wife's voice asking for help, then kept quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and son.
I hope they're safe.
U.S. envoy accuses China of 'propaganda'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the U.S. newspaper detailing the common good of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused China of using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register - the highest-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the congressional elections on November 6, an accusation that China denied.
Trump's allegations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election explain what U.S. officials reported to Reuters as a new phase in a campaign to pressure the Chinese state.
As usual practice for a foreign government to broadcast advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now reeling in a worsening trade war with each imposing tariffs on their imports.
China's initial action in this trade war is to target exporters in a country like Iowa who support the Republican Party represented by Trump, Chinese and U.S. state experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, the largest exporter of agricultural goods to China, said the Beijing move had made it difficult for many American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a press room in the Des Moines Register on Sunday wrote, "now it's more baffling by broadcasting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In broadcasting this propaganda, the Chinese government has accepted the freedoms practiced by America, a tradition that prioritizes freedom of speech and freedom of the press," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the newspaper in Beijing, there is very little dissent and you can't see the real public's view of the Chinese state's worrying economic direction because their media is under strict control by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the major newspapers in China has avoided the offer to publish" his article, although he did not state which one.
Women's suffrage campaigning for midterm elections due to Kavanaugh's story.
Although many prominent Republicans backed and sided with Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate of the Federal Court who faces allegations of sexual harassment, analysts warned they would invite responses specifically from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The high emotion covered this story and most Republicans stated in their record they would continue with the vote.
Those things can't be changed," said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell Study Center, Syracuse University in an article published Saturday in The Hill newspaper.
Reeher is unsure of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s move to force the FBI to begin an investigation is enough to silence angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened last night - they will not forget it tomorrow and also in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" while pointing to feelings in the Senate building's precinct when the Republican ruling Justice Committee voted to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
"Democratic excitement and motivation will explode," Stu Rothenberg, a free political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's too high; it's true.
This may be higher especially for women voters who will vote from the suburbs and young voters, 18-29 years old, they do not like the president and rarely vote.
Prior to Ford's public testimony detailing allegations of sexual assault against him by the prospective Federal Court, analysts thought would be valid if the Republican side continued with the confirmation.
"This has been something very complicated for the GOP," said Micheal Steela, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC news.
"It's not just a committee vote or a final vote or if Kavanaugh succeeds in becoming a federal judge, it's also about how the Republicans handle this issue and how they serve him," said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helped elect Democrats to the newscast.
However, the American people seem to be divided into two and don't know to trust who in Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony with more than half side to Ford.
A recent YouGov survey showed 41 percent said they would believe or might believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they believed or might believe Kavanaugh.
Meanwhile, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh might or certainly be lying in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pressured by Flake, the FBI is now investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other charge, reports Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian newspaper.
Last week Ford made a sworn confession in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh advised him in a drunken state when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez also said the Federal Court's candidacy also showed his disgust at Ford when a party was demanding him at Yale University around the 1980s.
The creator of the world's website is planning to launch a new Internet network to replicate Google and Facebook.
The creator of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, launched a startup to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that uses open source software based on Berners-Lee's solid creation.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be entitled to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's real goal was "to take over the world."
"We need to do this now," he said of the start-up company.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can include a contact list, daily work list, calendar, song list and other personal professional accessories.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify that are available in one browser and simultaneously.
What's unique about the storage of data in this personal chat is that it's up to the user for who can access the type of information needed.
The company has described it as "personal control through data."
The key to this Inrupt, according to its Chief Executive Officer John Bruce, is to bring certain resources, processes and expertise to help people enjoy Solid.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several construction staff contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer code writers.
Starting this week, tech developers from all over the world can create their own free apps without focusing on any location using the features found in the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team had no discussions with "Facebook and Google to introduce or not introduce a change where all their business models will change immediately.
“We don’t ask for their truth.”
In an issue in Medium on Saturday, Bernes-Lee wrote, Inrupt, "its mission is to provide a single business force and ecosystem to help protect the intergrity and quality of new websites built using Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet world when he founded the World Web Site Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been discussing the need for websites to be free.
While launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Web Site Consortium, Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the new era of the website," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: First World War Victoria Cross Recipient's Padres Celebrated
The only priest from the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross award during the First World War as a combat soldier has been celebrated in the village after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Paderi Benard Vann who received this award on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by snipers four days later and did not immediately know he had ever known that he had been awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone has been erected and opened by his two grandchildren in a march in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a "symbolism" because the stone would open a curtain 100 years after his grandfather's brave action.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vann carried his battalion across the Strait of Saint-Quentin "which was filled with thick fog and averted a great raid of cannons."
His driving he wandered to the border and with "extraordinary courage" and led him before rolling using a single gun and shooting three people.
Lieutenant Colonel was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a month before the war ended.
Micheal Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "something I couldn't possibly repeat and was so demanding."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also put a bouquet of flowers after the ceremony, led by the Brentwood Imperial Fair.
Micheal Vann said it was "very honored to be part of this movement" and added "true courage with the support given by so many people."
MMA fans watch all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they are given Peppa Pig
Try to imagine, you've been up all night watching Bellator 206 but disappointed by watching the main performance.
A list of San Jose's 13 matches, including six major matches that will air live each night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to clash, audiences in the UK were stunned when the broadcast switched to the Peppa Pig show.
Some of them are angry because they watch all night to watch this match.
One fan said the exchange to a children's cartoon channel was "a non-smooth joke" through his makeup.
"The government regulations show the broadcast at 6 a.m. is inappropriate for the match so they are forced to broadcast for children," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa is Khinzir," he said.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they were trying to reschedule the broadcast so that viewers in the UK could watch it.
"I think, when I talk about recasting, I think we can do something," Coker said.
“But at six o’clock on Sunday we can’t do anything until Sunday is our time, that is Monday is their time.
We're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast is switched on, there are a lot of retransmissions of alt text and not everything is nice to hear.
We're trying to solve this problem, we think it's a technical problem.
But no, it's more of an issue with the government.
I promise this won't happen in the future.
We're going to limit it to five games instead of six - as usual - and we're trying to do something that can't be done for fans.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "low self-esteem" towards sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up with low self-esteem because of his sexuality - but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old didn't realize anything until he went to high school and felt "not everyone like me."
Speaking for the first time on the Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, she spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also spoke after his father's title, he didn't mean so much about winning the Olympics.
The broadcaster remains in the long-awaited plan, Kris Young has been on vacation for several months due to illness.
His sudden appearance in Laverne's first draft, Daley said he felt "less than" his peers when growing up because "he was not socially accepted as a man or a woman."
He said: "To this day, feelings less than others and feelings different than others are things that have pushed me and given me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something" he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic medallist is now a high-profile campaigner for the LBGT and has used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year so that more countries no longer make homosexuality a crime.
He said he said this because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any problems and wanted to give "hope" to others like him.
The three-time world champion said the event fell in love with a man - the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "unexpectedly direct."
Daley married the Oscar winner who was 20 years older than himself last year but said their age gap was never an issue.
"When you go through so much experience at such a young age" - he joined the first Olympic sport when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone in this age-link who was going through the same challenge.
The couple became a father in June to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said "all the prescients" of his life have now changed.
"If you ask me last year, it's just about 'I need to win the gold medal'," he said.
"There's actually something more than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son's name is derived from his father, Robert, who died in 2011 when he was 40 years old after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't want to accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether their ticket to London 2012 had already been purchased - because he wanted to sit in front of it once.
“I didn’t have the heart to say ‘I probably wouldn’t have been there to sit in the front row’,” he said.
"I was still holding my father's hand when he stopped breathing and not until my father stopped breathing and had just passed away I realized that my father would not live forever," he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I realize this is what I've been dreaming of all my life - to jump in front of my fans in my own country at the Olympics, there's no other note that can match this," he said.
He was also a source of inspiration for his first choice of song - "Proud" by Heather Small - which lingered with him while preparing for the Olympics and still making his pink fur swam.
Desert Island Disc will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson is not so prepared to face the Ryder Cup on Saturday to be rested
American player Phil Mickelson will create a new record on Sunday when he plays for 47 times in a Ryder Cup match, but he needs to be prepared to make up for the game's performance so as not to end with a loss.
Mickelson who will play in this two-match event for a 12-time record, has been relegated by captain Jim Furyk to the "fourballs" and "foursomes" games on Saturday.
Behind being the focus as usual for the United States, the winners of these five major games spend time being cheerleaders and practicing in the hope of improving the quality of the game.
A player who should not hit the ball directly even when at the top of his game, the 48-year-old is not the right choice for the Le Golf National golf course, where his distance is very difficult for a hit that does not meet the target.
And if this golf course were to change, Mickelson in the ninth game on Sunday would come up with British Open winner Francesco Molinari who has joined new entrant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the American player, missing four eyes starts with 12 solo games, starts out fiercely, then Mickelson's game is certainly very important.
Furyk is so confident with his players, that's all he can say.
"He understood his role today, and he patted his shoulder and put his hand on my shoulder and said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"His confidence is very high.
He is very well-known and has contributed a lot to this team since the beginning, and this week.
I can’t believe he’s going to play in two games.
I can imagine more than that, but that's the way we think we need to do it.
He wants to be the same, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most appearances in the Ryder Cup this Sunday.
This may be the last time he will join the Ryder Cup that has never matched his personal record achievement.
Mickelson won 18 times, lost 20 times and seven series, although Furyk said his presence brought one injection of spirit to his team.
"He's funny, he likes to tease, he likes to joke, he likes to wear people and it's really fun when he's in the team room," he said.
"I think all the young players have fun with him, this week, and it's fun to see him.
He's not just playing, he's more than that.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows their position ahead will slowly disappear.
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his experience that the far-flung position in front of him could be lost in the last day of the Ryder Cup and upset the situation.
The Danish player first joined the 1997 match at Valderrrama, where Seve Ballesteros drove as captain and ahead of the American team with 5 points but was only able to win by very thin with an eye count of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You continue to remind yourself after the leading position at Valderrama; we can also take the leading position at Brookline but we lose and in Valderram we win, but win thin," said Bjorn after seeing the Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and last night to be ahead with a 10-6 National points tally at Le Golf.
So history will prove to me and everyone in the team that this game is not over yet.
We're going to fight hard tomorrow.
Go out and play seriously and don't make a mistake.
It does not end until the eyes are peeled and ground on the rostrum.
We have a goal to beat this trophy, and we will focus on this goal.
I have said, I will focus on the 12 players in our team, but we all have to be aware of who our opponents are - they are the greatest players in the world.
So happy with the achievement of his men in such a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I can't possibly wake up.
Tomorrow is a new day.
Tomorrow's individual achievement needs to be ingrained and it's something different to do.
It's great to be out there with friends and when everything goes smoothly but when you're alone then your full capacity as a golfer will be tested.
This is the message that all players need to hear, give yourself the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now leave your friend and he needs to give his best in himself as well."
Contrary to Bjorn's view, his opponent Jim Furyk would expect his players to play well as individual players compared to team events, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who managed to get three eyes out of four.
Furyk himself once had an experience on the last day where positions changed, when he was in a team that was winning at Brookline before losing to surprise when European forces performed "Miracles in the Medina."
"I still remember every word broken," he said when answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, burned the player's spirit on the last day.
"We have 12 more shows tomorrow, but if you all want to start it fast as you see in Brookline, as you see in Medina.
When the momentum starts, it will put pressure on the event in the middle.
We're going to clean up our players in a way that we feel is appropriate, we're going to try to do something great tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked to fight back and clash with Rory McIlroy in the main event, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter European player who is in the top spot of the first half.
"I'm making this rule because I think it's going to catch up and cover everything," Bjorn said of the individual player's choice.
Germany's new warship has been delayed again.
The German Navy was due to receive its latest frigate in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warships, but the ship will not be ready until next year due to system damage and rising costs, according to local media reports.
The landing of the "Rhineland-Pfalz" warship, the first ship under the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate brand has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit which quoted a military spokesman.
This warship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, unfortunately the post-surgery problem hit the fate of this large project.
Four Baden-Wuertemberg-class frigate warships chartered by the Navy in 2007 would replace the Bremen-class frigate.
It is understood, it will contain features such as high-powered cannons, various anti-aircraft and anti-ship equipment as well as some casualty features such as reducing detection by radar, red lights and acoustic capabilities.
Another important feature is the longer maintenance period - the latest frigate must be able to sail up to two years from its shelf life.
However, various obstacles mean this sophisticated warship, which is said to be able to highlight German power abroad - it will be a waste of time before this ship joins the service of the Navy, according to Die Zeit.
This unfortunate F125 frigate became the headline last year, when German Navy officers did not want to command the warship in and return it to the shipbuilding company Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned the ship to its builder after delivery.
Not much is known why the ships were returned, but the German newspaper called some damage "equipments and devices" making the warship useless if sent for combat missions.
Damage to the software needs to be weighed as the Baden-Wuertemberg-class warship will be controlled by only 120 classes - half of what is needed to control the old Bremen-class frigates.
Turbulence is also something where these warships are too heavy and this will reduce performance and limit the Navy's ability to make any improvements in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" 7,000-tank is believed to be twice as heavy as warships in the same class that were once used by the German army during World War II.
In addition to the damage to the device, the overall price of the project - including the training for the class - is also an issue.
The project is said to have cost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn) - up from its original price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that struck the most recent frigate warships indicate how much the German navy's capabilities were missing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chairman of the defence committee in parliament, acknowledged that the Navy was indeed facing the problem of a lack of capable warships that could be moved.
The official also said the issue was getting worse, as the old warships that had been stopped did not get replacement warships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate warships could join the Navy.
The National Trust has taken over the lives of bats.
The latest study, which is being carried out in an aesthetic in Scotland's highlands, aims to explain why bats use the shape of the earth's face to hunt for food.
This study is expected to lead to the latest discoveries regarding the unique behaviour of mammals that are trying to fly this and can be a guide for conservation activities.
Studies by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual bats, and the soprano batrels as well as the long-eared brown bats and the Daubenton bats at Inverewe Park in Wester Ross.
A special recorder will be placed in certain locations around the property to track the activity of the ball throughout the season.
NHS workers and volunteers will also make the survey move by using mobile tracking tools.
The expert analyzes the sound of all the recordings will identify the frequency of each type of ball and its species and the actions of this ball.
A map of the habitat and the report will be produced to create a scaled-up image of the Earth's surface regarding the behavior of the bat.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser to NTS, hopes the study's findings will show the most important habitat areas to bats and how they are used by each species of bat.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management such as making sedge fields and the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined considerably since the last century.
Balls are threatened as a result of building and construction work that interferes with where the ball is thought to be and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lights are also a risk to bats equal to fly trap paper and some chemicals used to treat building materials as well as pet cat attacks.
The ball isn't really blind.
Because the mice hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use location detection techniques using sound to identify the position of insects and obstacles while in flight.
The NTS is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country.
They have ten trained experts who regularly conduct reviews, check where they respond and sometimes save the ball.
The organization has also established one of the first bat protection centers in Scotland at the Aesthetic Threadave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is where eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland live.
David Thompson, the aesthetic manager, said this is the most suitable place for a ball.
"There's a lot of room in there," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of big trees and suitable habitats.
There’s a lot more we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what bats need to live and grow.
He stressed how important it is to conduct an inspection before starting maintenance work in the property because there is a possibility that we could accidentally destroy the bat nest that would contain the bat children in which it was capable of killing 400 female bats and the bats, and possibly destroying the entire population of the bats.
Balls are protected and it is a mistake to kill, injure or disturb or destroy a nested ball.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
"There's still a lot we need to learn about bats and for many species we don't know how their populations are growing."
Ronaldo denied the allegations of rape while his lawyer was preparing to bribe the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo said the charges violated him as "fake news" and said there were people who wanted to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer will sum up the German magazine, Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese forward and Juventus are accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
His driver said he had paid $375,000 to shut the victim's mouth, according to Der Spiegel's report on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to 142 million followers hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo denounced the report as "fake news."
"Not true.
What they're saying today is fake news," the 5th Ballon d'Or award winner told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, this is part of my work.
I'm happy and everything is fine," said the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute De Spiegel on the charges, which they call "an unsubstantiated and disturbing report of personal space," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz's lawyer said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage that directly disturbs his personality, which may be one of the most serious personal rights forfeiture of recent years."
The incident was reported to take place in June 2009 in a luxury room of Hotel Palms and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported to be returning to the player's hotel room, where he was accused of visiting the woman without permission, according to an investigation paper registered at Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed after the incident the player turned in front of him and said he was "99 percent" was a "good guy" and was only stunned by "one percent."
The document confirms Ronaldo confessed to having sex, but on the basis of liking the same.
Mayorga also accused him of making police reports and taking pictures of the injuries suffered while in the hospital, but later agreed to settle them outside the courthouse because he was "feared of the response" and worried about being "disturbed by the public."
The 34-year-old woman now wants to cancel the previous settlement because she is still traumatized by what has happened.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester when the allegations occurred, and by this summer he had moved to Italian football giant Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret forever’ for losing carmaker
The UK "will forever regret" if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, Commerce Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added this was somewhat "concerned" as Toyota UK told the BBC if Britain left the European Union without a deal, it would stop production of its lost car in Burnsaston, near Derby, for a while.
"We need a solution," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of this would result in a border delivery problem if there was no solution for Brexit and this would lead to job losses.
The factory in Burnaston - which produced Toyota Auris and Avensis cars - installed nearly 150,000 units last year, 90% of them exported to other European Union countries.
"In my view, if Britain leaves the European Union without any settlement at the end of March, we will stop the production of cars at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's director of business at Burnaston.
Several other car manufacturers in the UK including Honda, BMW as well as Jaguar and Land Rover also share their concerns if the UK leaves the European Union without a solution on how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said they would close their Mini car factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main policy of car manufacturers is about the risk to supply chains if there is a Brexit without any solution.
Toyota's car production depends on the basis of installation based on timely receipt of supplies without having to be stored with the car's parts at the entrance to the factory every 37 minutes from across the UK and the European Union for rented cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without any settlement on 29 March, there is a high probability that there will be a disruption at the border that industrial players predict will be a delay and a shortage of substitutes.
Toyota is unlikely to be able to store inventory supplies more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, then production would be halted.
Mr Clark said Finance Minister Theresa May's future plans for a two-way relationship with the European Union "need to do so to avoid any checks at the border."
"We need a solution. We want a solution that will allow not only success for the present but for us to mark this opportunity," he told the BBC in the Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence not only from Toyota but also from this other manufacturer shows that we must continue this very successful supply chain.
Toyota can’t say how long its production will be stopped, but for the long term warning will increase costs and reduce the factory’s competitiveness and will result in job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the union responsible for the management of the union at the plant, said the union members had already begun to tremble: "In my experience, the lost work will not come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an accurate and robust plan for the future relationship between us and the European Union.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House said
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "rejected to next week" due to a dispute over Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy as a candidate for a permanent federal court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein, who oversees the work of Robert Mueller's special counsel's investigation, relates to Russia's interference in the election, the relationship between Trump's aides and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy prosecutor or not and further disrupt Mueller's freedom to continue the investigation has become the warmest gossip in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported Rosenstein plans to use a secret recorder tool to record his conversation with Trump and the possibility of replacing the president by using a change to 25 constitutions.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday, he was reluctant to go to the White House, behind reports that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump who was at the time in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he was "unwilling" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to prevent him from coming into contact with the confession of Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blassey Ford of one of the women who accused Kavanaugh of cheating him, in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, both of whom gave the confession.
On Friday, Trump directed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which has suspended yet another full Senate vote.
Trump's secretary of state, Sarah Sanders, appeared in Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been set, perhaps this week, I think it may be postponed for another week given some of the things that are going on in the federal court.
Let's take a look later and I will always provide the latest information to the press.
Some reporters will dispute it: Sanders has not held any White House press conference since September 10.
When Chris Wallace asked him why.
Sanders said he didn't hold many press conferences not because he didn't like TV reporters trying to get "attention," but he also said: "I don't agree because they really want attention."
Then he said the relationship between the press and Trump would increase.
"The president has held the most answering session compared to the presidents before him," he said without providing any evidence. "We have made the calculation."
The press conference will remain, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask something directly to the president of the United States, it's better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it more often, and you've seen us do a lot of that over the last few weeks and this will replace the press conference when you can speak directly to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions from the press when on the way out of the White House or when taking part in an open-ended question session or during a media hearing along with honored guests.
Media conferences in person are very rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why he sometimes made a free and odd appearance in front of a gathering of reporters.
Health secretary wrote to EU workers at the NHS about their concerns about Brexit.
The secretary of state has written a letter to all workers from the European Union working at the NHS Scotland to express their gratitude to the country and hope they will continue to work here after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP has sent a letter within a period of less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Government of Scotland has also committed to bear the cost of applying for European Union citizens working in its public sector.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the withdrawal have continued, and are heading towards a decision by the autumn.
But the UK government has stepped up preparations to face one scenario without a solution.
I know this is something that worries you all.
That's why I want to emphasize how much I appreciate the contributions of each of you, regardless of your nationality.
Co-workers from across the European Union and other countries, bring together many experiences and expertise that strengthen and improve health services and provide benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you all to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defenseman Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury after losing 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened just before the second half of the season.
"He pushed the edge line and suddenly the fox was there," Reed said.
The trainer and health officer gave Abercrombie oxygen there before putting her in the crib and taking her for further treatment.
An official from Tennessee State told Chirs Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/as far as his injuries are currently," and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injuries occurred.
Abercrombie, the first-year red dress prosecutor, played in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had already made five appearances on Saturday before leaving the game, his number of appearances this season was 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK and this excess money will be used to help the homeless under Tory's latest plan.
This move will confirm Corbyn's success to attract young voters.
This stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury is expected to quote up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the hostages
Foreigners will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - money from this will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The move seems to be a reflection of Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with a promise of providing affordable housing and making high-income people a target.
The increase in the stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, money from this result will help the government address the problems of people who do not have a residence.
This addition - is in addition to the stamp duty that has also been imposed including the higher duty that has been introduced two years ago on the second house and the house purchased for rent that may have been imposed by three percent.
The Treasury is expected to be able to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year through this move.
An estimated 13 percent of new properties in London were purchased by those who were not UK citizens, causing prices to surge and upset those who wanted to buy their first home.
Most of the luxury areas - especially in the capital - have become "simple" because many of its owners are owners of foreigners who spend a lot of time abroad.
The new policy was just announced a few weeks after Boris Johson demanded that the stamp duty be reduced so that more young people could buy their first home.
He accused a large construction company of deliberately maintaining high property prices by buying land but not developing it, and urged Mrs May to remove quotas on homes capable of tackling Britain's "shameful housing problems."
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of exciting housing reform proposals, including rent controls and repealing the "innocent" expulsion.
He also wants more power to be given to council members to build a new house.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I was going to dedicate my time as prime minister to restoring British dreams - this life must improve for every generation to come.
And that means improving our poor housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair because it is very easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad to buy a home compared to British residents who work hard here.
For too many people, the dream of owning your own home is very far away, and the fact of living in an equal place with a sense of humiliation is indeed a reality.
Jack Ross: ‘My main goal is to manage Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Rosa said his "primary goal" was to be Scotland's manager one day.
The 42-year-old is looking forward to a challenging opportunity to relegate the North-East club that is third in the League One, less than three points from the top position.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I want to represent the country as a player.
I got a call for B cap and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid, and there was something that always attracted me there.
The opportunity will only come if I succeed as a manager at the club level.
Ross' replacements as manager of Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, Dovid Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athetic said he did not feel comfortable following the so-called trail in big clubs, as he had previously rejected Barnsley's and Ipswich Town's applications.
“For me the meaning of success at the moment is ‘can I bring this club back into the Premier League?
Because of the structure and facilities that exist in this club, it should be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to achieve, but I'd consider myself successful if I could bring this club back into the Premier League."
Ross was just three years in management, after being assistant manager at Dumbarton and being one of the coaches at Hearts' for 15 months.
He later helped Alloa return to stage three after being downgraded and changed the fate of St Mirren from being downgraded to becoming a Champion the following season.
And according to Ross, he is very comfortable now compared to when he was a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's an option," he recalls, when he manages Alloa.
"I know that the field of management is really close to me, rather than playing.
Maybe it's weird because I'm successful, can live happily ever after and enjoy some interesting moments.
It's a bit difficult to play.
There are a lot of things you need to go through every week.
I still go through it in terms of pressure and pressure to work as a player but as a manager I am more comfortable.
I’ve always wanted to take care of it and now I’m doing it, and I feel comfortable doing something I’ve loved throughout my adult life.”

The best time to drink beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, according to a study.
This summer's heatwaves bring a wave to British pubs that are facing problems but the chain restaurants are also under pressure.
The group of pubs and bars showed a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but in restaurants it dropped 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consultancy firm that collects these figures, said: "The continued heat and longer England World Cup campaigns mean July will follow the pattern of June, where pubs rose 2.8 percent, with the exception of restaurants declining worse.
The drop of 1.8 percent in restaurant business in June worsened in July.
The performance of the pubs that prioritize drinks and bars is very strong compared to the declining restaurants.
Pubs that prioritize food also experience bad luck as a result of the hot weather, but are not as bad as restaurant operators.
It seems that most people just want to go out for a beer.
Pubs and bars recorded a 6.6 percent increase in sales for the month, while food dropped 3 percent.
Paul Newman, an entertainment and food analyst at RSM, said: "This decision seems to be still the same and has been ongoing since the end of April.
Weather and social events or sports events are still a major factor in the increase in sales in the market outside the home.
Unsurprisingly, the group of restaurants is still shrinking, sales are down 4.8 percent if it comes to this year's comparisons certainly worse with cost pressures again.
The long summer weather hit restaurant operators at a bad time and only time will determine if cooler weather like we experienced in August will bring relief."
The number of increases in sales in pubs and restaurants, including the new one, was 2.7 percent in July, indicating a dampness in the newly introduced brand.
Observers for the sales sector at UK pubs, bars and restaurants The Coffer Peach Tracker collected and analyzed data performance from 47 groups operating with a turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion is an industry benchmark.

A study by the UK's Digital Awareness and the Great Teachers' Conference (HCM) of independent schools found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 years old had two profiles, with more than half of them admitting they kept a personal account.
HCM Chairman Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying to see so many teenagers trapped creating an online space where parents and teachers can't track them."
Eilidh Doyle will be a "voice to athletes" at Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the Scottish Athletics as non-executive director during the governing body's general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's best-known racing athlete and Ian Beattie's chairman explains this move is an opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from Doyle's extensive experience internationally for more than a decade.
"Ilidh is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the international athlete community and we are confident that the athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from his participation in this institution," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be a voice to all athletes and I hope to contribute and help guide this sport in Scotland.
This American sportsman who once won the gold medal for the 200-meter and 400-meter events at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta now owns four Olympic gold medals and now makes a cover for the BBC, after being unable to walk due to a heart attack (transient ischemic attack).
He said: "I was hit with a stroke last month.
I can't walk.
The doctor said that only time can determine the stage at which I can recover.
It's not as easy to be as it once was, I need to learn to walk again and today I need to make an intelligence exercise!
Thank you for all your support!"
Mother's milk pump ads that make comparisons with cows bring conflicting opinions online
A mother's milk pump manufacturer got a variety of opinions that clashed online because their ads compared breastfeeding mothers with cows being milked for milk.
To launch what is known as the "silent and wearable mother's milk pump of the world's first" user technology company Elvie released a humorous music video to show the freedom that mothers can feel using this new pump.
Four mothers dance in a straw-filled herd of cows to a song where the lyrics read: "Yes, I'm a milk pump myself, but you can't see any tail" and "if you don't realize this is not a white, it's my breast."
He said, "I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out,
However, this ad published on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views, and hundreds of comments, the video has invited a variety of reactions from the general public, many who say it gives a glamorous picture of the dairy industry that is "downgrading".
"It's an unnatural decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows need to graze and have to give birth to a baby to produce milk, but unfortunately, cows get divorced from their mothers within a few days of their birth," said a writer.

Another commented: "It's like a trauma to cows and cows.
"But what does it mean to use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who can keep their children?"
Another added: "One advertisement that doesn't have to be about direct."
Others defended the ad, with a woman claiming that she found the song "very funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'll buy one if I still give my body milk.
It makes me feel like a cow.
The advertisement was a little crazy but I think it's as shown.
"It's a great product," he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad aimed at mums pumping (usually at work or in the toilet) and feeling like a "bunny."
This is not an ad that compliments or assesses the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they had all been dancing with a hidden pump in their underwear.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the assumption that most women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's Pam is completely silent, has no wire or tube and can be hidden in clothes in milking, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby, and also out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "Pam Elvie is such a revolutionary product, it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women who pump with dairy cows, we want to put body milking and all the challenges associated with it as the main focus, while showing a way that is entertaining and related to the feeling of being free through the use of a new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has been headlined.
During London Fashion Week, a mother to two children appeared on stage for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Child Abductions Move Silently to Home Camps on Texas Border
The number of migrants detained has increased despite the fact that the monthly border move has not changed much, due to the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration, making it increasingly difficult to place children with guarantors.
According to tradition, guarantors are undocumented immigrants, and they are afraid to affect their position to continue living in the country if they take a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that guarantors and other adult members of the family would need to hand over their fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement officer, told Congress that the agency had detained dozens of individuals who had applied to be guarantors for unguarded children.
The agency confirmed that 70 percent of those detained did not have a previous criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either guarantors or family members of guarantors, are here illegally and most of them are unlicensed immigrants.
With that, we will continue to hunt for that individual," Albence said.
In order to process children more quickly, the authorities introduced new regulations requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, not after 60 days according to previous standards, according to protection workers.
Many will be present through video conference calls, rather than in person, to appeal their case for a legal position before an immigrant judge.
Those deemed unfit for assistance will be deported immediately.
The longer the children are under arrest, they will be more likely to become anxious or sluggish, and this will lead to belligerent actions or attempts to escape, according to security officials and according to reports released by the system in recent months.
Supporters said the concern was higher in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that children struggling with feelings may not be noticeable, due to the size of the place.
They added that by moving children to the city of camp without providing time for them to be emotionally ready, or saying goodbye to friends may worsen the trauma they are facing.
Syria's U.S., French, and Turkish troops immediately retreated.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem urged Syria to return, even though the war in the country had reached its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting violence "will take appropriate action."
"They should step back immediately and unconditionally," he told the court.
Moualem stressed that the "war on violence has ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have lost their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "relieve this holy war so that we eliminate Syrian territory" from both violent groups and "any foreign occupation".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, special for training and advising Kurdish and Arab Syrian troops against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of the escape, Moualem said the situation was appropriate for them to return, and he accused "several foreign countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that caused the escape not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help this return," he said.
"They're politicizing what's supposed to be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given reconstruction aid until a political agreement is held between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The U.N. diplomat said an agreement between Russia and Turkey to provide a military-free zone in the rebel-held Idlib region had created opportunities to continue political disengagement.
The Russian-Turkish talks have diverted a major attack by a Russian-backed Syrian army in the region where three million people live.
Moualem said the deal had a "real-time limit" and expected military action to target jihadists including rebels from the Nusra Front, which is linked to Al Qaeda, which "will be eliminated."
The UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to organize the first meeting for a new committee, which includes government and opposition members to draft post-war amnesty and pave the way for elections.
Moualem stated the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "checking current constitutional articles," and warning of the disruption.
Trump will win the second term.
With that logic, Trump will win the re-election in 2020, but, as expected by liberal observers, accusations of dismissal and scandals end his presidential tenure ahead of time.
In an undisputed situation as "the most dramatic finale for a president's tenure!"
At the moment, there is no sign of a leak.
Since 2014, the prime time rating has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average prime time audience of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million, four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has ahead of the cable ratings, up to 3.5 million viewers on the night of the prime news.
"This is a fire that attracts people's attention because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, the ABC drama's editor-in-chief of "Designated Survivor," a story about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
He recalled a taxi ride before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because he made me laugh,'" Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is value in entertainment.
True, unlike on TV, the storyline of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite or global economic health.
Not following development is just a pleasure for a lucky audience.
However, it’s a far cry from being a knowledgeable citizen when you find you’re watching a panel of experts arguing over the use of ‘deep background’ by Bob Woodward’ in the search for a source for his book “Fear,” a $15,000 peacock bomber jacket, by Paul Manafort (“the thickest and thickest of Washington’s cloths with a megahose,” by Bob Woodward.
I won’t see Super Mario with the same view again.
"Some of what he does is in a reality show that looks like he prepares you for something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pawn Stars," about Trump's story of acting exchanges and daily plot exchanges (starting a fight with N.F.L.)
You can't miss an episode or you'll miss it.
When I visited Fleiss this week, the weather outside his house in the north of Kauai was bright 80 degrees, but he was trapped in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He must not leave the TV, not when Brett Kavanaugh is set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is still uncertain.
"I remember when we made a crazy performance before and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western Civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke but they were real farts."

Foreign money flooded into a fierce contest of mid-term elections
Not surprisingly, the election to Pennsylvania's 17th showed an influx of money, as the reconvening of the congressional district showed two incumbents are now contesting for the same seat.
Pittsburg's re-painted suburban area rivaled Democratic deputy Conor Lamb - who won his seat in the previous spring's special election.
Lamb is competing against other current incumbents, Republican Rep. Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th area of old Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The map was repainted when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old area had been gerrymandered alongside the Republican.
The match in the new 17th has begun a fierce financial campaign match between the main party financial machinery of the Democratic Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a common name heard in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in the Mac special election for the 18th Pennsylvania congressional district.
The seat has been won by Republicans for a decade, and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points.
A politically intelligent group has given the Democrats an advantage.
U.S. to Resign El Salvador for Support of China, Resign
Diplomats of the Dominican Republic and Panama have recognized Beijing, with little negative response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pulled out of the Trump Organization's management team.
Government Department officials have decided to recall the heads of American diplomatic representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest decision not to recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the fine is only imposed on El Salvador's density, which received a $140 million budget in the form of American aid in 2017, including drug control and economic support.
The proposed fines, including cuts to financial aid and visa enforcement, will have a negative impact on the Central American country with high rates of unemployment and murder.
After the internal meeting was held, North and Central American officials suspended a high-level trial that focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year that appeared to be a positive step in preventing immigrants from heading to the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials decided that they wanted the trial to continue, effectively halting any consideration to bribe El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now give a speech at the trial, scheduled for mid-October, as an import signal to the administration's meeting, the diplomat said.
And the three American representatives returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no clear message or fines from Washington.
White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who had agreed to discuss internal considerations on the condition of anonymity.
Their statements are supported by external analysts who are closely associated with the administration and also speak on the terms of anonymity.
A study of history
What will happen next is likely to be a report by the special counsel Robert Mueller on the possibility of a obstruction of justice by Trump, which now has strong evidence in the public record.
Mueller will also delay an investigation into whether the Trump campaign has joined Russia in an attack on our election.
If Congress exchanges hands, Trump will face responsibility for the party, as soon as he is ready to face the voters, and possibly eventually a jury containing his peers.
That's all if, and I'm not saying that the fall of Trump must have happened - or someone like him in Europe.
There are choices that we all need to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will impact how long these wrinkles last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make an attempted coup d'état against Hitler, if the West did not follow Hitler and support the Czechoslovak in Munich.
We have failed, and have missed the opportunity to avoid the brutal killings that took place over the next few years.
The journey of history revolves around such an inflection point, and the unhindered journey of democracy will be accelerated or suspended.
The American people are facing some of these inflection points now.
What would we do if Trump fired Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person who oversees Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper made a report that, last year, he had planned to make a presidential record and made speculation that the president was unfit for the post.
Rosenstein said The Times' statement was inaccurate.
"How are we going to act if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is confirmed to the Agong Court despite allegations of actual sexual assault and evidence of fraud?
And what's more, are we going to vote for the congressional deadline that Trump will be responsible for?
If we fail the test, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was of Czechoslovak Jewish descent who had been expelled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had conquered the home of my embassy.
He survived, moved to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light a Sabbath candle on a table that had swastikas.
With that as my legacy, how am I not optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers optimistic about the battle with Rapid Vienna
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against Austria, following a series with Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify them in Group G in the European League.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his debut this season until the 2-2 series with Villarreal, but he believed the Rangers used this decision as a stepping stone to a great victory.
"It's a good point because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We played in this game with the confidence that we'll get something and we've got one eye.
We may win at the end of the game, but the series may be a fairer result.
They may play better in the first half and we also play better in the second half and in the better side.
On Thursday, another great European night.
We hope we get three points but the game is difficult because they got a good decision in the previous game but, the audience supports us, I am sure we will play well and get a positive result.
Last year it was really hard, among all that happened to my injuries, and the turnover in the club but there was a fun feeling factor about this place right now.
The squad is good and the team feels fun; the training is also good.
We hope we can do our best, leave last season and succeed."

Although the survey participants have a real idea of how they want to be maintained, some have even talked to their family members about it.
Half of the induvidu in a nationwide study said that they had discussed with their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent talked to their children about it.
"They want family members to take care of them but don't take steps to talk," said Holly Snyder, vice president of insurance business across the country.
Here's how to get started.
Talking to your spouse and child: You won't be able to provide family to provide care for you if you don't tell them first.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these options will be an important factor in knowing the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you get a way to pay for those expenses.
Financing funds for long-term care can include traditional long-term care insurance policies, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help protect these expenses or self-insurance with your wealth - as long as you have the money.
Finish your legal documents: Finish the legal war at the same time.
Set the health care representative in place so that you can appoint the individual you trust to oversee your health care and ensure the professional is at your discretion if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the power of attorney for your finances.
You will choose the person you trust to make a decision for you and make sure your bill is paid if you don't try.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine your parents have a medical emergency and on their way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Describe this in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the money that's set, but who's the doctor?" asked Martin.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that broke the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, the death toll is expected to rise.
In the absence of a communications system, authorities could not obtain information from the government of Donggala, a northern area of Palu adjacent to the earthquake center with a magnitude 7.5 scale quake.
In Palu more than 16,000 people have been displaced after the disaster struck.
Here are the main facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating its 40th anniversary during the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala government area 300 km (180 miles) off the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The region, the administrative region under the region, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the economic backbone of the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the Donggala water area.
Nickel mining is also important in this region, but only concentrated in Morowali, on the beach opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by Tsumani several times in 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in the Donggala.
The tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing 9 people.
Indonesia is seismically located in the Pacific Fire Circle and is always hit by an earthquake.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Acheh region of Indonesia in northern Sumatra on 26 December has triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the waters of the Indian Ocean, half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on Nias Island on Sumatra beach.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang City, the capital of the West Sumatra region.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, in Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed in 300 people.
2016: A moderate earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya government area of Acheh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the events of the great destruction of the earthquakes and tsumnami in 2004.
No tsunamis were triggered at the time, but more than 100 victims were caused by the collapse of the building.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, especially in the northern part of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded temporarily at the time.
Sarah Palin's son-in-law arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska Governor-elect Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was detained, suspected of committing domestic attacks, disrupting reports of domestic violence crimes and opposing detention, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to police reports, while a female friend tried to make a police call to report the crime, she had taken the phone from the woman.
Palin was held hostage at Mat-Su's pre-talk facility and held with an unaccounted bond amounting to $500, KTUU reports.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he had confessed "absolutely, innocently" when asked about the confession, the network reports.
Palin faces three minor Class A offenses, meaning he may be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged under Class B minor offenses, which could be fined a day in jail and fined as much as $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
This case is referred to the Alaska Military Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, disrupting reports of domestic violence crimes and possessing weapons in drunken circumstances related to the incident.
Palin's girlfriend claimed the man was banging her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veteran soldiers in 2016 after associating her son's violent actions with PTSD following her service in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake Tsunami: One Hundred Victims
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity supply and communications networks are also affected by the death toll expected to rise in the next day.
The earthquake struck outside Tangah Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos broadcast on social media show at the time of the event.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach to celebrate a party in the city of Palu during a tsunami hitting the beach.
Prosecutors demand extraordinary death penalty for suspected NYC terror attack
New York prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a New York City suspect of a terror attack that killed eight people -- an extraordinary punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was accused of using the Home Depot rental truck to carry out attacks on bicycle routes along the West Coast Highway in Lower Manhattan, paving the way for pedestrians and cyclists on his way on Oct.
In order to justify the death penalty, the plaintiffs need to prove that Saipov "wanted" to kill eight of the victims and "wanted" to wear serious body injuries, according to a notice with intent to prosecute the death penalty, filed in the Southern District, New York.
Both charges lead to the death penalty, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury has charged Saipov with 22 charges including eight counts of murder caused by illegal activities, which have always been used by prosecutors in planned crime cases, and one charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "careful planning and planning", according to the prosecutor, describing how Saipov carried out the act as "student, cruel and disgusting."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pangnucco," the statement read.
Five of the victims are tourists from Argentina.
It has been a long time since the Southern District of New York claimed the death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, has been charged with murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed on the New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the couple who had been subjected to the punishment after they were convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death using an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not feel guilty on the day and month after the attack, according to court documents.
He made a statement to the investigators that he was happy with what he was doing, according to police.
Saipov said he was encouraged to carry out the attack after seeing an ISIS video on the phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in the hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal martial lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We feel the decision to prosecute the death penalty versus accepting guilty confessions for life imprisonment with no possibility of being released, only prolonging the trauma of this event for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense has previously asked the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.
According to Tory MPs, Nigel Farage should be responsible for conducting the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to "raise the people's army" today during protests at Tory's trial.
Former Ukip chairman Ukip said politicians need to "feel the coal" from Eurosceptics - because one of Theresa May's MPs, recommends he should be given the responsibility to control negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the UK would "come out now" if Farage became Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing May is to resolve the split between members who support the Remain Tories who join the opposition to Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to ensure that Chequers' plans to back down remain in place amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remains and the EU.
The Allies insisted May held talks with Brussels despite the impact it had had - and the Eurosceptic and Labour powers to choose between his package or 'crazy'.
Bone tells the gathering Out means Out in Solihull who wants to "get rid of the Chequers."
He recommended Farage to be made a nobility and given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
"If he's given that responsibility, we're out now," he said.
Parliamentarian Wellingborough added: "I support Brexit but we must remove the Chequers."
Defying the EU, he said: "We are not fighting in a world war to be slaves.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay wrong at all."
Tory's Brexit supporter, Andrea Jenkyns, who also followed the march, told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people's voices.
"Chequers are not popular among the public, the Opposition will not vote in favour, it is not popular in our party and the activists who are on the streets and who have voted for us.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The prime minister will continue to serve their post if they keep their promise."
Farage said politicians need to "feel the brakes" if they want to betray the decisions made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is the trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here to tell them 'we're not going to let them get away with doing that.'
In a message to an enthusiastic audience he added: "I want you to create our political class, which is almost betraying Brexit, to feel its coal.
“We are preparing for a people’s army that gives us victory in Bexit and will not rest until we make the United Kingdom free, have a government of our own, proud.”
Meanwhile, Remainer rowed through Birmingham before holding a rally in the middle of the city.
Activists threw out Tories' shoes against Brexit after the group's launch on the weekend.
Peer Labour Lord Adonis taunted the Conservatives about the safety issues they faced with the party's application at the start of the trial.
"They said they could have an IT system in place and all the technology with Canada and so on, for the border without conflict, for the borderless trade," he added.
"It's all a play.
"There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'explore' to compete for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "examine to compete for the presidency" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that Massachusetts Democrats delivered their plans for the future during the ‘town hall’ in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a tough critic of President Donald Trump, was contesting for re-election in November with GOP state Rep Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Massachusetts Trump campaign.
He is speculated to be competing with Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with users using the ‘town hall’ format since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he wanted to run for president.
Warren replied it was time "for women to Washington to repair a broken kingdom, and this included a woman on the top stairs."

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship pit when the team orders him to win, kills Sebastian Vettel
It was obvious at the time, Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday," the Mercedes team's instructions played an important role in this race.
From the start of the pitch, Bottas started well, nearly defeating Hamilton while maintaining his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel entered the pit first and left Hamilton in traffic at the end of the group, something that should have been finalized.
Mercedes then went into the pit on the next lap and out behind Vettel, but Hamilton then made a tire action to the tire that left Ferrari's driver free in part at risk to defend himself after the action defended a third angle.
Max Verstappen started from the back grid and was in seventh place after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then went ahead for most of the race and did not change the tyre to target a quick finish and asked Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He came into the pit in the 44th round but could not improve the pace for the next eight rounds when Raikkonen was in fourth place.
It's a tough day for Valtteri who has made a good race throughout the weekend and being a man of conscience allowed me to skip.
The team has done a good job of winning first and second place," Hamilton said.
That's an unkind language of movement.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday over a woman's plea that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing potential court Justice Agong Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault charges.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not give a direct answer about the testimony given in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what happened in the Senate showed people "shameful and ugly and liars."
"One thing that can happen and a beautiful thing happened a few days ago in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry and cruel and ugly people and liars," he said.
"When you look at exposure and leaks and they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you fired?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not leaking."
All right, wait a minute.
"We're not going to do that," he added, adding that the senator's face was not visible.
Feinstein had been sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and the letter had been leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I'm not casting charges on Dr. Ford, I'm not leaking the story," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He told me to keep it as hard and I kept it as hard as requested."
But the woman's disapproval of the president, who commented at Saturday's meeting: "I'm telling you, it's an unpleasant language of movement.
Maybe he didn't do that, but that's the worst language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the potential Agong Court, which has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges to achieve their own ends.
"They are determined to regain power in any way.
You see, cruelty, visibility, they don't care who they hurt, who they sacrifice to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee star relented the Elite League's defeat for Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the game back 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants advanced with a two-goal victory through a blow from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie softened the host position before Dwyer recovered the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard equalised eyes for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen guaranteed a win for them.
This is the third Elite League defeat for the season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from below to kill Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The opening for Dwyer arrived at the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's help, with David Rutherford providing help while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
With what looked like a busy opening time, Sullivan raised his host's eyes at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became an assistant to Cownie's disguise at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants won the game during the first half when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first half.
The hosts then regrouped and Bouchard again equalized the situation by scoring a goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined helping Nielsen give Dundee the first win in a late match in the second and he secured the win with the fifth team in the middle of the last half.
The Giants, who have lost four of the five games are at home, Milton Keynes for the next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controllers Victims to Make Sure Hundreds Above Aircraft Cross Earthquake
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are seen as heroes after being killed after making sure the aircraft carrying hundreds of passengers managed to disembark.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, sparking a tsunami.
The violence continued to hit the area and many were trapped in the collapse of the city of Palu.
Although his friend escapes, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan, refuses to leave his seat at a powerful control tower at the Sis Al Jufri Pearl Airport in Palu.
He didn't hesitate to make sure the 6321 Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely disembark.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt the tower would collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost it this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to listen to this news," he added.
Authorities were concerned that the death toll could hit thousands with disaster mitigation agencies saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
"The death toll continues to rise due to many bodies still under collapse as well as many uncontactable," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The 6-meter-high ridge has destroyed the Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
The military and commercial aircraft will bring in assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings back the corpse.
Clean water is hard to obtain.
A small shop is being built everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, International Red Cross Chairman in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross organization is in a hurry to provide assistance to survivors but we don't know what will be found there.
It's a tragedy, but things can get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to the transfer.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says a passenger is missing after plane crash
The airline that controls the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia said one passenger was missing after saying all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the sinking aircraft.
Water Niugini said in a broadcast that since Saturday afternoon, the company has not been sure of the safety of a male passenger.
The airline said the company was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline does not respond immediately to requests for further details about the passengers, such as age and fitness.
The local boat helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water during an attempt to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all of them were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the actual sequence of events is still unclear.
The U.S. Air Force and Air Force said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses felt the aircraft was being diverted from the runway.
According to American passenger Bill Jaynes, the plane entered the runway in low condition.
"That's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the other passengers managed to cross the water as high as the waist to the emergency door of the sinking aircraft.
He said the passengers were in a state of panic and screaming, and he only got a slight head injury.
The navy said the crew of the ship near the repaired dock also provided assistance by using a re-attached boat to move passengers to the beach before the plane sank into 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Flight Safety Network provided 111 people have been killed in a PNG-registered plane crash in the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyzers give a woman's nighttime line burned alive
Prosecutors have remanded a case on Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the Department of Justice, described him for several hours as an expert witness in the field of smart analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used a mobile phone record to orchestrate the movement of the 29-year-old defender Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night he was killed.
Rowlett said he received some location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of his death, clashing with previous charges, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed his cell phone along with Chambers' phone as he claimed it along with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court and stated that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was right, that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had "lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another conflict was, Trellis said he recognized Chambers two weeks before the woman's death.
Mobile phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said after Chamber's death, Tellis had deleted the text of Chamber's call and contact information from his phone.
"He's taken that woman out of his life," Hale said.
The district attorneys are scheduled to begin closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that evening.
The High Breed: What is hip hop?
The hip hop trio want to change the negative view of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims hip hop has changed far from their original purpose, i.e. political messages and mitigating social problems.
They want to go back to the basics and make hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen the latest revival in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York Times reports that the couple was fired for "racist" text.
New York City prosecutors charged the couple with discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text that had been denied being sent from the alleged mother that she was "another black person."
The couple denied they were racist, equated the bribery act as "straightening."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her disappointment when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"I don't think it's worth it," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in the text.
She wanted to send the text to her husband, instead she had sent the message to Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman who felt "less comfortable" had fired Maurice, and said that the previous caregiver, an African-American, was not doing well and he expected the presence of a caregiver from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home with Uber.
Now, Maurice bribed the couple to get compensation for the dismissal, and demanded compensation in $350 a day for six months, in exchange for the loss of the residence he had offered, even though there was no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has responded to allegations that they are racist, saying the act of ending Maurice's service is reasonable because they feel the woman is unreliable after offending the woman's perception.
"My hysteria has sent something he didn't mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"But are you going to put your child's care on someone you've done rudely, even if it's a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
No."
Disguising the apparent act as a "crush," Plasco said his wife had just given birth to a child for two months and was in a "difficult situation."
“You want to wear someone in a situation like that?
It's not a good thing," added the investment manager.
During the case, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social media, attacking them against their actions and logic.
Paddington's publisher worries readers are having a hard time connecting to a talking bear, a new letter reveals
Bond's son, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the condition of the person who reads the book first before the book is published.
It's really sad when we know about Paddington's success."
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a children's book, a small toy bear, was optimistic about her work being rejected, the woman added, celebrating the book's 60th anniversary as a "sweetheart" after her father's death last year.
Regarding Paddington, he described him as "the most important member of our family," he added, his father was proud of his success in the end.
"The father of a quiet man, he is not someone who likes to talk big," he said.
"But, by the way Paddington is too alive for him, like you feel like you have a child who achieves something you're proud of even if it's not the one you make it.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
"Although the bear is his creation and imagination, he always lends credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter is pregnant and I need to say goodbye by phone.
After landing, the girl was sent to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, Nice in a hurry where the doctor had worked hard to save her life.
"Nad called me frequently to say that the situation was bad and he would not be able to be saved," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that he was going to die in two minutes and I need to say goodbye to him.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, baby.
I'll be by your side soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicine given by the doctor to pump his heart slowly out and leave his system.
He died before his time and this is all turned off.
I just sat there and waited, knowing this was going to happen.
I can't scream or cry or cry because I'm in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold on."
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now in mourning for the loss of her child, boarded a plane with another passenger - who was unaware of the bitter experience she experienced.
"No one knows," he said.
"I lowered my head, and the tears flowed at all times.
It's hard to describe, but on this trip I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.”
A woman sends a postcard to avoid suicide on the bridge.
Two women who lose loved ones who kill themselves, work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have aired a letter on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers to be contacted for support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to experience depression and suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any mom to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a potential snitch with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knows him with his smile.
They always say that their smile can turn on any room."
However, he stopped working before he died, as he was in "a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother met his brother after his brother killed himself.
Davis said: "I'm worried that this will cause the effects of other things to happen."
Davis created the card, "to inform the people that there is someone you can meet and talk to, even if he is a friend.
Don't just sit in silence - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost her husband Mark for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we saw a change in his behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas day - when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look at them or anything."
He said the death of his partner was a big trauma to them, but they had to overcome it: "He made a big hole in the family.
It made us break up.
But we have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the FBI's investigation.
"I think, if we can get what he wants - a limited-time investigation, a limited scope - we can bring to unity," Flake said on Sunday, adding that the committee was "crazy" in a stalemate based on a rigged belief.
Why did Kavanaugh and Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
It's because of their limitations.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, and on November 6 - if, as expected, Republican decisions are not satisfactory, they will grow weak to get the people they want to run for the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has made a call to the Senator, lobbying them for Kavanaugh, who once worked at the White House for Bush and through Bush has met his wife Ashley, who became Bush's secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has released the report?
The election will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will be present.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will get 50 votes from the Senate seat, which will allow Mike Pence, vice president, to equalise the series and confirm his position in the Agong Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'down' below Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took office seven years ago, according to South Korean legislation.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Southern union ministry, said there were 1,127 defectors last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by people smugglers were a major factor.
Pyongyang does not provide any public comment.
Most of North Korea's defectors will be offered South Korean escorts.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Military Free Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors as illegal immigrants rather than as political refugees and often sends them back by force.
Relations between the North and the South - technically still at war - have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for a discussion centered on the need for tough nuclear power talks.
This comes after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in a common sense to move towards nuclear-freedom on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of slowing talks since the event.
"Without any confidence from the U.S., our country's security is not guaranteed and therefore, we will not initiate nuclear disarmament first," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "emotion," and inappropriately takes care of in Agong Court
Council Minority Chairman Nancy Pelosi called Agong's future Court Brett Kavanaugh "emotion" and said his bearing was inappropriate to hold a post in Mahlamah Agong.
Pelosi made the following review in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Party in Austin, Texas.
"I believe if a woman behaves like that, they will say the woman is 'emotional,'" Pelosi said of the reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he had committed a sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford while they were both teenagers.
During the opening ceremony, Kavanaugh roared, sometimes almost screaming and crying when discussing family and while in high school.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "excessive and pollution of a well-designed name" managed by the still angry liberal Hilary Clinton killed in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's statement confirmed that he was unfit to hold office in Agong Court, as he showed that he was heavily opposed to the Democrats.
"I feel he has removed his own qualifications and his actions against the Clinton and Democrat families," he said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if he would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats got a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this -- if he's not speaking right to Congress and the FBI, he's not eligible to hold office in Agong Court, but only in the court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decision against the Act of Custody or Roe v. Wade, as he was regarded as a conservative court.
In the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided answering whether he would change the Agong Court's decision.
"It's not the time for someone to rush, weigh sideways to go to court and expect us to say, 'it's a fun step,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to show it.
It is a natural noun, an inflammation that months and years abound, and he does not restrain anger without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's a good thing, do you?"
"I was helped by a woman, an executive in one place, who said she also cried when angry, but had created one technique, if she felt angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
Then he continued.
And I think that's a wise suggestion."
Crying is allowed as a way of channeling anger because it is always misunderstood.
One of the most memorable memories of the old job, in the male-dominated office, I found myself crying with an unstoppable sense of anger, I was pulled by an older woman on the neck - a cold manager I was annoyed with - pulling me into the stairwell.
"Don't show them your tears," she told me.
"They don't know you're dead.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to make you sad."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Colorado congresswoman, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was arrested for having a difficult relationship in a boat called Monkey Business out of the game, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, felt there was no reason to stop her from joining the presidential campaign.
"It's not a carefully planned decision," he said, laughing at me 30 years later.
"There are seven more candidates competing and they don't need another candidate.
Someone called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Due to events happening at the end of the campaign, the woman was left behind in an effort to set up a tube, and she vowed not to compete until she earned $2 million.
It is a futile struggle.
He found his supporter who gave $1,000 to the man would give him only $250.
"Do they think I can get away with it?" he asked.
When he says he won't launch a formal campaign, he feels a variety of feelings - grateful to those who support him, disappointed with the system that makes him ask for donations and that targets non-candidates, and angry at sexism - and he feels sly.
"You'd think I had a broken heart," Schroeder recalled about how the media reacted to him.
"You'll think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember when I thought about it, what would it put on my nexus stone?
"He's crying?"
U.S.-China trade war may benefit Beijing
The outbreak of the beginning of the U.S.-China trade war may be puzzling, and even if the battle is not yet over, the dispute between the two countries may benefit Beijing in the long run, experts said.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by charging taxes on Chinese exports including solar panels, iron and aluminum.
This week's most significant increase comes at a new rate that will affect $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) of the item's value, the impact of which is like taxing over half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing responds the same way every time, most recently, it charges a five to ten percent tariff on over 60 billion American goods.
China has vowed to retaliate against the U.S. each for action, and the world's second-largest economy is not impressed.
To make Washington retreat is to be subject to U.S. will, but subjugating the U.S. is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
According to experts, if Beijing plays cards correctly, the pressure of the U.S. Trade War could positively support China in the long run by lowering the .reliability between the two countries.
"Political decisions by either Washington or Beijing can start an uncontrolled economic situation in any country and appear more dangerous than the observer has previously been informed," said Abigail Grace, a research fellow who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of political refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria said it was ready for a return to the country's political will to escape and called for help in redeveloping a country destroyed by the seven-year war.
Speaking at the UN's Agong Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made to combat violence," he said.
The government will continue to restore areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to restore to normal conditions.
The situation is now ready for a return of the will to escape, to a country they are forced to leave behind because of the violence and unilateral economic measures that affect their daily lives and the eyes of their search.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to develop the devastated country.
But he insisted the country would not receive conditional aid or aid from a country that supports the uprising.

There was a time this morning when we gave the bronze to the European troops.
We tried our best.
Congratulations to Thomas.
