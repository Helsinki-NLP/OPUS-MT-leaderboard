Traffic Flow is the analysis of the flow of individual drivers and vehicles between the two stations and the intersections of each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to research the flow of vehicles because it is impossible to predict the driving behaviour with one-half percent knowledge.
In general, the behaviors of the drivers are generally the same; therefore, each vehicle has a similar appearance, and the image can be obtained in a positive way.
In order to better demonstrate the flow of traffic, the connections have been established between three main characteristics: (1) the flow, (2) the flow, and (3) the velocity.
