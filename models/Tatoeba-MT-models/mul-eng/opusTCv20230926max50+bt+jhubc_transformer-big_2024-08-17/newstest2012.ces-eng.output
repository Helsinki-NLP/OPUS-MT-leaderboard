Parliament did not support the novel liberating Tymoshenko
Ukraine’s parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal a paragraph in the criminal code, on the basis of which the leader of the opposition, Yulia Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would pave the way for the release of the imprisoned ex-premier, was rejected by the MPs at the second reading of the proposal to mitigate the penalties for economic crimes.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for the conclusion of an allegedly unfavourable contract with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not valid and the appeal is due to be heard by the court in December.
Tymoshenko refers to the ruling on the political revenge of the regime, suspicion of involvement of the court triggered the process in the West as well.
The proposal to remove paragraph 365 from the penal code, on the basis of which the ex-premier was convicted, supported the vote of 147 MEPs.
It required 226 votes in favour.
Category: Libyan victories
The story of the Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its defeat.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him is after the war.
It remains to define the winner.
As is the custom in the region, the Islamists win the elections, but it is about whether moderation or radicalism.
The Transitional National Council has applied to the customary law of sharia and we already have a certain idea of it.
Libya will become a country without criminality, because behind theft the hand is cut off.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible wastes of faith await execution, and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, a society consisting of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
In Libya, there will be an order that we cannot imagine and which we certainly would not want.
But our way of life is not the only way, nor objectively the best, and would most likely not be suitable for change to the Libyans just mentioned.
In fact, it’s amazing that Islamic fighters have taken the bait with the help of non-believers dogs.
The only regret is that, from their point of view, the NATO attacks were not directed by a general from America, but by Alah, whose size was celebrated with every action.
Thus, when the winners are sought in Libya, the West does not belong among them.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians, in the person of the dictator, got rid of the political ally without guaranteeing any profit.
After recent bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
As a result, there is a problem with the expulsion of the "cruisers".
But will they have oil company without occupation for the slime of Libyan black gold?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of the inexhaustible protection of human rights.
So if we don't let those sharia law-abiding people do this to us.
A new era of crisis has begun.
France and the rest of Europe are in search of investors
The statistical storm surged across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual states have published data on GDP for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated intermittently, Germany and France are growing.
Today, however, the debt market is breaking records.
Investors no longer only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary estimates of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
Both countries were also adjusting data for the second quarter, in which Germany was better than expected (an increase of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), so France reported that it appeared in a slight decline of 0.1% (original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, the gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated in the quarter and, according to the <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A>, confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic performance growth.
The results are worse than analysts' estimates.
The most important events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy grew 1.5 per cent year-on-year, but stagnated year-on-year.
The German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonal figures.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2 percent between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy fell 5.2 per cent year-on-year.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The incomes of Italian and Spanish bonds are growing to critical limits.
Problems are starting to feel even Austria, Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
Earnings on Czech 10-year bonds are below 4%, although the situation in the region is worsening.
From Germany there are voices that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and celebrate the procedure for 200 million
The football team’s most difficult task of the season has managed!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czechs and beautiful goalkeeper Petr Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, she won 1:0.
Czech football, even with a large portion of luck in the second half, took a luxurious leap out of home football and will not miss the European championship again.
IHNED.cz followed the progress of the match in detailed reporting.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a big portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech national team, thanks to the domestic defeat at the end, the great Czechs and the hero Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek won in Montenegro with a happy 1:0 victory and celebrates the progress to the European Championship.
Due to the precise defense of the Czech team, the Chernohorci came under pressure until the second half.
The wrestlers of the match became Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x8D>, who burned two great chances.
Even thanks to the great Petra <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and the prize of some 200 million crowns is added to the cash of domestic football.
A lot of fighting football has been played since the opening minutes.
Both teams struggled to get involved in the combination and played mostly around half the line.
The pressure of domestic footballers did not come even in the first half, as long drafts for defense were accurately rejected by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred college students have created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program before a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday, students prayed in front of the facility and then provoked the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students from Iran’s Isfahan University on Tuesday created a living shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, where uranium is being processed.
They show that they are ready to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in its recent report that Iran had not stopped seeking a nuclear weapon.
A possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is being discussed in Israel.
The students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then provoked the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at protecting Iran's nuclear program as much as possible, according to the Israeli press, in addition to the Isfahan Center, a facility in Natanz, where uranium is enriched, would also be the target.
The diet of an obese child: does not eat breakfast and dinner of oats
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight, with an excess weight of 9% of schoolchildren and 5% of obese children.
Obese children, on the other hand, mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey showed.
Again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment in which it grows, and the patterns it is surrounded by.
On tables in obese children, for example, sneezing occurs up to half as often as in families of children with normal weight.
The curds had to be eaten the day before the research related to an awareness event called Obesity is no coincidence more than 19 percent of obese people.
In families of obese people, too, it is not a habit to exercise, which, of course, applies to most families of today’s schoolchildren – only 15 percent of children answered that their parents would find time for active movement at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last school year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the Obesity event not a coincidence that supports the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 students from 4th to 8th grade have participated in the project.
Proper nutrition and plenty of movement in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children.
“Only half of the respondents, for example, indicated that she had five times a day in the breakfast-dinner-dinner-dinner-dinner-dinner regimen, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition,” reads one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and night out
Experts point out that there are important and relative details for healthy development, including the regular time of family breakfasts.
In the Czech Republic, at the same time, only 23 percent of the families of schoolchildren have breakfast.
In most families, everyone has their own breakfast.
And the worst part was finding that in a dozen households you don’t have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily meal.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, unhealthy rodents are consumed much more often.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
While it regularly sports more than 40 percent of the children surveyed, the result was less than half - 15 percent among their parents.
Build your own dining room
The next part of the survey allowed the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compose their own dining room according to their own taste and opinion.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite foods are a lot of mouthfuls, solids and sweets.
"The alarming thing is especially the great taste of sweet lemonade," the study's final report said.
For lunch as the main meal, the pasta was won just above the poultry.
But the children practically did not want shellfish at all, and the taste of fish and afternoon vegetable dishes is also low.
Adherence to Health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they get the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the Obesity lecture, there is no coincidence that in a number of cases there has been a significant shift of preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the results of the project show.
For example, this was the case with sweet lemonades, where more children would start to prefer plain water.
Also, children were much more often included in the questionnaires of poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and would limit sweet foods and dumplings.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, says the professional
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I complained so little that there was a lot of that already in the introductory hours.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, dressing problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes on the pitch.
And it'll be worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it is really "wrong".
This time we discussed with director Alenka (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly proportional figure.
And the vast majority of them.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boy figure with no regular curves, and someone is overweight again.
The stylist must know how to visually soften the wide shoulders, extend the neck or add the necessary curves.
We got tips as well as for a woman like Jennifer Lopez, that is, bigger breasts and hips and tight waist, to emphasize the figure well and at the same time not to dress a woman too provocatively.
For example, if the difference between the belt and the sides is such that the skirts or pants do not really sit, then it is worth letting yourself wear at least one such piece to the measure.
You will definitely not regret it, because the perfect falling clothes is not to be paid.
In a tailored dress you will feel much better than in one that moves you constantly, hugs you, stays in the belt and so on.
The boy figure can again allow himself to wear clothes with squeezing, applications, embroidery or picking up.
Of course, there are many such information and types of characters, so I’m glad I’ve got a whole week to sort out all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid that, given the homework assignment, it's just that.
Each of the courses has been assigned to a celebrity, who has to invent two outfits: day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of a given personality and the type of character.
I'm going to "clothe" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In the spirit of cheering, for me personally definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained maybe a hundred pounds (take, please, in the question of overcrowding), or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or search the internet and print and then process them graphically.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, will then also express our personal style and relationship to graphic rendering.
It is also important to think about the graphic page of styling.
The stylist not only dresses physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific tasks, such as trends of bags, jackets, etc.).
This was told by stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k.
But it's not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday’s lecture, loaded with information about the types of characters, was immediately distributed by three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should be able to use it.
And a stylish stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
Variability is key in this case.
For example, such a trench coat (or if you want to originally trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and t-shirts as a cloak, but you can also dress it on a bare body, wrap the boats and photograph as a dress.
Or it's enough to play gloves or cuffs and immediately the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he said.
However, I appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly at work."
"Then you can start to break them," Jacob said.
Finally, I understand why we are spoiling all the lessons, what to combine with, why, when we see something different in fashion magazines leaky.
Not to mention the sightings.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that the stylist must have prepared much more clothing options than how many of them he goes to photograph.
So for a fashion story that will have ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be ready to "fix" at least fifteen.
And also that on the photo of the clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces of lace completely different than in fact.
So we have to take that into account when creating the outfit.
That the image and style makes the leaks up to half the success, confirmed Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miracle singer, but image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, access to the services of stylists is rather cold.
Even familiar faces are considered to be unnecessary (it's enough that I can do something, the way I look at it is secondary).
And if someone from us already lets us create styling, then we have to reckon with the fact that it most likely dictates to us a completely different (smaller) size than it really does.
Then it is only necessary to google and find out if the boulevard did not mention that the celebrity in question was sneezing/sneezing and so on.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario told us that it is not enough for the stylist to focus on fashion and the ability to put on the outfit.
In her work, she mainly communicates with people who dress, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to challenge yourself, to stand up for your opinion.
"If a manager orders you to tear up her closet and fill it up with nice pieces, then you can't throw out the whole closet and say, 'Oh, my God, that's awful.'
“Find at least a few things out there that you’ll praise and recommend what you can wear,” says Mario.
He also showed us in particular what everything must contain the so-called "shelf", or bag for the square.
It is the one that you turn on around the belt and have all the necessary properties with you.
In addition to bright things such as scissors, hair rollers or closing pins, there are also silicone threads (with it the stylist helps to take photos of products such as bags or hats), special clips, which we sew behind the clothes, if the pins are bigger (if the pins are bigger),
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to properly put on shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where there is a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, i.e. outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch our shoes with scissors so that they don't get damaged by accident.
There is a real need for skill.
Mario made me happy when he praised my creation without exception.
The aforementioned skill is not really my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we've heard about the second weekend of the course.
It’s becoming increasingly clear to me that it’s really not a walk in a pink suit, no matter who wants what they want.
In Need for Speed: The Run, you can race across America.
Testimonials
Originally a carefree ride, due to a series of completely unnecessary slippage errors, turns into a routine morning ride on the sledgehammer.
The ambition has been met to a great extent, but it is not worth it when no one seems to want to do anything extra.
A new work titled The Run built high expectations before the release.
He promised that by flying the racing series Need for Speed he would again move a bit in a new direction and from playable shows appeared as a game that in the genre of action racing should not be just in numbers.
We were also curious as to how the inserted passages will hit, in which the main hero will get out of the car and run his way.
But as with the NFS series, a lot of it is a little different than we expected.
They are potentially decent arcade racing, but the whole thing pulls down a few unnecessary mistakes that have appeared in the series more or less over the years.
So it's actually not a mistake, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are featured in a story whose main character Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution offers to participate in an illegal race across America.
Behind the wheel you sit on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to arrive first in New York.
The idea carries with it a number of interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then more than fifty races.
As a result, each race runs on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
It doesn’t feel like the game is always the same.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing universal.
But riding across the desert, in the autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains is visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are occasionally sprayed with some non-typical element.
In the desert, for example, you get stuck in a sandstorm, which greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you need to be careful not to fall asleep avalanche.
In addition, individual races are set up quite well behind each other.
There are only a few types, but that is enough.
For a moment you try to pass the required number of opponents (essentially a classic race), then you get time again (classic fight with the tracks) and then you need a duel with a single opponent.
In addition, from time to time, you will also get involved with the police, which further upsets all your efforts.
There are new passages outside the car.
Rather, it’s just an interactive animation where Jack usually flies in front of someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right times.
Nothing complicated.
However, it will come as a surprise that these passages are in the game much less than you would expect (in particular, maybe even just three).
As a result, however, this is for the benefit of the thing, because this element does not have a chance to become annoying and in the context of the above, it thus ranks among the elements that spoil the game.
The riding model follows in the footsteps of previous parts.
That means it’s definitely not a lot of people these days, but it can’t be said that it would be an opposition.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the more accurately conceived race here, the riding model still fits quite well, even though we would be able to find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in perfect order.
But the problems begin to arise after a while.
In contrast to the driving model, the model is no longer very good.
From a game of this type, we do not expect that it counts complex deformations and collisions, but if you have no idea how your car is maintained before practically any impact on any object, then it is probably not all right.
Typically, when driving in close traffic or driving a car in normal traffic, you’ll sometimes just lick each other slightly, but sometimes in an almost identical situation, your car will end up in wild pirouettes.
Or even just think about it.
Thanks to the restart system, it does not matter at all, but it will make you feel more comfortable.
Restarts are arranged so that if you break up or go far off the track, the game throws you back to the last catch point on the track.
However, there are only five restarts available in each race.
When you run out of them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it’s more of a tool in case something goes wrong than you could rely on it explicitly.
Sometimes, however, even restarts will not help, it will solve them until the need to learn to remember a given section of the race.
The big downside of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, require a project in a specific way, otherwise you will not get into them briefly.
Other times, you will meet the "civil" cars at a given location always in the same configuration, whether you come there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see a competitor passing easily between two opposing cars in front of you, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive or brake them.
It doesn’t matter when you get to them, because it’s “calculated” so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Competitors also have another advantage.
Throughout the game you will encounter several places where you, again, no matter the time, will always precede the same opponent in the same place.
Most of all, it pigs at the end of the game on the long bridge, where you go in the opposite direction.
The opponent must get there in front of you, apparently, at any cost.
When it goes in front of you, it makes you worse at the overview of the opposing cars, so you get a good massage there a couple of times in the beginning.
You may understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-fueled, but the implementation is so obvious that it will reliably dissipate you quickly.
And it’s a shame, because despite the simple riding model is playing fun and places even so action that sometimes you literally can’t keep track of where it’s flying.
And it really doesn’t matter whether it deserves a concept with fifty unique tracks, ranking races so that boredom doesn’t have a chance, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to exchange cars during races.
You need to pay attention to the petrol pumps on the road, because there you can change the car, although in most cases you’ll get enough of what you just have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Athletes are suitable for urban areas, strong American storms on straight highways and exotic supersports on technical rides, for example on clicked mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand and challenge mode, which are races in the individual locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points to your profile, which is common for challenges and story.
To obtain a higher level of driver, different objects are unlocked: starting cars and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
At the same time, it is again connected to the online Autolog feature, which among other things compares your achieved results with other players and provides other community features.
One of the other hard-to-understand puzzles is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you can get to the metro tunnel (Budzh), where you will marry in the dark by rail (Budzh).
On the tachometer you can see numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (Budzh) and in the back there is a set of meters and uncompromisingly upset you.
In the editorial board, we will probably have a few more days to discuss whether no one really thought a bit when creating the game, or whether the authors have us as such a big idiot.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It freezes so that in some quieter moments, the shooting decreases, and in some cases, quite tragically.
However, this is especially the case with a larger number of participants, when you no longer have anything to do with the smooth shooting.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an attempt to please the widest possible range of the younger audience, a soundtrack of the category "every dog is different all" was created, but it can be assumed that because of listening to music, probably no one will buy the game.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is very disappointing.
If the game were to make absolutely unnecessary mistakes, then we wouldn’t be afraid to say that The Run is the best piece of NFS in the last few years.
But that’s how the game works.
The fun is definitely great, but be prepared to make sure that your mistakes will be shaken in the eyes by the power of airport spotlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vice-President:
Czechs have a reputation for negativity and Euroscepticism
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly disrupted the balance between the individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five or six years for the situation to settle down a bit, calm down and for all players to get used to their new role," said Milena Vicen<0xC3><0xA1>, a Czech Ambassador to the European Union.
As far as her motto "Understanding and open about Europe" is taken seriously, she showed already in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the individual EU bodies and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that a number of lecturers could lecture her.
Vicen<0xC3><0xA1> also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, there was criticism that it was inconceivable that he was a gray official, that he couldn't play any role, and I have to say that everyone was breathing out that role, that he was doing well."
"He is a person who can listen to the twenty-seven Member States, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question: "Who is this European Union? What phone number should I call?", i.e. as a significant step towards unification and greater readability of EU policy towards states.
No one wants to ban us cheesecakes.
The Vice-President also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council has lived, lived and will live on in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of the Predlo<0xC5><0x88>sk<0xC3><0xA1> declared it a success.
The Czechs solved the emerging financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time then marked a great negativity, which severely damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, the "fact of the frmol" was not only the presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that is being resolved to this day.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union has yet to be approved, which is very complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be slim and cost-effective, which sectors will receive priority, which countries will be supported more and which less, all of this is on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "About Europe understandable".
"I really don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, a haunting that no one understands.
How is a citizen supposed to understand that in Brussels there really are no curdled or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that we really need to be banned from cheesecakes.”
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
Multi-speed Europe is waiting for us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation of Eurosceptics and people who pay attention to the negative rather than the positive side of things.
In addition, she regrets the low representation of the Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, there are many factors at fault, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also raised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, if Poland and Hungary come after me and the Slovak comes close, the Frenchman next to me will say, 'Hey, what are you meeting there, what are your Visegrad four?' and he's not excited about it at all."
In the future, according to Vice-Presidents, the Union is mainly waiting for new tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As a very real concept, he then perceives the concept of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, rather than a new "European federation."
“We have a country in the euro area and a country outside the euro area.”
"We have a Schengen area, we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time, it was said that only countries that wanted to cooperate and those that didn’t want to stay away should cooperate.”
"There will be more of these institutes and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicen<0xC3><0xA1> said.
In this regard, it also assessed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in implementing the principle that all issues affecting the Union should be discussed between all Member States, not just between the euro area countries.

IBM Innovator Begins Second Century of Its Existence
If someone were to look for the word that most accurately expresses IBM’s strategy, the closest would probably be “long-term.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is perceived as a very contemporary company, and yet it has been a hundred years since it was founded.
The foundation of this longevity was laid by the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already made the slogan that a number of world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" became the imprint around which the life of the future giant would take place (and also the name of the internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson’s carefully built corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means continuing to move towards the future.
IBM survived and thrived for a hundred years because it remained true to its core values and was not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that we will achieve even more in the second century,” Samuel J. Palmisano, the current CEO of the company, said on the anniversary.
Developed system
Watson, in his thirties, took care of his employees in the same way as the entrepreneur Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM had as one of the first U.S. employees paid leave, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee's uniform and a sophisticated system to pay the best off.
IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer as well.
The company has been brilliant at attracting talent from the start – as one of the world’s first companies, it has eliminated any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana, headed by IBM, will replace a woman next year - Virginia Rometty.
IBM has been in business for thirty years, and still holds the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called online brainstorming pits, from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
No wonder there are enough ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
An institution with a good name
A firm position in the business ensures that the company has a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technology company,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a Harvard Business School professor and author of the book.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, the difference between entering the market and creating the market directly.
IBM - or "Big Blue", as it's familiarly named because of its logo in the United States - has grown into one of the world's largest companies for a hundred years.
It is arguably the most versatile technology company – it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
He holds the most patents from all U.S. tech companies, and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include a ATM, a payment card, a financial swap, a barcode or a diskette.
With approximately $220 billion, IBM has become the second-largest technology company by market capitalization (the first being Apple), when it surpassed Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Front view
Not all products and innovations are customer-driven and time-consuming - for example, IBM failed to place a bet on its own OS/2 operating system, online Prodigy service or IBM PCjr.
“If your business is built on moving forward, you can’t emotionally relate to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM doesn’t have a problem building its foundations on many platforms – and if they don’t work, then leave them.
Unlike a competitive Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Prospective technology
In IBM’s markets, services are the largest, with about a fifth of them made up of software and hardware.
Back in 1990, he was the most powerful hardware player with more than half the share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold few profitable assets worth $15 billion, during which time it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the world’s modern financial crisis was overtaken for the first time.
IBM is acting according to a reference to its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased the volume of investment during a major economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is going through the current crisis unscathed.
IBM’s share price has increased by 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, with the company’s net profit continuously increasing.
IBM’s corporate password is to change everything, but not its values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant will manage it.
IBM's History: From Short Cheeses to Flights to Space
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago and was originally known as the Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
IBM took over the name in 1924 - it was originally a brand used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later IBM gave a merger of four companies, the history of which dates back to the 1980s.
They owned technologies such as the famous "pickers", i.e. hours recording the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the company's supervisory board until 1930.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the head of a rival company, to help him run the company.
The leader then shaded the founders of IBM – Watson’s ideas have yet to build an invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of machines for business – from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson headed the company, it doubled its turnover to $9 million and began a large expansion of the company to all parts of the world.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior, after almost forty years in the chief executive chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA fly into space—on Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, the famous Man-to-Moon flight.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "puzzle" that set the computer standard of the time, called the IBM 5150, came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the contrary, bought the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote itself fully to high value-added consulting and services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to make smart use of technologies in previously unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example, in transport or city administration.
IBM recently introduced the “Smarter Commerce” platform for the business sector, which helps traders manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the country.
She founded her branch in Czechoslovakia at the time in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM <0xC4><0x8C>R, it also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.
Rhythm of an unfaithful husband:
Yes, I do. I don't want him anymore.
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) said the end!
After her husband Joseph Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now she has to wait for the unwanted and has set clear rules for her next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> explained.
When Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> provided asylum to Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> in her home in the summer, she apparently didn’t even know how her marriage would end.
Although Iveta moved out of <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>an after 30 days in her haste, Pepa did not abandon the singer.
He even admitted publicly that he loved her.
As time went on, Darin resigned, and her husband’s relationship was almost reconciled, and now she even said goodbye to him forever.
The barber doesn’t care who his wife sleeps with.
If the Rycht<0xC3><0xA1>r broke up with Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov just once, his wife’s open arms wouldn’t wait for him at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live his life in our common home, no one will drive him out."
"But he will experience it not as my beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said, as she had already separated from her husband and insisted only on mutual courtesy.
The fact that Darin closed the back door to Joseph doesn't bother him yet.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm with Iveta and I'm not going to change that."
"The wife has set up a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, the garden, the property, I buy."
“We’re talking to Darin quite normally, just because we don’t share the beds together,” said Blesku Rycht<0xC3><0xA1>r.
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> had found a new love, she wouldn’t have stopped it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where she goes, who she goes with, and if she has a friend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and take full responsibility,” Josef concluded.
The Worst Women's Crimes: Are They Affecting You?
When you ask men if they could name some typical female abuses, usually all in one is very readily sucked out of the sleeve.
Dear women, will you meet in the following lines, where are there several female abuses that can perfectly pump blood into the veins of men?
Shopping
Does your other half charge you that you're addicted to shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one mattress per week?
Do you like to shop and collect in discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about shopping as a habit.
Some women realize that they should at least have a bit of a crush on their shopping passion.
But tell me, who would resist it just so walk around the clothes shops, look for well-fitting tops and then try them all (ideally in different color versions) in the cabin?
Although for most women shopping is a stop, for men it can become literally a finished hell.
Just remember how many times you've told yours to wait for you before you go in...
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Don’t these words remind you of something?
Yeah, right?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
Stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of this complaint increases, the more annoying women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless walk.
Wash windows, dry out, wipe the tiles, wipe the dust, rub the bath - at least twice a week.
Are you charging your partner that he stepped dirty feet on a clean tile, kids that they rubbed the cracked sink and plastered the glassed living wall with which you gave yourself so much work?
In the event that you suffer from this "relief", try to realize that nothing is to be overcome and order and cleanliness should definitely not stand in the first place within the family.
This harmless desire for purity can jeopardise your relationships and family well-being.
Squeezing
"Put the used trainers in the basket."
"Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"The wet wipe doesn't belong on the ground."
If you yell at your partner like this several times a day, know that you can turn him out reliably.
Of course, you don’t think that’s wrong, you want to make sure everything is okay.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn't have to fuck them so much again...
Concussion, squeezing
For some women, there are also rumors, gossip, but also insults and socializing against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, and so together they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us will throw a little harmless drab or a sneeze in there.
Hands on the heart, it's all women's.
On the other hand, they are the tiniest grain that they like and often grind, perhaps they envy everyone, and are particularly dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the framework of the women's working collective.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr and Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek helped to win Philadelphia
Hockey striker Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr took part in Monday’s NHL game with two assists for the Philadelphia 5:3 win on the Carolina ice and is once again at the head of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux took advantage of the nineteen-year-old star’s overview, which added another record and was named the best player in the match.
Two assists in the match were also recorded by J<0xC3><0xA1>gr<0xC3><0xB3>’s co-player Jakub Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the match, the game claimed to the overseas journalists that Giroux was predicting a big evening.
"Before the game, I told him he'd give me a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you'll feel that way," explained Jagr, after whose action Giroux gave the first Flyers a goal.
A moment later, the second intervention of the team also had a Czech track.
Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek fought behind the Hurricanes' gate and presented it to Maxim Talbot in the rounds.
The second before the first break was reduced in weakening home player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
After working with J<0xC3><0xA1>gre, he shot a third goal, then overtook his shot in the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," said J<0xC3><0xA1>gr.
"I never would have thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him."
"I'm happy about that."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL my teammates tried to play me, now it's turning around," added Jagr.
Carolina made a drama from the match, Tuoma Ruutua's goal, and again Dwyer, who jumped out of the penalty shootout, got into a different goal.
However, another complication was not allowed by Matt Read, who ended up renumbering two to one.
"He's a great fit in our Pronger range."
"The disc went off, I picked up the speed and [Read] went to a more distant pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek described the last goal of the match from his point of view.
With the victory, Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not play a match against Buffalo, in the second third he resigned due to injuries in the upper part of the body.
The Candiens, in addition to the experienced batsman, lost the two-branch lead and lost after a 2:3 penalty shootout.
One of their raids did not change Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec.
The home coach, rather than the lost points, hated the vast marmot of the back row, with the match being played by only five defenders.
"It's bad."
"We played the hideout with only one experienced player, the rest were youths."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"The exchange for the exchange was good for us and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game more, move the puck out of our range."
We had gaps in that," added one of P.K. Subban's defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed thirty Winnipeg interventions to a 5:2 win over Tampou Bay.
Five different shooters shared the Jets' goals, which interrupted the five-point series of breakthroughs.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel offices were allowed in Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time were mostly only selling trips to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled on holiday to the sea to the NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on Crimea near the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime acceded to the West and the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia was subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel individually even within socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or to the Soviet Union, then he needed a letter of summons from this country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered tours to the West, but it was necessary to stand out from the front overnight with a sleeper or to have "good friends" in the travel office.
However, it was not won either.
The so-called currency pledge, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a currency pledge it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) on the way to the West.
However, by far the Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country, which resulted in a large number of chats and chalets that the Czechs acquired and this habit survives to this day.
Since 1989, the Czech Republic has been experiencing a real revolution.
While until 1989, holidays in the NDR or Bulgaria were our top priority, the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations abroad in countries around the world.
The huge paradox that we are no longer aware of today is that it was not possible for us to travel freely to the most popular Croatia until 1989, as it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
As early as the late 1990s, visa obligations to neighbouring Western European countries were lifted, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria, Vienna or Germany.
The Czechs could not afford to travel to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czechs’ trips to parks burned in tents, as our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a pension.
A typical feature of travelling the Czechs during this time was to drive their own food, canned food, salads, etc., to be saved.
Another important moment was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown, which allowed our tourists to finally freely buy Western currency after many decades.
However, our standard of living and with it average wages have increased, which led to another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have started to regularly prepare charter flights since 1997, which has led to an incredible reduction in air travel, thanks to the possibility of contracting numerous discounts compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs had visa-free access to virtually all the developed countries of the world, except the United States, which made it easier for us to travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred in the year 2000, when, thanks to considerable demand, the first direct charter flight into exoticism was sent from the Czech Republic, it was to Thailand.
From this year onwards, Czech tourists fly direct charters to warm distant countries, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting around 100,000 Czechs per year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. revoked a visa for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) for the first time in history and spent more than CZK 15 thousand per person for one holiday abroad, including on-site costs.
The General Assembly is to find the President, but he is in danger again.
Almost five months is Czech football without a president and there is a threat that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be known for another extraordinary rally, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburka.
There is still no agreement as to which electoral order will be conducted.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
The interests of leading Czech football are Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
Hashek resigned from the position in June and while leaving, he urged colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
However, in the post-Ha<0xC5><0xA1>kov era, football slipped back into the gaps between the two chambers of alliance, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16, when a new president was to be elected.
Delegates of the general assembly sat in the National House in Prague in Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov unnecessarily, as the negotiations remained blocked and were not just about the way the elections were held.
There was also no consensus as to who had the right to vote in the assembly - whether only statutory representatives or officials of the mandate were in full power.
At this single point, there has been a partial agreement since then, which was also helped by the recommendations of the Institute for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
However, there are still disputes over the electoral system.
The situation was not too clear, nor did the executive committee, which, in its negotiations, whether proper or extraordinary, essentially does not solve anything else.
The view of the option has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to exclude the possibility of a kick?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or to find another model," said Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FACSR, who represents professional football under the leadership of the association.
According to the provisions of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate will win, which will have greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
We must be willing to resign in order to win a candidate who will get a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side is pushing for the condition that the winner must gain at least a two-thirds advantage in this percentage calculation.
"If that were to leave the meaning of the two previous rounds, it would completely deny the two-chamber concept," he understands the objections of the Moravian party Svoboda, according to which the best order would be to not move and vote according to the valid statutes.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the electoral order determined by the statutes is most suitable for Pelt from all the candidates.
"I wish to be elected as far as possible according to the statutes."
"Not to make any sort of representational nonsense like at the last general election," said owner Viktorie Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who is running for the first time and in his remarks was mainly against Pelt.
Pelta remains an optimist.
According to him, the new president will be known and believes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"Everyone will be passionately reassured by today's possible national team procedure for the European Championship."
“Football will again be on a happy wave, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate,” says an Apple employee who has the greatest experience of managing football on a professional as well as regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope the deal is in place, but unfortunately the situation is very dilapidated."
“It’s not between the people of the Czech Republic and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations purposefully.”
"This can cause the rolling stock to be blocked again."
"I hope, however, that common sense will prevail," Reichl said.
There is not much time left for the agreement of all parties.
Some of the negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete in the match.
The aviation special, in which they were to travel to Podgorica, among other things the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>er and Rajchl, did not fly from Prague in the morning due to a technical breakdown and was looking for a replacement option, as part of the executive committee to the history of the barrage of transport.
Finally, there may be a crucial meeting at the ministerial level, which is likely to take place on Wednesday.
Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would like to bring the dispersed parties within the country’s strongest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot in the game: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming <0xC4><0x8C>STV rally, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
The boy goes to the fight for the president because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If the head of footballers Plzn<0xC4><0x9B> Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k had seen a strong candidate before an extraordinary election, he would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), nor would he have applied for a top position in the fight.
"If there is a high-quality adept, I fight for him and I don't go to the polls."
"But in the current situation, no one has been able to find such a thing," said <0xC4><0x8C>TK Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
In a fight with Miroslav Peltou and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Reichl, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k is motivated to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favourite of the election, on his way to the head of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Pakl<0xC3><0xAD>k also points out that in the event of his victory, he would only last as president until 2013, when there is a regular general assembly on the agenda.
In the feature, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not too connected with football events.
"I've been talking to some people who would consider it."
“It was crazy for me when some people said they don’t even want to identify with Czech football at the moment.”
"I'd like to change that view," he said.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k says Pelt’s relationship with the president of the Plze<0xC5><0x88> Regional Football Association, Roman Berbrem, a man with a controversial reputation who is known in the background as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the vote of delegates at the polls.
For Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, it is so unacceptable that Pelta is in the presidential position.
"If he had won, the current state would be preserved and nothing would have moved forward in football."
"In combination with Berbra's support, which is a capable trader, it would not benefit football even more," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
He also points out that Pelt’s name was mentioned years ago in the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelt left without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And what we would also look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who is also taking a look at his former statement that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became president."
But if Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k triumphed in the Thursday election, he would be able to imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another Reichl candidate, supported by Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k before the September election, who ended in failure, is also considering.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go after."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him as the head of the team."
"But he couldn't manage the association managerially."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who in September drew great attention by standing behind the appeal of the jury led by Ludek Macel, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The guy says he'd trust the management of the association.
He draws on his ability to run private companies, and since last summer he has also been the head of Pilsen, which, with his support, celebrated the Premier League triumph in May.
“I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment in order to contribute to its particular cultivation.”
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups, which may have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and recall committee, which goes all the way down to unpleasant situations," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who did not hide his antipathy to, for example, Spartan boss Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nski.
One of the priorities would also be the tightening of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R’s relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby for more money from the lottery tax to enter the sport at political peaks.
"It's one of the key things that the new president should be doing."
“If there is a risk tax, as the political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they have to tell the level where the money is going,” he said.
As a burden now, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k does not even take his affiliation with the Pilsen club, although he himself claims that the president of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be "superlateral".
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec, Reichl with the Prague Ducla.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any sense in translating my shares into someone covertly at the Pilsen club and in a year and a half he went back there," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R statutes that would rule out the election bed
Two days before the election of the football association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that in the event of an election, the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would have new provisions that would definitively rule out disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic before Thursday’s Nymburc meeting and believes that the pre-election fight will significantly detract from today’s eventual success of the football team.
Pelta has already promised, before the September election, that it is the representation and acquisition of funds that he intends to focus on in the event of an election.
He decided to go to the last minute before the election before the last election, so a two-month delay could be enough to defend his idea of running football and introduce it in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect to know the president on Thursday."
“It feels like it’s high time someone led the association,” says the man, who is primarily associated with the Apple Club but has worked for a number of years at Sparta and the executive committee of the alliance.
That is why he thinks he has enough experience to be able to run Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
"Unfortunately, at the June general assembly, the statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they didn't allow different interpretations, we've had the president since September," Pelta said.
It was the reworking of the most important document of the civil society that brought together the delegates.
"If I become president, I'll take it as a personal task and I'm willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn't work out."
"It's a principled thing we can't be without," Pelta says.
He also says he is trying not to stand up to his opponents.
He had previously warned that he could imagine working with Jindrich Reichl, whom he recognized for his legal education, and he knew well that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
For a long time he did not attack Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who, on the contrary, left a thread dry on Pelt.
"There's something going on in football over a year, it's already got some success."
"But his attacks were unworthy, and many people jumped in the way of the election campaign."
"And that's why a number of them are now questioning his true character," he said to the opponent's address, Pelt, who said he remains faithful to the proclamation he announced in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the representation.
It should be an interpretation of football.
"And I would also try to end all the affair starting with the Bohemians' case or the rumors of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would then rush to negotiate with both the private and state sectors to secure enough money for the whole of football," said a six-and-a-half-year-old candidate.
At the time, he also promised that his arrival at the head of football would not mean any personal purges.
"I would have to get to know the full number of individual employees first," he said, referring to Strahov, where for a long time there was understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming assembly, he believes that on Thursday, delegates will not go to Nymburk unnecessarily.
"If the only point of contention is how he's going to vote in the third round, we can get through it."
"Football needs credibility, and it's the only way he'll finally get his leader back," Pelta said, two days before a potentially decisive day in his career.
Rajchl promises that under him FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would start working hard
If former Vice-President Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl had been elected as the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Thursday General Assembly, many people in the association would not be pleased.
In fact, Reichl promises that in the event of his election, he will start working hard.
It wants to implement systemic changes and make members of the executive committee responsible for the individual football fields.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by former President Ivan Hasek.
"As president, I would like to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football after youth," he said.
"But I'm not saying I'd do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
"I'm a team player and I want to divide competences in the executive committee so that each of the members is dedicated to a specific area."
"And I'm going to give a hard task to move football a mile ahead in each of these segments."
“A lot of people wouldn’t be happy because they would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he would not run again.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it's going to make sense and that I won't have people behind me who are going to keep knocking at my feet and questioning every step of my life," he said.
"A lot of people told me I can't give it up, because then others would give it up."
"That's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He says he is motivated by continuing the work he started with Haskem.
"There's been a lot of work done in those two years, and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There have been initiated processes that will have a lesson in just a few years, and I don't want anyone to stop them," he said, fearing that in the event of the election of another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation at the union could return to the time before Hashem.
"I believe in systematism, and that's something Mirek Pelt doesn't think he can do."
"There are people behind him who would make football so that he would be only for those chosen."
"I can count a lot of things, but it's certainly not that I'm going to side with someone."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football for everyone, because then everybody will be fine, not just the election," Rajchl said.
He also denies the claim that he was only the Czech president.
"Even though some people are trying to say the opposite, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to consider that the second league would be divided into Czech and Moravian, whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would not be a current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Reichl said.
Since the head of the Plzen club Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also took part in the fight for the president, he does not dare to estimate his chances of election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its vice-president and sees that there are clear successes behind me," said Reichl, who considers his successes to be saving tens of millions of crowns on unfavorable contracts, deals on counter-television.
On the contrary, it is assumed that the union does not pull for a single rope.
While he claims about Peltov that he is "disqualified from returning confidence to Czech football", the second of Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k's rivals considers him a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen during that year."
“If he were elected, he would probably continue in the things that Ivan Hasek started here and would not change the staffing of the committees in any way.”
"He wouldn't want to screw it up in his favor," says rival Reichl.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jumping to the blue
Julia Stanek
From Ufon’s point of view, Budapest’s overcrowded swimming pool: Those who travel Europe can experience their blue wonder – and after exploring cities or traveling let their tired feet rest in thermal spas.
The book will show you where the wellness at the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder appeared in the past one and a half years on the open road, she was not to be missed in her luggage: her swimsuits.
Laying a sign on the water, looking up to the height of the artfully formed domes, she floated opposite the marble pits (the buildings of a small naked boy, a child (with wings)) who were waiting for her on the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restored secessional pond.
If she liked any waterworks, she took it to her notebook in a bubble - even with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of it.
More than 200 paving sites have been explored in this way by the historical architect of Meder architecture and presents them now in his recently published book "Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing) ": People's paving sites in Munich, the historic paving palace in Schwarzwald.
In 13 countries, she was guided by her "The Way to the Most Extraordinary Spas in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited localities in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg.
46-year-old Germany is a true enthusiast of the pluvaren culture.
With sport it is not too much, says Meder - only in water it is something else.
The only thing to be angry about is that fan swimming has to satisfy with blue cockroaches and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can inhale the ominous smell of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful bird whispering in the park.
"One day I asked myself why the shipyards must always be so shitty," says Ms. Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice floats."
Water level doubles the architecture
Exploding in the Scottish pool and essential oils for the sauna - a factor of comfort is therefore so great that it affects all senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, the floats could be a real eye-catcher: "Instead of the floor, there's a man in the spa water level."
"However, it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: a high vault, a wide heel, a jumping board.
The small-format picture booklet "Badefreuden (The joys of swimming)" provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical wellnes - but above all it stimulates the desire to jump into the blue.
A remarkable specimen was discovered by the collector of Mrs. Meder's floats during her search in Hungary.
In addition to beautiful healing spas, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi spa in Budapest, she found water with nitrogen content in the original karst cave (the cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal spas, the pools of which are filled with alkaline water and are made of boiling water.
On the other hand, there are many heated swimming pools under the wide sky in Switzerland and Austria. While one has from the Curonian Spit swimming pool on the eyes of the whole city, one can look at the outdoor swimming pool in St. Anton and the pond is covered with sluice.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits the spa guests in L<0xC3><0xA4>ngenfeld: Akvapark <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
Out of the three open pelvis in winter, a steam rises while in the background of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal mountain winds to the sky.
Alhambra and Schwarzwald
Not in every swimming pool did Mrs. Meder's pool collector get the smell of chlorine in his groin.
Many thermal spas are feeling bitter, in the spas of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d in Békescsab<0xC3><0xA1> in Hungary it smells of hot oil to the extent that one hardly believes he has gotten into the therapeutic spas.
The smell comes from healing water with the content of alkaline hydrogen carbonates, which is almost black and whose sediments are palpable on the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a somewhat special wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for nice spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate spa Luha<0xC4><0x8D>ovice, she came across a closed field.
In 1902, the spa designed by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic was closed.
As Mrs. Meder looked out through the crumbling windows of the red-and-white-yellow sectional building, she saw the vastly growing weeds between the tiles.
On the other hand, the fairy tale was set in a magical swimming pool in Schwarzwald: in the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas already have three phases of construction behind them; one can discover not only the neo-Romanesque elements that date back to their origins in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the style of Alhambra, which was connected around 1900.
Since its careful modernisation in 1995, Palais Thermal has been a favorite spa spot for swimming pools expert Mrs. Iris Meder, not only because it comes from Schwarzwald.
“It’s already some kind of performance, combining such diverse building styles into such a beautiful complex,” says Ms. Meder.
At such a palace, immersion in the thermal pool is apparently a border issue.
Agrarian Speculation
Deutsche Bank to Invest in Commodity Trading
Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank leaving its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned the working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
In January, the company’s CEO wants to make a difference.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For federal citizens, the thing is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable, according to one study, for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions step out of this trade because the problems of the world’s poorest are deepening.
This is the result of Forsa’s poll commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges drive prices to a high level and therefore banks are complicit in the world’s hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is aimed specifically at Deutsche Bank boss Josef Ackermann, although big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley also act similarly.
Commodity bets were originally intended to insure traders against price fluctuations in the market.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that capital market participants with an interest in high-risk trades withdrew from supply and demand – and at the expense of the poorest, they achieved profits.
Unlike competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann’s criticism: he promised to check the withdrawals and said that no trade “doesn’t stand for Deutsche Bank’s good reputation to be placed in the bet.”
According to the information SPIEGEL ONLINE controls the international working group on extracts from the Foodwatch-Report.
By the end of the year, the check will be closed, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Board - along with a recommendation on how to load it.
At the end of January, the bank’s representatives want to know what the consequences will be.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann is working self-help on his image.
Thilo Bode, head of Foodwatch, welcomed the report, but at the same time reinforced his criticism of the financial sector: “Sitting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how ruthlessly the bank is hurting the general welfare today.”
Let Ackermann be the highest bank lobbyist in the world.
“Deutsche Bank has to cut out of its portfolio all items where money is used for betting on food prices,” Bode said.
"It's a question of whether Mr. Ackermann is hungry for people suffering or of the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s outlook seems surprising at first glance, but it’s clear that the CEO would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before leaving the office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board, other than planned, would not go to the supervisory board.
By turning away from the controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about possible losses - he should eventually deal with his successor.
Each of them would invest in raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Forsa Institute questioned 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
According to this, 11 percent of Deutsche Bank considers it legitimate that it offers investments with which bets on food prices are linked.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: each of them would account for all the investments in which the money flows into speculation with the raw materials as a result of the survey.
43 per cent would warn a known bank before such a bank, 49 per cent said they were thinking about cancelling their account and moving on to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
The Relocated Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won awards, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and abandoned.
It is now reopened as an exhibition hall.
When climbing for modern post-war architecture, for bright shapes, glass halls, bold spans and new building materials that are typical of faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer is for the Brussels World Exposition 1958.
Schwanzer's pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight, high-performance steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered to be the cornerstone of modern architecture.
He celebrated the architect so that he also built the pavilion of Austria during the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-wheel-drive BMW plus as the key made by a side building in Munich, it became internationally famous at the end of 1973.
As a temporary exhibition building, the pavilion designed after the world exhibition was placed in the Schweizer Garten near the Vienna S<0xC3><0xBC>dbahnhof (South Station), reconstructed and in 1962 opened the Museum of the 20th century - it was named "House of the 20th Century".
However, it was not suitable for the museum building, either spatially or technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
However, it was used until the current art was brought to a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has been more and more crowded.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz reconstructed the pavilion, now bearing the name "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as a Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening there will open the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Belvedere Gallery of Austria in 2007, was introduced.
Husslein-Arco, promoted historical art with a distinguished career, i.e. in the youth of the sculptor, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, strongly promoted the reconstruction of the monuments and monuments of the town of Sotheby.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruby should be exhibited as a foundation of the same name, a café and a bookshop should be created, and an office building should be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, low budget.
Then Krischanitz was an ideal occupier.
Not only did he sensibly reconstruct and expand Joseph Olbrich's sectional building in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna at Schwanzer, and the pavilion was an "extremely important place" for him.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which already lost its utility and ease of use when moving to Vienna.
In the current reconstruction, there were far greater problems: the building was a "catapult for energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade have been replaced, used by glass fibers reinforced insulating glass and glass roof replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold-steel bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been repaired.
The two underground floors provided a place for new use, the abandoned lighting channel between the building and the street features lighting, leads to the entrance of the bridge - almost a new building, but still a rising Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door remained preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion red-brown color tone.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the memorial office and the low budget.
“Often, material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the memorial office,” Krischanitz says, pointing to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was difficult to say with the pavilion "which came here from Brussels", Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
Such an architecture, he said, stands “always in the wrong place” and still wants to “awaken proper self-confidence”.
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, as there was an urban happy accident: in the area around Schweizer Garten a completely new design "City district near the Main Station" with office and residential houses is created.
And perhaps there will be another lucky chance: the house of the 21st century could receive support from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Tempor<0xC3><0xA4>re Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, already one with the town of the neighborhood at the station in Schweizer Garten.
Next articleRoad Plans a Package for a Million-Year Winter Crisis
The track was fuelled by a crisis plan to prevent train crashes in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It'll cost millions.
In the fight against the winter caused by train crashes and delays, Deutsche Bahn is issuing more than 70 million euros this year, according to a report in the newspapers.
The Bild newspaper brought a preliminary report with reference to the internal corporate plan, which is said to have total investments of around 300 million euros by 2015.
With its help, it is said to achieve better use of trains and rail networks also under extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees per 16,000 people to remove snow in railway facilities and outposts.
The goal is to get rid of the starting point for starting operations and 90 percent for operating the necessary deviations over four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, Chief Dr. R<0xC3><0xBC>diger Grube warned after a high-level meeting with government and industry officials about train crashes and delays also during this winter.
In the past winter, the track in personal transport had considerable problems, because, among other things, in difficult weather conditions, there was a lack of reserves.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railways Office for years.
In addition, there is a delay in boarding ICE trains
For years, the track has also failed to manage that the repair of ICE trains must be allowed to be inspected more frequently by the workshop when an ICE train at Cologne’s main station destroyed the repair.
Deutsche Bank Pays $1 Million in U.S. Penalty
After the break-up around the head of Josef Ackermann, there are new trampolines in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank no longer has enough problems at home, a picture of its past in the US has caught up: the Frankfurt institution pays in one settlement of $145 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106 million) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks in the course of financial transactions.
This is the sale of mortgages.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator calculates a number of large banks that have led cooperative banks to false promises to buy financial products; that the risks have probably decreased.
In the course of the crisis, such papers lost considerable value and the banks collapsed with them.
“We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court,” a Deutsche Bank spokesman said in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt by compensating.
This also applies to Citigroup, which committed to paying out $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the reluctance of both monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the U.S. and assists in bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is trying to obtain compensation for the billions of damages caused.
Now the finished equations are the first of their kind.
In the summer, JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland, and Goldman Sachs sued the regulator.
The so-called Mortgage-backed Securities are questionable mortgages.
They are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. bubble around the property collapsed in 2007, a number of financial firms became the deadliest.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Even though the events took place a few years ago, the banks are now in the throes of a sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits in order to achieve corrections or to make a mistake.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
It’s up to 18 international big banks that two U.S. state-owned real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have depreciated about $200 billion in mortgage deals.
Deutsche Bank must also face the FHFA’s lawsuit, which is a number of transactions totaling around $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurt Institute to be responsible for "substantial losses" without, however, stating any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett to invest $10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in IBM’s IT business.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion worth of shares.
So far, significant American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he will not invest in IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies will only be left with difficulties to predict.
However, he has now read IBM’s business reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
Before long, he had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and acquires computer systems for the IT department of other companies.
Warren Buffett’s investment in the financial world is considered a knight’s fit.
As a result, it can now be called the IBM IT motherboard "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett told CNBC that he had purchased a $10.7 billion stake in IBM since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway thus became one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM didn’t know anything about his involvement yet.
He praised the management, who tried even for the economic crisis with good returns.
"You did a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has been investing in lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centers for a long time.
More than a 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as executive computers for companies.
Buffett has been avoiding tech companies to this day.
He claims that he only invests in companies that he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for a freight train, a lubricant manufacturer, or a machinery manufacturer.
Its holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns in addition to about 80 of its own subsidiaries also shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former M<0xC3><0xBC>nchener R<0xC3><0xBC>ck.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the world’s most valuable businesses with smart investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of money making brought him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha".
When Buffett’s investment became known, IBM’s stock rose by one percent before the stock market started.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, has a total market value of more than $220 billion and is considered by Apple and Microsoft to be the most valuable technology companies in the world.
But at Microsoft, so much Buffett, he wouldn't want to perform.
Bill Gates is said to be his best friend.
The threat is tangible.
After the unveiling of "Bulls in Zwickau", Turkish media have questioned the German legal state.
The newspaper even talks about a "bloody ideology" that is now reviving.
The killings of eight small entrepreneurs of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This report was responded with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
Because for many German Turks, the terror that has long been considered dead returns: Since the fire attacks in M<0xC3><0xB6>lln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with the right-wing extremist background.
There has never been any doubt that there is xenophobia in Germany.
However, the discovered right-wing extremist network reveals the extent to which dimensions can no longer be observed.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" were the headlines of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators should have been a secret police officer of the department for the protection of the constitution and fears that German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical mess.
The Turkish village of Germany reacted with great seriousness: it recalled the weekend by demonstrating silence in front of the Brandenburg Gate for victims of racist violence.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish policies, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, a common life was staged - as a history of success.
As a box here, the news of several Turkish media: "Germany's Gift for the Fifty" is the title of an article in the Turkish online platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, the publication of the letter "H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet" for Germany cannot take away, so as not to carry out this thought connection.
"It's starting to burn," reads the column title from Ahmet K<0xC3><0xBC>lahci.
In it, he emphasizes that people who paid taxes and their work made an important contribution to the restoration of Germany were murdered.
The procedure of the police and its late success in the search is most critically discussed in German online forums.
Why didn’t the German authorities think long before to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many are at least rhetorically prepared to use drastic means: "If the activity is carried out so superficially, there will be nothing left for immigrants but their own defence and armaments."
"That would be the best self-defense."
"The quality of clarification and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very strongly on the internal peace in Germany," writes Selen.
What this means is that, if Germany’s internal peace is threatened, the assassinations in M<0xC3><0xB6>lln and Solingen in the 1990s are made clear.
The photo of the burning site in Solingen is deeply embedded in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has made it more clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that mistrust and renunciation can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, made the Turkish side more visible a sense of reciprocity.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press was particularly critical of the failure of German policy after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in M<0xC3><0xB6>lln who survived.
After the burning attack in Solingen, he sent a distressing telegram to the Turkish state president, but at a sad ceremony in Cologne, he let his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then calculated in his speech what fees the Turks were paying.
It is as if the value of a person is measured by the amount of his tax.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the distrust of many of the German Turks in this state-law organization is.
In addition to an effort to clarify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Scandal bank near Lake Cury<0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD>
The most prosperous bank in Europe is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered a near-bankruptcy financial crisis and has since been moving from one crisis to another.
Now it's got a German to compare it to.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that he would embark on an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: the President of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber looked forward to the public, praising Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and saying friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS achieved turnover".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villeger and Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel."
But in September, it was clear that everything was going to be completely different.
One UBS dealer in London bypassed all of the bank’s security systems and lost approximately 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel, not only a recognized banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the President of the UBS Board of Directors has also been on the lookout – and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber Bank has been able to work since February 2012.
And we will take over the presidency of the Board of Directors in May - not just in 2013, as the bank said on Tuesday.
It'll be tough for Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, he's a professor of economics, he's an emissions banker, and he's definitely going to need some time to work.
Once again, we will take responsibility for the strategy of the bank, which has just proved once again that it deserves the title of "Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe"
Because UBS is huge – until recently, it was the world’s largest asset manager – and has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, will not remain the proud Swiss bank saved.
It started with a financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of a quiet and solid but also smart asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to make a difference in investment banking.
Thus, UBS 2007 managed on the one hand with $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it has stepped as an investment bank into the league of the world's largest banks
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a longtime professor of banking in Zurich, said: “I have always referred my students to UBS as a model of a good bank.”
"From today's point of view, one asks, 'How could I have been so wrong?'
He was very wrong.
In 2007, for the first time, it was clear that something in the UBS had gone wrong.
In the middle of the year, the head of the board, Peter Wuffli, resigned surprisingly, who has been considered to be a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker.
A few months later, it was clear why he was leaving.
The investment division of the bank wiped out Subprime papers and had to rewrite billions.
To stop this, UBS announced a capital increase of really 13 billion francs.
That’s why she actually found investors, however, one that she would have just scratched her nose at recently: the opaque Asian State Fund from Singapore and the Arab State Fund, which was so discreet that one didn’t even know its name.
But it was only the first time.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The bank had to admit new billions of losses, and the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, the second highest-paid board in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, a disaster ensued: UBS stood by due to its misinvestment in the financial crisis before collapse and had to be saved by the state.
Nationalbank bought from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on a mandatory exchangeable bond, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken – because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such large banks in its territory.
After all, the balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times higher than the performance of Switzerland’s economy (see picture).
“We couldn’t save UBS again,” says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months, UBS has been capitulating on this in a tax dispute with America and has expressed its willingness to issue data to wealthy customers who, if possible, with the help of banks, have deducted taxes.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million — as a return on unauthorized profits from these trades, including a fine.
In doing so, the UBS was more or less open to helping to reduce taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: a sanctuary of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what it used to be.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And an exodus of customers' money.
Thus, the bank has lost its credibility in both central business areas over the course of several months: in investment banking due to bad speculation and in asset management to help reduce the tax.
And just when it calmed down a little bit, just when it was thought that UBS was coming back again, here comes this unfortunate business anabasis: The only dealer lost 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And it is clear: with risk management in investment banking, this is probably still not the case.
“In the case of Adobola, it turned out that the control of risk has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also certain: “The problem with UBS is that it does not manage risk control.”
At the same time, it was precisely the idea of caution that the Swiss bankers took a long time ago to become custodians of the world’s great assets: no too great a risk, therefore security for money – also from this side the Alpine republic was once again shaken.
The vaults of Swiss banks have become a symbol of unshakeable reliability such as Lindt and Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli for especially high-quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich is still suited to the cliche of a good Swiss private bank - it's just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank is headquartered in the Kury<0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Bahnhofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, which leads directly to the Kury<0xC5><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Lake, which is surrounded by snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rental of shops is one of the highest in Europe.
Crafts like Tiffany's can be found here among the traditional Swiss shops like Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli sugar mills.
For centuries, Swiss banks have been based here: from the Nationalbank through the Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius B<0xC3><0xA4>r.
The reception hall of the UBS is accessed by heavy revolving doors.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, there are huge leather chairs in front of them, next to the logo of the bank, a large direction to the "seif".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
The idea of the Swiss bank, both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, has sometimes been suppressed or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds out.
His name would rather not be read in the newspapers, he concludes, like all Swiss bankers, also with both big banks of the trade.
UBS has probably grown too much, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also expanded.
I don't think the Swiss have anything to say about it.
"And if they did, they would have adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways long ago."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that UBS changed that brought it high profits first and then a disaster: no European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Gro<0xC3><0x9F>bank.
October 15, 2008 was a disaster.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven-million-strong country took the biggest rescue effort in the history of its nation," author Lukas H<0xC3><0xA4>ssig wrote in his book Der UBS-Crash.
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, have been approved by politicians to save them from bankruptcy by standing big banks.
How could that happen?
If you’re talking to Swiss bankers, they see a problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks merged into a large group.
A bank was formed, which was already too big for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and it continued to grow.
At the same time, it helped that the two different banking predecessors of UBS added: One rich but sleeping bank in Zurich with a focus on asset management and poorer but internationally more involved.
All of a sudden, internationalized investment bankers came to the advantage of a lot of money that they could spin a big roulette with.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 the head of the UBS Group and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffly, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the man who controls the feelings around the stomach, who developed from banking science to the very top."
But Ospel eventually relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: “Maybe he thought his models were real,” Geiger says.
"That's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear that pride preceded the fall.
The employees of UBS clearly remember the meetings of the leading employees, on which the CEO of Wuffli repeated the same slogan over and over again: Hit Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The U.S. Bank was the world’s most powerful investment bank.
She was running the "League Tables", an organizer documenting the success of the banks of that time.
In it, the UBS tried to locate the top.
She has already taken a few steps.
In the forex and stock trade, the game was played at the very top.
However, the business advisors who have been entrusted with it highlight one weakness: In international interest trading, in the words of bankers "Fixed Income", there is probably a great distance behind the largest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, the UBS decided to embark on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and its established fund for securing the risks to U.S. investments Subprime.
It developed into a powerful machine that repackaged securities into U.S. mortgages and passed on – but also left the risk to himself.
Also, when other banks have long been looking for a way out.
“In the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” says bank expert Geiger.
The greater the euphoria, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than he thought.
The position at UBS has become a catapulting seat and has been suspended to this day.
Whoever runs a big bank now has an almost unmanageable job.
They need to find a strategy for the bank that all the close business models have disappeared.
Bank expert Geiger already has an idea: The end of investment banking, a concentration on asset management, a return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking is going to lose a lot, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, 51-year-old Swiss Italy was only seen as a transitional solution when the bank unexpectedly broke up with its predecessor, Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel.
In the meantime, he promised to run UBS for a long time, the bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state in the mid-1990s.
3500 seats in a row.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money from?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
In public, however, he only says that he and his wife will find an apartment in Zurich first.
Next year.
Fear of a recession in Europe weighs heavily on the U.S. stock market.
The looming recession in Europe has left U.S. investors with little courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended strike effect.
The stifling production of the industry on the Continent smothered the hope of stabilizing the debt crisis in the womb.

The euro has fallen against the dollar.
Italian and Greek glass in the past week was considered half full, not half empty – but now the problems have come to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, the financial values were on the sales cards.
The Dow-Jones Standard Value Index recorded a decrease of 0.6 percent at 12,078 points to end trading.
During the trading period, the market barometer was between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The widely held S&P-500-Index ended at 1251 points, down one percent.
Nasdaq’s technology stock index lost 0.8 percent and rose from trading with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax said goodbye with a 1.2 percent drop in 5,985 guitars.
The industry in 17 euro-using countries has significantly reduced its production and is preparing to end the boom.
In September, the companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
"We're not an island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe may not recover from the recession so quickly, and there are other signs of bank weakness.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this view: he said in a CNBC interview that it would probably not yet be clear if Europe was strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
That’s why it’s probably too early for him to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left the decades-old principle and entered the U.S. tech industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM strengthened the stock price of the traditional group and left it against the trend in trading at first by almost one percent.
The paper ended almost unchanged at $187.35.

Smart gates are expanding in cities.
In many places, field crows are considered "problem birds": however, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from cities long ago, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: The gates have been a part of the image of the city for centuries, yet in some municipalities the complaints of the inhabitants to the pollution and noise caused by animals accumulate.
At the same time, there is no means of monitoring the "problem birds" so far.
Havens of the field can no longer be thrown out of the cities, experts at the first symposium on the wells in the East Frisian Leer have declared.
There, experts from all over the federal territory were consulted on possible origins.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Nature conservationists have also derived the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected field groves: The use of chemistry in agriculture is destroying the traditional area for life to an increasing extent.
Persecution, growing construction, and fencing of typical trees for nesting birds make life difficult.
The gates are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are amongst others in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and Leer.
There, in 2005, the controversial project of mass murder of the cockroaches in the rural area triggered a negative headline.
Critics have described the capture of animals in traps for birds and the killing of ticks as particularly brutal.
“Normal expulsion, fear, brings nothing,” said urban planner and landscaper Werner Kl<0xC3><0xB6>ver of Leer.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting trees often has adverse consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
"Animals retreat, large colonies split and divide into other places."
Fear can only be thought of as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
It is sensible to combine the expulsion of animals from sensitive habitats and their attachment to settle in other places.
On the other hand, the "information board instead of chain saws" was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens because of a completely different treatment of animals: "One bite in the face can finally best stop being self-confident."
In Schleswig-Holstein, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens co-founded the Ascherberg Science Trail, on which they provide information boards on the life lessons of a highly intelligent field haver.
In the meantime, the project has already received tourists.
Mrs. J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens also had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by the bird: "This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and cleverness of animals are legendary: the Havrans of the field use not only the help to reach the palm tree, but even as a tool to make their own tools.
Researchers from the University of Cambridge recently tested behavior on four field habras, how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones had to bring down the structure in order to get to the larva of the moth.
Without a great training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have to cause the collapse of the platform.
In the second attempt, the lubricated holes then had to solve a more luscious problem.
In the vertically constructed war, the researchers placed a small box with a larval spring.
The birds could not reach their prey with their backs.
However, the researchers placed pieces of wire there.
Of these, all four animals formed hooks, with the help of which, as a bait, she was hunting from the tube of a can for a holder.
Three of the four field oats managed to do so even with a hit.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championships
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for the Cup have not gone away.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland will take part in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-offs.
Led by twice-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd) defeated Portugal Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made a perfect fifth-round appearance in the European Championship after the result of 0:0 in the first match.
The Czechs had enough in a Play-off draw with outsider Black Hora to score 1:0 (0:0) when the first match was clear.
Nor did Croatia score 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland scored 1-1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored another goal for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional Zvezdan Misimovic converted to a penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice reduced for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia has already disappointed in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started at peace.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free kick about 30 meters into the net.
About a good quarter-hour later, Nani showed his quality in shooting at a great distance and adjusted the score from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not make it in the first half, had their first clear chance in defender Edin Dzek.
Former English player Wolfsburu at the head of the standing Manchester City table put the ball head on the lower edge of the abdomen, but the ball did not exceed the goal line (33).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
In the end, he stood at the center of Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
After the action against Helder Postig in the Bosnian penal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and awarded the Portuguese a yellow card.
On the opposite side, Stark made a controversial penalty kick after the action of Fabio Coentra, which Misimovic changed with certainty.
But after the break, the European Vice-Minister of 2004 made it clear with four trophies.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubt in the 81st minute.
With this, the 1976 European Champion leaves for fifth in a row at the European Championship.
However, coach Michal Bilka's men's team with Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second already in the initial phase.
Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the goalkeeper, blocked the possible goalkeeper Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Sivok at the last moment.
Black Mountain had its biggest chances when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from the perimeter of the penal zone just around the Czech Gate.
After the break, the cross-breed had to save the place of the already beaten defender of the Czechs of the world class, once again reduced the striker of FC Soul (50th).
The gate, shortly before the conclusion, finally clarified everything.
At the time, Turkey missed a football miracle from Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to free his place on the bench of third at the 2002 World Cup, Croatia can rejoice in their fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maximir Stadium, the Turks should experience an almost fairy-tale start.
Selcuk Inan shot only the pole from a distance in the seventh minute, the attacker Kazim also could not hang the reflected ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, however, Croatia still took control to a greater extent.
Even after the interruption, the Croats did not receive the gate.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice from VfL Wolfsburg, who released from the 62nd minute of Dortmund's Ivan Perisice, there were legionnaires from the Federal League Danijel Franjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) in the action.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, Ireland celebrated their first European Championship appearance since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni's men, who managed 4-0 in the first game already on a preliminary decision, in the 32nd minute to lead.
Konstantin Vasilyev (57th) equalised for the guests.
Ireland had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had a good chance.
It was only at the last minute that the Estonian defence prevented the possible head of the defence.
In the 32nd minute, it was a long way off.
After the unsuccessful defense of defender Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball across the line to a 1:0 position.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China.
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, is investing billions in China in the coming years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros) were said to have flowed, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create further R&D facilities and employ relevant staff,” said Bill McDermott, the chief executive officer of the Beijing Consumer Fair.
The presence now has an increase from the current 2,500 employees to 4,500.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software is doubling from five to ten or eleven.
SAP is still present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAPU customers are in a booming country.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group’s strategy for 2015.
SAP wants to increase its turnover to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfs held about 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the software manufacturer’s stores are running, which employs 55,000 employees worldwide, as well as almost never before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"We would now like to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
“Our goal is to support China’s continued growth in support of extensive research.”
The massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s emotionally powerful new book Beauty and the Sorrow: The Secret History of the First World War (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with a long list of emerging characters that will take your mind off of it.
One advice on how to behave at the moment: Carefully delete this page and make a bookmark out of it.
You will get to know everyone very well in Mr. Englund’s novel and this list will serve you as a navigation – like a lighthouse – at times when, like men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new vice-chancellor at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as "anti-historical work".
It contains several very well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists and discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's not even a book about what happened, explains the author, as rather "a book about what it was like". It mainly deals with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and sadness" combines the war experiences of 20 more men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, rescuers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others will become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, go crazy or die.
Their lives are shrouded in flames of candles lit in the church - new ones are added to the web of fates, while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book differs from classical historical novels.
He edited the idea that the First World War was only about the terrible tremors on the Western Front.
"Beauty and sadness" explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with falling on them bees nest, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of a pyramid, or facing the presence of many tse-tse.
It’s been a very exciting read almost from the beginning.
The war will engulf people’s lives like some natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling like gunpowder.
When the shooting from the works begins in the distance and you are a woman who is at home with her children, will you escape or stay?
Who's really getting close to it?
Almost no one understands what is going on, not even why the whole war has been started.
"The vacuum created by the lack of facts," said Mr. Englund, "was filled with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and sadness" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are taken from biographies, letters and other materials already published in the universe.
The descriptions of their lives may sound frightening and intriguing, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details, they are completely alive and credible.
Many of them talk about suffering and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "Rangers, everywhere the same substitutes."
"Coffee roasting, aluminum imitation, rubber imitation, paper wraps, wooden knobs."
He continues to do so and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "mass made from pressed rice cooked in bulk fat (and supplemented with fake bone from wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato pods, shoes with wooden soles".
He mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of pairs and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American in himself finds internal hints of savagery and brutality, which he declares about the war: "In the end, you will understand that this is human nature. Not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, with your evening newspapers and groceries and your good books
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he is most likely to die soon and no one will even notice it, in order to grieve.
"If a person finally reconciles himself to sacrificing himself, he would at least expect it to happen before the eyes of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he appears to be a "judgmentor who is secretly hanged."
Other remarks concern the departure of old Europe and the rise of new horrors.
"The conflict has become increasingly an economic competition and a competitive struggle," writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories."
He captured what he called “a new kind of beast of the coming century: an expressive and ideologically entrenched mass murderer in tailor-made clothes that carry out his bloodshed without rising from the table.”
People behave completely unexpectedly, obedience alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some kind of sexual illness from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front line.
“The most grotesque example of this behavior was the trade in gonococcus pus, which the soldiers bought and tortured the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
"The most trusting of them even stared him in the eye, which often blinded him to the end of his life."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is succinct, but it does not show much, which is a great fit for his human subject.
In dozens of small outputs, he captures the way in which the war "disconnected completely unstoppable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly written with references, such as "World War I and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novels such as "On the Western Front of Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most gruesome ending, which in popular scholarly literature has no similarities.
But I won't tell you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped the page from the list of heroes out of your hand and set it on fire.
After the previous error, this time for a minute precisely scheduled time
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because at that time Zuccotti park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the event except a few high-ranking officers, and the others were first told that it was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how much trouble the police department had to face during the operation, was at the forefront of the action.
There was no need to repeat cases in recent weeks where, for example, pepper sprays were used against the demonstrators, which violated the rules of the department and in addition, a wave of public sympathy was poured on the side of the squatters.
Therefore, a police operation aimed at clearing Zuccotti Park from demonstrators was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and practice.
The leaders were inspired by the operations that took place in other cities.
Massive exercises for the case of behaviour in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island section, which was preparing for the action in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have stepped up so-called riot suppression training — counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of police officers — with a focus on the urban part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" stated someone to whom the action was originally explained only as "exercise".
"I know a few police officers who were also called to this event, and no one has told them that they are going to Zuccotti Park," said the person who spoke only on condition that he remain anonymous.
"The fact that he was going to Zuccotti Park, they knew only the highest positions of the members of the department."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson that the city had already received.
On October 14, the city officials planned to clear the park, but then withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they were admitted to the park before the operation began for a hundred years.
Tuesday’s action was attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from around the area – dozens of police officers, who are commonly used to reinforce neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day he comes to the park and leaves a large number of people again, so one hour at night was the perfect time to start the action.
"It was appropriate to do so at a time when there will be as few people in the park as possible," he said.
Before the units left, they lined up at the intersection of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amps.
The lights and recorded news swirling from the amphibians frightened many demonstrators.
When members of the regular units entered the park in their blue windmills, many protesters packed up their belongings and left.
Police say she didn’t touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m., giving the protesters time to pack up.
Other teams of police officers were seen gathering on the edge of the park so that they could break into it if there was a need to make any arrests.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the police department, said it was for their safety.
However, many journalists are of the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her units in action, and in addition, some police officers behaved rudely towards them.
Mr. Browne claimed that the television cars on Church Street driving along the western border of the park could easily be shot.
The police were moving westwards, and there was a dense mix of personal belongings of protesters, including bags and baggies full of clothes, followed by teams from the hygiene department, who immediately scrapped everything that was left in the park.
Some of the protesters who refused to move were pulled out of the park, and documentary footage appeared on the internet shortly after.
The most daring group of protesters fled near the kitchen in their camp, which was located near the center of the park.
Some set up a barrage and the police began their methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp joined each other.
And two people tied to the tree, said Mr. Kelly.
Members of the emergency services were called in to cut off the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly announced.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests took place because of "organization of exclusivity and resistance to arrest," he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, commander of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, head of detectives at the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "did not participate in the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, were raised fortifications.
From these locations, the police developed a protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, police officers were seen, many of whom were equipped with shields, as people pushed further beyond the border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
At about five o’clock in the morning, a protester was seen south of Pine Street as he jumped into the hood of a police car, and several others, who fired air from the tires of the police supply.
At one point, a piece of chips flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one policeman and one protester were hospitalized.
The union of auxiliary workers will sue the city for the release of
The committees representing hundreds of school assistants who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday. They claim that dismissal was not necessary and in addition, it was a matter of discrimination, due to the disproportionate impact on schools visited by poor students.
The Court of First Instance is likely to be the last option that remains for District Council 37 departments in their efforts to reverse the discharge decision.
On the seventh of October, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees who were among the city's worst-paid employees lost their jobs. The health workers described their dismissals by the head of the department as a payment to the city for failing to pay the fine
The city’s officials categorically rejected the accusation.
At a meeting of the city council last month, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said the discharge was part of the budget approved in June.
One of the members of the Council immediately checked that there was no specific mention of the release of aid workers in the budget.
District Council 37 city council officials have announced that they have already filled out the necessary documents and warned the education ministry that they will sue him. On Wednesday, they convene a press conference to formally announce the lawsuit at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the complainant party will be eight dismissed workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as well as most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city’s legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit, and therefore would not make a statement on individual charges.
According to the draft complaint, which managed to obtain the New York Times, the departments focused on the number of people released in the poor parts of the city, thus wanting to support their claims of unfair conduct. The financials are stopped because the poor schools have come to know them.
They point out that while in the schools in the Staten Island section at all, and in the Upper East Side section at least, in Brooklyn, in the District 23 section of Brownsville, 17 school assistants were employed, and in the District 8 and 9 sections of the South Bronx, 46 assistants were released.
He recalls that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, despite being a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says, "It's not a neighborhood full of busy parents who can care about financial resources in the middle of the gap."
The budget of Public School 36 was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way it calculated the bonus funds for every enrolled poor student.
The departments, among other things, claim that the directors of the secondary schools could be confused in the manner in which the document authorizing the release of the parental coordinators was written.
The document used the word "excess" to describe the event, i.e. cancel the position, although this word is used much more often to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school's payroll to the database of available employees, whose salary is paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators have been released," the complaint states, "and not just moved to the database in the position of available workers."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
Before that happened, however, the revolution had to succeed, long-time ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed and the participation of U.S. troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Commission on International Relations of the Senate will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate the Libyans and their supporters.
“With this statement, we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who have begun rebuilding their country,” Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
The above-mentioned sentences may seem innocent, but no debate that concerned Libya until now has not been easy.
Over the years, lawmakers from both sides have been constantly negotiating with each other and with the White House for the text of a series of statements to approve or reject the United States military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of the differing views of both political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that this proposal was rejected in the House, the House also rejected measures that would stop funding U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission in Libya has felt literally in the legislative purge – Congress has criticized the way President Obama directs the mission, but its members have obviously not bothered so much to stop supporting him in his actions.
In the end, the importance of the Congress took precedence over other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission for International Relations, in its statement, "congratulates the people of Libya for their immense courage and admirable tenacity in their efforts to liberate their people" and "congratulates the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies who have joined forces with me."
The statement also "confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal receive full support from the Commission on International Relations, or will the legislators be split into two halves again, as was the case with the adoption of the June proposal?
Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the main representative of the Republican Party, stood against the latest version.
Lugar’s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution on a budget or other subject to be voted on by the entire House or Senate.
For the time being, the other legislators have not even managed to push their proposals back to the vote itself, despite considerable efforts.
Goodlatt’s proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the constitution that were introduced in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal put forward by both the House and the Senate - and others are only minor exchanges of others.
Only in the House can you find at least 15 versions of the supplement on a balanced budget and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their proponents – especially novice Republicans, who want to improve their reputation – can boast of their “authority.”
The revenue on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, required the Parliament and the Senate to vote on the supplement relating to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration to support the creation of such an addendum.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss the limitation of the number of periods in which members of Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be in office as president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a variety of supplements that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains an addendum prohibiting same-sex marriage and an addendum prohibiting the burning of state flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws in the event that two-thirds of states oppose them.
Although members of Congress appear to be very active in the design of various supplements, they do not appear to be significantly out of proportion compared to previous years.
In the 111th Congress they offered 77 additions, while in the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when, according to Senate Library statistics, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than the current politicians.
The last addition, which was added - the 27th addition - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Smashed, but not defeated," Gifford says in his first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after she was hit by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on nationwide television on Monday night, singing along with the melodies of the Broadway show "The Sun Comet"
Giffords appeared in the series "20/20" on ABC News with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that the creation of the branch was still causing her problems and she needed help while walking.
The whole show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary due to the injury caused by a bullet that pierced her skull in front of her, penetrated her left half of her brain, and exited her from the back of her head.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to participate triumphantly in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, during which six people were killed and another 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Giffords replied, "Very well."
An interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the hour-long special of the series "20/20", which was broadcast on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, titled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special watched the entire Gifford reconvalescent from the January 8 shooting.
In the videos that Kelly filmed during the first week, Giffords is seen in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across his forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more than just lift one or two fingers at a time.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and the therapist teaches her how to perform simple tasks.
Swelling of the head.
Explosion of the lips.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast" when demanding changes in her breakfast.
Videos aired on ABC show that Giffords played music as a key role in recovering: Congresswoman sings along to them along with the melodic therapist for the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During an interview with Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, Sawyer revealed that she can’t remember anything from the day she was shot.
Her husband said the Giffords had been reading newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when he was asked for the first time who was the six who were killed in the incident.
The suspect is Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a prison in Missouri, where he is awaiting trial under the influence of violent drugs.
"A lot of people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Dark, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point during her recovery, his wife said, "I lost."
"So I immediately told her, Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly said.
"You just got the charger.
But you'll do it, you'll come together, and you'll come back stronger than ever before."
Military units are met with compassion rather than with respect.
The event was a gala evening on Wall Street, which brought in millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don’t have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines walked around him.
The festively dressed crowd rose up and squealed with enthusiasm.
“Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring benefit.
On the evening of the ceremony, the then Chairman of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff was also present. In addition to him was Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military units in a somewhat different way.
"They were all introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought that well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect, it was regret.
So completely opposite impressions only illustrate the uneasy relationship between the army and the often measured, sometimes celebrating the American public.
The army is inexorably included with praise for its victims.
But this honor is worth something, the soldiers say.
The public is behaving more and more as if the individual in the uniform is grieving.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and soon left Afghanistan.
“But the only way some of us can support us seems to be to put us in the role of unhappy souls.”
This topic is very sensitive to military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or to spoil the public relations they serve.
They also realize that the anger they had to face with the troops returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most of the words about regret are spoken in silence and in private among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired colonel Mark Canciana returned from combat operations, where they served as members of the Marines, their father warned them that people outside the army would look at their service from two angles.
From the point of view of some, they will feel respect and wonder because they have defeated the enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
But the other one will shake his head if "an evil, violent veteran does not hide under the surface," said Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and after returning occupied a place in Washington in the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people who were interviewing him had an impromptu indication of whether he could withstand the stress associated with working in Washington so soon after returning to the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
The military’s concerns stem in part from America’s indifference to wars.
Successes in the battlefield rarely accumulate recognition in a country that has little knowledge of its own army and finds little self-interest in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer regard military heroism as it used to be during World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who led U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army is facing growing pressure to strike hard against rape.
This week it will be decided whether the trial of 28 women and men against the army will be initiated for alleged inaction in the case of rape.
If not, hundreds of other applicants are prepared to file a lawsuit.
The first-class soldier, Elizabeth Lyman, was allegedly raped by her army colleague at the age of 25 and was in her 11th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008 and she headed to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend she bumped into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join her, so they could have a drink in her room.
"There was a warning light in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texasan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"That I would listen to my instincts."
She claims that just a few minutes after they entered her room, the man went over to her, threw her in bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the army will be waiting for a verdict of hearing, which could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against Donald and the former former minister are being brought against the former minister.
The indictment states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the fight against the spread of rape in the army, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The indictment was filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke and the plaintiff party had 17 members at the time. However, during the following months, their number increased to 28 - 25 women and three men, all of whom claimed to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted and sexually assaulted in arboreal manner.
Burke claims that it goes down the throats of the highest-ranking commanders of the army, because the problem begins right at them.
"The army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to impose measures against such acts? Top Command."
Burke also claims that since February she has contacted at least 400 more survivors, many of whom could become part of other claims filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than pooling all the charges into this case – she put all the eggs in one basket, as she herself says – she will file a lawsuit in several different cases if it is necessary to keep the pressure off.
The defense team is led by U.S. State Representative Neil MacBride, who, along with his colleagues, urged the case to be dismissed.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy – in principle, the fact that current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court order known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries are related to the military services of the plaintiffs," the document said.
The Ministry of Defence has refused to comment on the matter.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in the fight, it is only a matter of wording: in modern wars it is difficult to find a clearly defined front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women occurring in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers fell between these wars - two-thirds of them directly in combat.
The time has come for modernization to take place in the army, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, but three other lawyers are involved in the case.
At Yale Law School, visitors to the Veteran’s Law Seminar are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for the supposed development of an atmosphere that promotes hatred of women.
Regardless of this, the non-profit organization of the American Vietnamese veterans collects evidence for its lawsuit against the army. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of "personality defects", which was allegedly detected in the victims of the rape, so that the army has an active motive for their
As early as December, her group filed a lawsuit against the state organization for dealing with veterans, which she accuses of discriminatory practices that should have occurred in the processing of requests for assistance from people who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented to Congress by a group of senators and MPs from both political parties and proposed a number of remedial measures in them.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Resolution of Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defense, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimates, this figure corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
A report released in March also discusses the extent of the criminal prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the army were brought to court - which is half versus the civil justice system.
Prosecutors in the case of Agent Burke describe the attacks as only the first of a whole series of traumas.
Lyman, for example, reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to happen.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape eleven times to various members of the police, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the necessary examinations to determine the rape, and in her bed was found the blood of the assailant - from the wound she had inflicted on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, she attended Lyman’s hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions about whether she fell in love with her friend on the day of the attack.
Six people were summoned to testify in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted of the charges.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," Lyman said.
"I had the feeling that I was going to give birth right there - with a scream I ran out of the courtroom."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember I said to my commanding officer, 'It wasn't his court, it was mine.'"
Lymans were ordered to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, calling her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was released from the army without honor and therefore without the right to serve.
Whether the case of Lyman and other plaintiffs moves to the next stage or not, it’s a long-term run, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University of Law.
However, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to move on to the next stages of negotiations."
However, between them and the verdict stands the above-mentioned doctrine, which has been criticized since the first moment the light of the world was seen.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine doctrine.
The army is a few decades behind, as their duties do not allow them to adhere to the same level of motivational incentives and deterrents.
He adds, "The odds are hard against them... but it's important for them to try it."
Change will only happen if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in their favor, Burkevo<0xC3><0xA1>, the plaintiff’s lawyer, will collect hundreds of other people prepared to file the lawsuit and will start working on other cases relating to the subject.
“We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue where reform will not come from,” he says.
Or until we die, depending on what comes before.
Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Explore You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who admitted to the July murderous rage, after which 77 people died in Norway, took part in his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was definitely not alone in cyberspace: during the preparation of the attack, he spent a lot of time at the computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the right-wing groups on social media sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
“We realized that getting them isn’t that hard at all,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recently published report by the British research team on European digital populism.
The stock of personal information on Facebook is so vast, says Bartlett, that scientists have had enough to simply use the ad on the site and, thanks to this, have determined with absolute accuracy the demographic group they’ve been looking for — something marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe found half a million fans of right-wing groups, so they turned their attention to them and sent out advertisements to them. But instead of calling them to the newly formed group or offering them some diet products, they called out to them to ask questions.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries – without having to leave the office at all.
"It's a completely new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results aren’t all that surprising: online right-wing supporters are all young men who are pushing the rising rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, “those who combine their online activism even with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the computer screen.”
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists, and political researchers use this site to study everything from health issues to social trends, covering up-to-date statuses, wall posts, and push-buttons like "I like it."
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them will provide three different data per day on average, which makes this social network literally "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic works, called "Facebook", is 80%.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it allows them to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
“It used to be that when you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You’d have to get to a place where you’d never be left,” Bartlett says.
"Facebook is all about it - you just go right to them."
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify a socio-health problem and avoid them.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that college students who discussed their drunken Facebook outings were far more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about the topic.
Morenov<0xC3><0xA1> suggests that the page’s student peers monitor and come up with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
“The problem can’t be solved if you can’t diagnose it,” said Dr. Morena’s co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
“We’ve found a way to identify endangered children that we wouldn’t otherwise have a chance to discover.”
Facebook is constantly researching the data of its users.
The website’s information team has compiled statistics on the relationship between relationship status and Valentine’s Day, election participation in 2010 and the ratio of people’s satisfaction (primarily using the information they had access to – Internet freedom advocates have long maintained that they should be aware of the fact that they have a long-standing bias.
But Facebook users know that the site is watching, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the option to play Scrabble with a friend that is thousands of miles away, the site needs to provide their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don’t even know about?
Scientists have a clear set of rules on how to collect data offline, but online data is accessible to everyone.
“In my opinion, most users didn’t even think that scientists could look into their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using his students’ public Facebook walls.
"When it comes to them, they take it that there is information only between them and their friends."
It is also important to consider the question of methodology.
Even when researching offline, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
It is not possible to verify on Facebook how much of the profile information and wall posts are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn explains.
That’s why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, believes that the pencil and notebook continue to be the best possible tool that can be used in research.
“When you go into the real world and talk to real people, it’s something that can’t be replaced,” he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik takes part in his first public court hearing
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who admitted to plotting two attacks during which 77 people were killed this summer in Norway, described himself as a “fight fighter” during his first public hearing in Oslo.
"I am the military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and among the Norwegian Knights Templar," he said in a statement to the court, where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the court because your mandate has been granted by organizations that support the ideology of hate and because they support multiculturalism."
"I confess my deeds, but I do not confess any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik interrupted during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a podium from which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought the prepared speech with him, to allow his relatives to speak at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from any contact with the media for 4 weeks, and announced that the authorities would have full control over all of his visits and visits for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and survivors.
Some have come in the hope that they will be able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he is held firmly under the lock.
Everyone took part in the move to move the case to a quick closure.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," one of the survivors of the attack told the NRK commentator.
"It wasn't a pleasant thing, but I can say for myself that after I saw and heard the suspect, I mentally moved a little bit further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. Upon arrival and departure to the building without difficulty looking at the journalists present and survivors in the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge stated that he was not crazy, and noted that there is no evidence that he would have any collaborators.
For some, it may be comforting that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the sadness and confusion that is still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I wish it would look like a creature, but it's not," said a relative of the victim.
"If it did, it would be a lot easier."
7 Lessons from a Lost Interview with Steve Jobs in a Movie Heading to the Movies This Week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of the people who compared him to Henry Ford began to emerge – and they chose him as his genius as the greatest modern inventor.
In a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs, which was cast for a special film set to go to the cinema this week, it will be for all Apple fans that his creative mind has completely understood the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer, and a self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a person who puts every detail into the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the idea that a good product is a good idea of 90 percent"
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumph of Computer Madness, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers. During filming, a unique, more than hour-long interview took place.
By that time, it had been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he had full hands working with his new computer company NeXT, and he looked impatiently at how the general public would accept the Internet.
In the end, only a short part of the entire Cringely interview was used in the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were said to have been lost during the transfer.
Shortly after Jobs’ death, VHS copies were found in the director’s garage.
It is this material, slightly cut out, that forms the basis of the 68-minute Steve Jobs: A Lost Interview, which is heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
On someone who has made a name for his dislike of giving longer interviews, Jobs seems so surprised that he can talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
He also appears to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when it's seen how Jobs thinks the answer perfectly to be as sophisticated and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism emerges on the surface, when he acts impatiently in Cringely’s questions and encourages him to get to more important issues and topics more quickly.
The interview was filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, and there are upright prophetic ideas in it when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and badly, offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read the posthumous evaluation of Jobs’ career, but on Jobs, which we see here as an eager dreamer in the blossoming of his genius, is something raw and inspiring.
He has his own vision of how things could and should look like.
It did not take long, and after he had expressed his thoughts, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
"During the years of business, I've always wondered, 'Why are you doing this?' and the answer was always the same: 'Well, that's just how it's done.'
No one knows why he does what he does, never think deeply about business-related things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues by describing his efforts to simplify the accounting process at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way in which the costs were recorded - often starting with the inscription "standard costs", their amount could only be thought of. At the time he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool, which guaranteed that they could cut down the store shelves
How he performed the Rosary on the Pope:
Jobs recalls the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively bump into the phone company and call anywhere in the world for free.
A number of things have been written about this device in the past, but Job’s enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as a tool of power is literally infectious.
It tells how Wozniak and Wozniak tested the devices using a paid phone and during the call they were allowed to switch from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
“At least half a dozen times we’ve been around the world, so when we shouted something into a paid phone, it sounded a minute later from the second phone at the door,” Jobs laughs.
“We were young and we found that we can build something ourselves that is capable of managing infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world.”
The two of us made a little thing that managed to control a much bigger picture – it was an incredible experience and I think Apple would never have been able to do it without it.
In the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, and they gave the best of themselves for Henry Kissinger, who had been with Wozniak in the middle of the night.
Gradually, members of the Catholic Church were called up to speak with the American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before the Pope himself woke up on the phone, the two were delighted and laid down their ears.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, and he was carrying spare parts to build a frequency gauge, he found Bill Hewlett's number on the phone list and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had already secured a summer brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what a company really is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company’s Palo Alto research lab, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever built.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a CRT monitor, and I immediately fell in love with him.
As a teenager, I went up and up at HP, leaned around that computer, and started writing programs for it.
How Innovation Is Invented:
In several places during the interview, Jobs talks about how he invents new products during the run.
At the beginning of his career, when he went out to sell a couple of boards with flat connections, one customer asked him to put the whole computer together for him.
He had only 30 paid days available, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember fighting wildly... shouting at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] when I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer.”
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big a company breathes:
Long before he led Apple’s revival, Jobs transparently predicted that many industry leaders in his vision would be strangling and losing their market share.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copies or printers, so what’s next?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At the moment, there is already a lot of sales and marketing, so companies are headed by people who are taking care of this, while people who are taking care of their own products are being pushed out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that led the company to its unshakeable position is now being replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are necessary.
This is exactly what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have literally owned the entire computer industry.
It could be ten times bigger than it is, it could be Microsoft's 1990s...
Instead of winning, they lost.
How to take innovation as a form of art:
“Between an excellent idea and an excellent result product, there is still a long way to go and a lot of work ... and how that great idea evolves and changes and grows.”
During that time, you will learn a lot about him.
You have to come up with a whole range of compromises - certain things just don't force you to do electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You have to keep in mind constantly 5,000 things - different concepts - and put them together...
In the end, it depends on taste - you try to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and in a certain way you try to shine them into what you are doing yourself.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I’ve never been ashamed of having the best ideas.
The Macintosh company was so amazing and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and, by the way, also the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they would be able to do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the Health Care Act at a time when their case was being dealt with by a court
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether to accept an objection to President Obama’s Health Care Act, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended the ceremony.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine of the judges met to discuss the proposals submitted.
One of the cases under consideration was a lawsuit filed by 26 states questioning the radical reprocessing of healthcare approved by Congress last year — a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the lawsuit, but a 5.5-hour hearing is expected in March, the result of which will further develop the presidential elections, which are scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
A lawyer who will stand before a court of law and try to reach a rejection of the law will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the U.S. Attorney General for George W. Bush’s government.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has been advocating conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations questioning the laws, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which they are in the process of betting huge funds.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel a few hours after the court discussion on the subject of the case.
She was also attended by, among others, Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of Republicans in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
How about introducing guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: these two judges have been taking part in the Federalist Society for years.
And it is certainly not about anything that would be contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to comply with the principles of conduct to which lower federal judges are subject.
However, if that were not the case, their conduct would certainly fall under the C4 principle, which says that "the judge may participate in actions that are currently being organised by related and other organizations for the purpose of obtaining financial resources, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honest guest, nor an act.
However, Scalia and Thomas’ relationship with the two law firms operating in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in the case, was rich enough to alarm activists calling for ethics in the government.
“This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to several judges’ claims that the Supreme Court is acting under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges drank and dined on social benefits together with legal representatives waiting to hear their case before the court."
Their presence and assistance in the acquisition of financial means through this action undermines the feet by all claims of indifference, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little understanding to their critics and have shown them that they also seamlessly combine their judicial responsibilities with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife Ginni is a high-ranking conservative activist.
In addition, conservatives argue that the ethical problem is mainly Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan worked as the attorney general for President Obama’s government when the first objections to the law appeared before the court.
Kagan's critics press her to resign her participation in the case, claiming that she was fighting for the law so much that she could now be unconcerned.
Kagan didn't mean she was going to step down.
Boeing has received a record-breaking contract for US$18 billion in jets
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 twin-turbo jets with the option to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than $1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, it’s usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if that company is the manufacturer of the Boeing Co. aircraft and the price of these 50 aircraft makes a total of a record $18 billion, that’s something else.
The same important news is also from where Boeing got the contract: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future orders of aircraft.
According to a forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing has announced its largest order in history in terms of dollar values for commercial aircraft - 50 twin-aisle Boeing 777s - on the weekend.
The sensational contract came from Emirates Airlines based in Dubai.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airlines have the option to purchase another 20 aircraft, bringing the total value of the contract to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air airlines had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes referred to as Dreamliners, which are proud of significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the entire Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are also among the more oil-producing nations.
This means that they not only have money to pay for aircraft, but the rise in the price of propellants - mostly damaging airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive, because the country alone makes money at higher oil prices.
That’s important because they’re not as likely as other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to fuel price increases, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The order from Emirates confirms Boeing’s leading position in the market for wide-body aircraft and brings Airbus SAS into the tight ranks, which wanted to try to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus representatives announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, which is a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, will take off.
The displacement was due to the fact that customers required a larger payload of the aircraft and landing, so the manufacturer took the time to be able to supply the machine with more engine power.
Share price of Boeing Co increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexico’s president’s sister was reportedly defeated in the Michigan election.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of PRI, was helped by drug dealers in the lobby behind the governor's chair.
Sister Felipe Calderon seems to have lost the post of governor in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n in the violent state elections, and on Monday she declared that one of her opponents was helped by drug dealers to win.
The preliminary results were attributed to the leadership in the Western state's governor's elections to Faust Vallejo by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The involvement of members of organized crime in the entire electoral process, and especially in the course of the election itself yesterday, is alarming not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, but for our entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the public opinion survey group... they entertained ballot boxes, they built roadblocks... and they let people vote for the PRI order.
The PRI party ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost the presidency.
However, he plans a quick return to power and victory in the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n elections is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win the presidential election in July as well.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who led the day before the election, only very narrowly.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as the winner.
The third was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which until now had been controlled by the governor’s office. It is a very unfortunate defeat for the distraught and unfortunate persecuted party before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the capital of the state named Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug dealers and invites other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the birthplace of President Calderon, and it was in Michoacan that in December 2006 that he launched a military campaign against the smugglers.
But the violence persisted.
PAN mayor Luisa Marie Calderon’s abstention was killed just a week before the election and many candidates withdrew from the election out of fear.
However, regardless of whether the election results in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n look like a PRI party, the victory of the party will help to gain a new impulse.
The expected PRI representative in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington Valley congratulated and said: "I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from its serious debt crisis, otherwise there could be a total decline in the world economy, which would have a negative impact on the growth of the economy in Asia.
Rajat Nag, chief executive of Manila-based ADB, said the world’s two fastest-growing economies must “do everything in their power” to help speed up the recovery of the currency bloc through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and not the IMF.
He warned that the Bric Group states [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were monitoring all European difficulties "too unexcited" and said that Asian financial assistance, combined with European leadership and funds, would help fuel long-term economic downturns.
"We're all in this together."
“So anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis is right,” he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it’s definitely not immune.”
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Union has been experiencing a serious debt crisis for several months now.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have risen dangerously and the Italian and Greek governments have stepped down.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that it could pull the global economy back into recession, and there has been a call for a new booming front-line economy to come together and help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union's Financial Assistance Fund, an institution for European financial stability - would give Asian partners European countries a greater opportunity to negotiate.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do what it can” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a drain on the influx of foreign capital.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and uneasy,” he said.
“We are facing a difficult task and we must maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an alternative, it’s a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that emerging economies, such as the Indian one, have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid to Europe’s 1.2 billion people when 800 million of them live on $2 or less a day.
“One could find that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and enjoying their holidays on the beaches, which would probably be hard to explain to them,” he said.
Lee Howell, general manager of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to keep the well-paid jobs of many Greek citizens in poorly managed and losing sectors, such as railways.
Mr Nag stressed that the Eurozone crisis was threatened by a "dangerous domino effect".
The bank’s forecast that between 2011 and 2012 there will be 7.5% economic growth in Asia is now facing a “risk of decline” due to the European threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets must create “plans of unpredictable expenditures” to be protected from the decline and significant capital outflow from their economies.
Pentagon Warnings on Possible Defensive Shortages
Defense Minister Leon Panetta on Monday, in Congress, put it neatly under the boiler, warning that sweeping automatic budget cuts could jeopardise national security and trigger a financial chain reaction beginning in the Pentagon and continuing across the mountainous and civilian terrain in Afghanistan.
The Pentagon will now have to spend a $450 billion budget reduction over the next ten years, but it is now worried about a further $600 billion reduction if Congress fails to reach a spending deal.
“The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and the resulting so-called shutdown would result in a 23% fall in the pace and stop many new projects.
"Due to such a huge reduction, used in this incalculable way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you can not buy only three-quarters of a building or a ship. In addition, there could be serious damage to the modern
“We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction has to go so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements.”
"These changes can shake the faith of those who care about our army and seriously damage its readiness."
In the end, the cuts will also affect combat units, Panetta announced.
"Although the accounts for financing possible offshore war operations will not directly affect this holding, the operations will be negatively affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contract personnel, which will result in a delay in the agreed contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
"The conditions of paid employees will be reduced, from which there will also be a flow of late payments to suppliers and subsequent disruption of legal and political support."
The two senators wrote to Panett ten days ago asking him for details on the possible impact of automatic cuts on the defense ministry.
"The consequences of the stay at the Department of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this hard measure," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon, when they published Panett's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign under it."
"Planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
“It will only be seen if Panett’s letter and a fresh warning will increase the pressure on Congress approving the budget and strengthen the voices calling for the Pentagon to leave the list of demarcated areas.
Panetta has been more open lately in talks about possible cuts, even though he himself has moved to his senior position in the Pentagon with years of experience in approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going to get there.
At a press conference held a minute week, the Minister of Defense indicated a brief picture of what his resort can expect - a shell of the army, however, within which there will be no core.
"It will be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a brigade without ammunition."
"It'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"It's going to be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," Panetta said at the start of a speech in the Pentagon.
"He will be like a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
In an annex to the letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, it specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: a late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; a significant limitation of the possibilities of landings and deployments around the world; presumed unacceptable operational risks in the future."
Panetta added that some of the biggest defense projects could wait for an end, including those that have already been tested, and those that are only in the early stages of planning.
For example, on the list was a project of the F35, a planned new bomber, a new generation of ballistic submarines, a new coastal battleship and a new ground combat vehicle, which the army and naval infantry wanted to replace the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next ten years, but its proponents say it is a necessary next step in improving the army that is needed to deal with possible threats and other threats from China.
How to Recognize a Lie
A fleeting look at recent newspaper headlines predicts how serious and ubiquitous lies and deception are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has full hands of work accusing him of sexually harassing several women – both sides say the other is lying.
Administrators at Penn State University were accused of false testimony when they tried to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting the boy.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught last week, as he told US President Barack Obama via a microphone that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lying has been able to destroy entire careers and shut down the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately refuted by unquestionable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of abusing finances from his campaign to try to cover up his marital relationship.
And no one will ever forget the media circus around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period as a function of his sexual attraction to Monica Lewinsky.
There are stories of cheating everywhere at school and at university.
There are times when teachers themselves give their students test answers, just to make themselves look good in their own judgements.
Mentors, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many scams do we face?
Studies show that in a single day you snore somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let us suppose that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that during the first ten minutes of the first meeting in life, strangers cheated three times.
Determining a lie, or "recognition of a lie", is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire, whether for personal or work reasons.
However, this is not a social game that would be similar, say, to the charade, when a person shouts, "I have you". Recognition of deception is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected over the past six decades in the field of psychology.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been refuted.
The liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're shaking, they're drinking, they're red or they're wearing a scarf.
However, do not assume that it is difficult for a liar to observe and reveal.
The trained lie ID can reveal the truth from the wet construction, small expressions in the face, the way the questions are formed and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from the vast and developing industry concerning the recognition of lies, and it is clear that the discovery of deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and will make it difficult for you in today's complex world to learn - it can be of great help
Good liars can read well in others, let them bark in caution, direct their emotions and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men carry more "self-centered" lies, while women say more lies "focused on others" - mostly to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than to their peers.
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called "initial observation."
Thanks to him, he will have a later finding out what to compare with.
Notice the posture of the subject’s body, his laughter, the work with his voice.
You should know if someone is regularly patting their feet so that you don’t wrongly accuse them of lying just because they start patting their feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
However, take it only as a warning sign, not as evidence of a lie.
People who lie can stop moving the upper half of the body, when trying to remember their fictional story, the tips of the shoes can turn to the door, bend to the east, significantly change the posture of the body, or give the appearance of a "leverage" after the conversation ends.
People conducting interviews often issue a false signal that there is an interview at the end, just to see how the relief will look after its termination.
Enter the language of the subject as well.
The famous story is about how Scott Peterson once betrayed and used the past time when he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, which ran a nationwide search for her body.
Fraudulent individuals can also express themselves in a moderate way: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky" or the difficult question they're all repeating.
The most common verbal signs are just very inconspicuous.
Someone can use a lot of "relieving language" when he answers a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... according to my best knowledge."
In such a response, we do not learn too much facts, and it is often another warning signal.
There is no magic that can reveal every lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills with which a lie can be traced.
With the help of these skills, one will have a greater chance that in his personal and work-related failure to encounter a liar and a fraudster.
Controversial plan to build an oil pipeline will be rerouted after a threat of delay of approval by the U.S. government has emerged
A few days after Obama’s government threatened to delay approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico — which was respectful of the industry but calmed the environmentalists — the company with the pipeline building announced to the public that the project would be rescheduled and rescheduled.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it is moving the planned route of pipelines from the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will be approved anyway.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Government of Nebraska.
TransCanada’s Alex Pourbax claims that the company is convinced that the pipeline will eventually be approved, although it will lead a different route.
This announcement came after the Foreign Ministry announced last week that it is delaying the decision on a federal permit for the project, from which it will not conduct studies of possible replacement routes that would allow it to not interfere with the Sandhills area in Nebraska and into the subterranean species Ob<0xC3><0xA1>lya.
"This is really moving forward," Republican Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
The new environmental judgment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, that is, a year after the next election, but the authorities refuse to play any role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a foreign ministry request and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile-long pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas, 700,000 barrels of oil flow per day.
Six states will have to cross this path.
This project is completely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by the work force, who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will be created while working on the pipeline.
The Nebraska Legislature, however, opposed the plan and considered the introduction of laws that would force the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and the watershed of Ogallala, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing study on the ecological impact commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project will have only a small negative ecological impact, but a source from the energy industry said that the inspector general of the Ministry ordered a new review of the process and examined the whole process.
Once upon a time, a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s advisor in 2008, did not represent a conflict of interest in the program.
Further, whether the company that was hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of repelling fear because of her baton
The New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle furiously stormed into the vestibule of their Manhattan home and frightened their daughter by the fear that she would return.
"Lady Marmalade" singer Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, was so terrified that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said in a lawsuit filed with the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10 last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a teacher at the school, and Genevieve went on a family trip.
When Kevin Monk parked the car, Roseanna Monk packed her bags down to the vestibule of their house on Riverside Boulevard and took Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and put the baby down for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, "You know what your daughter's doing?" I said, "Yes," and I left to pick her up."
LaBelle was angry with the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,'" said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you think."
She became angry and began to speak out loud, shouting out in the simplest terms...
She had a bottle of water with her, and she started to pour water on me.
They say Genevieve got a hysterical seizure.
"I said to the woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter.' " said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - and had to stop her until her escort, who then dragged her into the waiting car, told Roseanna Monk.
In the meantime, her daughter was screaming so loudly that she refused, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter asking LaBelle for an apology, but they did not receive any answers.
LaBelle's lawyer and vocalist do not respond to our calls to express their case.
The lawsuit calls for closer to an unspecified, but family law representative, Sam Davis, said the case was taken for free and that the family plans to devote all of the money raised to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
“The goal is to force Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for her actions,” Davis said.
“Such behavior is completely unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an eighteen-month-old child in his arms.”
Climate change has slowed the economy.
During the first year of the government of Maria L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdeze, unemployment and unreliability increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment decreased and with them the economy
The year 2011 is recorded in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Maria L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, who calls himself the government of change. This government has brought with it great expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to the lack of favorable weather conditions.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in agriculture, reduced the chances of growth of the state economy, are aware of a decrease in economic activity by 3.6% in the first half of this year. In the field of agriculture there was a historical decline of 31.16%.
According to the report on the damage caused by the Mexican Council for the sustainable development of the countryside, the damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% was completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were looted and looted.
the decline in economic activity until November the unemployment rate did not increase by 69%, the unemployment rate did not increase by 69% and the unemployment rate did not increase by 53%, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography of the State, during the first three quarters of the year.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantese, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, it is possible to explain the increase in unemployment indirectly, based on the steps that have been taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is related to various factors. Among them are the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints due to legislation approved by the Congress in connection with the fight against dirty money, the investors did not hesitate to do so.
Cessation of migration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes said that the demographic factor also contributes to the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave for work abroad, to the United States, has decreased, but this is because of the difficult entry, and also because even if these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job, so people do not stay and ask for us.
Unreliability
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also worsening due to the growing unreliability, which prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the state is working without paying taxes.
Other features of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and unreliability. In this administrative territory are the lowest wages from all over the country, as indicated by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 pesets as of September, well below the national average, which amounts to 7,375 pesets.
Shortening of Foreign Direct Investments
Along with the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, in the period from January to June, the foreign direct investment amounted to USD 530 697, which amounted to USD 530 697, which amounted to a surplus of USD 5,7 per cent.
On the other hand, the Ministry for Economic Development of the State Government mentions investments of 17 280 million pesets per year. These investments were mainly directed to companies in the field of services.
Duluh
In the context of the scenario of the decline of the economy, the government of this state asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be aimed at investing in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local congress approved a loan of 2 million pesos.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector of the first year of the government, Maria L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés pointed out the lack of governance skills.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the will of the individual sectors, including the government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa has been really inconsequential during this year. We need to work hard to get back the land we lost this year. In 2012 we need to double our efforts, there will be no harmonizing the efforts of all of us and from
The Decline of the Economy
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said that events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"Weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, among other things by frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to regain momentum, which would allow us to achieve an acceptable level of productivity,
Re-definition of the message
According to Teodora Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers’ Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, it is necessary to pressure the state into more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we observe that it is working. We believe that it is necessary to prepare a long-term plan, in which the goals and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of material, human, and human resources", Sinaloa said.
The work that is ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of setting a vision for the future that would better guide the government’s efforts.
“In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, there have been some progress in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan,” he said.
He said that the current administration has shown progress when it comes to the conduct of public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be welcoming. I can say that there is work done here and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kg of marijuana
Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fines for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted for a criminal act threatening health, specifically for holding marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by members of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 during a march on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite station 80 in El Castillo district, Navolato.
The dealer went in the delivery type pick up white. In the car in the shelf had a black bag and a small backpack on the seat of the passenger. Soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured man remained at the disposal of the Judges of the Second Chamber and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Implications of Criminal Offences.
They owe contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants, face the danger that they will not be brought to an end or that they will have major delays due to missing economic resources, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Mira said.
The director of urban social development said that if construction work had so far gone ahead, he now threatened that the state government would not be able to secure the relevant supplies, which require funds of more than 11 million pesos for three programs.
He stated that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. Up to this time, only the Federation and the city have added funds to the work, so it is possible that there will be a delay in the implementation of projects.
"They're supposed to secure almost 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, we haven't got anything at all. And even though we were supposed to get a share in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we started and continue projects very well."
He said that last year, for the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state did not meet the relevant supplies, and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan in order to pay more than 7 million that the state administration did not give them.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. In order to get to the programs mentioned this year, we had to get the funds that would cover what the state did not do," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a promise on the part of state representatives regarding the transfer of these resources, he stated that an application was sent to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to expedite the proceedings and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
“We were supposed to give us 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we haven’t even got a peso yet.”
Court Approves ‘End of Analog Broadcast’ in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) has rejected a constitutional lawsuit filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which wants to speed up the so-called "disablement of analog signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his powers when he issued a decree detailing individual steps leading to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was rejected, because a qualified majority of eight votes was not reached, necessary for the court to express itself to the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the said decree, which thus remains valid.
The draft judgment prepared by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero proposes the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all matters relating to radio and television is a matter that is subject to the law of the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel).
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to combat the decree. Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero accepted the demands and stopped the implementation of the decree and all the actions described therein, leading to the transition to digitization.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the motion made by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the debate on the proposal, which also has Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero in charge.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not identify with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general standards measures to prepare public administrations.
"I don't think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulator," he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It is thought that to distance the change would be to distance the benefit of digitalisation, which requires a decision in the public interest. Digitalisation does not only have a technical dimension, but "is also concerned with economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these issues "require the operation of the entire system established, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a whole range of competences entrusted by the Constitution to the hands of the government of the state".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to a digital system and had done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialized technical authorities at their disposal.
He stated that it is not possible for the government to issue an unconscionable decree, which to some extent interferes with the jurisdiction of Congress, to introduce into the jurisdiction of the administration the observance of laws prepared by the legislature.
In Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n they analyze the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to data published by PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. So far, the votes of 879 out of 6074 electoral districts have not been counted.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" appeared in this year's elections in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, where according to the data published by the Pre-Election Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place in the governor's elections is not as much as 27%, and that's not as much as 8 percent of the votes.
In this connection, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, President of the General Council of the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n Electoral Institute (IEM), recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority approved a number of measures that should harmonise local federal reform norms.
As will be recalled, Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n officially did not confirm his political constitution or his status as a member of the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act. The State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was due to expire.
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative power and declared the vote of the head of state on constitutional reforms to be “invalid and illegal” because it has no right to “either approve nor veto” them.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal replied that thanks to the approval of the relevant measures, it would be possible for the IEM General Council to carry out partial and total censuses by the local electoral authority.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, one or more electoral rolls, may be carried out under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of the counting of votes and the calculation in the relevant box or the position of the President of the Chamber;
In addition, the overall recalculation of votes in all ballot boxes will be possible if there is evidence to suggest that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; always at the beginning of the ballot box and at the beginning of the ballot box
The total count of votes will also be made when, after a proper count, it will be found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request for a political party
It should be noted that in such a situation there is an election in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between first and second place is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in Mount Zaflanamé, the family confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday there will be a ceremony and a spiritual Mass.
According to the family, the lieutenant's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the mountain of Zapalinamé.
After receiving the highest honors along with the other people who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortese family returned to the capital of Coahuila on board the Mexican Air Force aircraft. The family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the afternoon, the lieutenant’s ashes arrived at the chapel located in the class of Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, which was organized by his former high school technology colleagues and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of preparation for maturation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the mountain of the Flames. That's what he always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young and attended the Colegio del Aire air school in Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe it because they said he was even driving a truck, yet he always went after his dream of becoming a pilot.
His son-in-law Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio recalls him as a very good man, "the plot came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan to promote his uncle, so he is convinced that he died in what he liked best in life: flying an airplane.
They gave him the last goodbye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortes, deputy colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that came to him to surrender the governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, the citizens and government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican airfield itself, and the Mexican airfield.
Bacio Cortés died in the last days after the crash of the helicopter he was driving. On board was also a secretary of the government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of the Saltillan native Bacio Cortese (committed) arrived to be handed over through the funeral service by the Mexican Air Force under the command of Major Jaime Martinez to the space where the family, his mother and his daughter, Cristina, gathered in the meantime.
Three abandoned dead bodies were found on the Cadereyta NL ship.
A few hours before the find, military officials presented to the media 11 people who had been detained in the area for crimes related to organized crime.
The bodies of three men killed by gunfire in various parts of the body and head were found on the abandoned vessel of the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
It was found on a 1.5 km road from Cadereyt to Santiaga, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved around these places noticed that the cottage with a beige-coffee fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, about three meters from a distance, they noticed the deaths of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One of the people wore a sports shirt of yellow color and a dark cotton pants and was not a shoe. Next to him was a man also lying in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few meters away was the body of another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three of them lay face-to-face toward the ground.
According to the data obtained at the sites, all three people were likely killed at another location because no bullets were found.
On the fence of the cottage were found messages addressed to one group of organized crime of the other, as well as a series of footprints, both on the building and on the doors.
11 suspects were arrested in Cadereyt
The National Defence Secretariat presented 11 people, including youths, who were members of the criminal group that operated mainly in the area of Cadereyt and which is associated with kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burials.
According to the information published during the first attempt on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros, 8 people were detained and one person was released.
Three properties and a mobile phone have been secured and confirmed to be members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
The next strike occurred on November 12 at 6 a.m., when military personnel were on patrol in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyt when he noticed cars without an SPZ and two people inside.
After stopping the car, they made an inspection and discovered one gun, a revolver and 18 rounds.
Then, on the basis of these statements, one of the accomplices in the area of La Frauda was detained on 13 November at around 14 o'clock, and when he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were accused of illegal burials in the towns of General Teran, China and Cadereyt.
The new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that keeps the country above the brink of economic disaster.
The appointed Prime Minister of Italy, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present him with a new government that will face a crisis that keeps the country above the collapse of the economic disaster that has put the entire eurozone at risk.
The presidential palace issued a report in which it announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgi Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he could form a government.
It is expected to introduce a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to create a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti completed the process of creating a government in less than three days, i.e. in a much shorter time than usual, while Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which led the debt level to an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Montim, must approve a tough package of austerity measures demanded by European leaders, the only way it will be possible to restore Italy’s entrenched credibility.
Due to market instability, interest rates from Italian BTP bonds with a ten-year maturity of 7 per cent have exceeded the level at which Greece and Ireland had to apply for a bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of Confindustria’s Italian employers’ organisation, told reporters after a meeting with Montim: “We said we would support this government very much.”
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this dire situation.
Monti’s hopes for success have increased significantly thanks to the support of PDL Silvia Berlusconi, whose crisis forced her to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelina Alfano, the secretary of the center-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant, because until now a number of its members have stood up against the government with a technocratic majority, which Monti assembles.
Parliament's support
The new Monti government must have strong support from Parliament in order to promote unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in this effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti’s failure could be a disaster.
Monti began talks on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women’s organisations.
The round of talks will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitano, who enabled a very rapid process in response to the crisis.
After a brief decline at the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi was resigning, the interest rates of Italian bondholders returned to the critical border, reacting to uncertainty as to whether the new prime minister was successful.
To save Italy, whose public debt is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 trillion, would be beyond the scope of the eurozone’s current financial reserves.
Monti said his government should remain in power until the next elections, which are scheduled for 2013, despite the general forecast, which he says give politicians time only to carry out reforms, and then announce early elections.
Monti said he would like to incorporate policies into his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to bring Italy out of the difficulties the country has come to due to financial pressure.
Political sources have said that bilateral mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicates the attempt to incorporate both government and political personality into the government.
Spaniards take part in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten exceed the limit of 50 international matches.
On the Costary side, only one of the 22 players called up to the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rica side, if we compare 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and Europe champions, the number one monthly FIFA rating, have on their account a wide range of A-class inter-selection matches, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who as the only one played 50 international matches.
This number reached last Friday in a match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the Starfleet and in the powerful clubs of the English First League, have maintained an intense activity at league championships and domestic cup and high-level matches throughout the European Cups such as the Champions League over the year.
We must also add to the previous experience of the Spanish national team in the complicated knockout matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign games from the Spanish team has on their account goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who scored last Saturday against England (lose 0-1 in London) on the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches.
Casillas will also face Costa Rica today and gain a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, Barcelona’s key player, has 106 matches on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week by UEFA along with other Spanish players who have hundreds of matches on their account, including already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and midfielder Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
Carles Puyol came close with 97 games.
Following are Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rica side and close to Michael Uman, the left wing J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az moves with 48 games and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only 5 exceeded the limit of 30 matches: Keilor Navas s 31, Randall Azofeifa s 32, Michael Barrantes s 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez s 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez s 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31) are among the top 30.
On the national side with less than 30 games, Roy Miller stands at 26, Winston Parks stands at 26, Gabriel Badilla stands at 25 and Roy Myrie stands at 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one in Costa Rica and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first game.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side it has the most stakes Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in its tour on the occasion of the celebration of 20 years of existence
“The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality.”
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that for them the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This is what the bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate 20 years of existence and will be on Sunday 20th at a unique stopover in Central America.
This day will be performed from 7:30 p.m. at the National Stadium along with the Angel group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an example of an interview whose entire transcript can be found on La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n's website.
For your Costa Rican fan, this is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The road to Costa Rica is also our dream, which is becoming a reality.
In South and Central America we are barely the second time and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a wonderful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're so happy to be able to bring you our music.
I ask myself, because they love the group here, the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensively.
What do you say to your biggest fans?
Thank you for staying with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it took us so long.
Some people talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does it put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve shown in the last 21 years have been on the horizon for several weeks.
We have performed several great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this will allow us to get into the form of a concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of friends of surfers and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. And so we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
When we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we don't have any restrictions on what we can't do.
We will try to present the best show with different songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a good and varied repertoire.
You will never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it’s partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs we’ll play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played in a long time, we focus on them and we’re also surprised because we’ll remember why we liked them so much and that we might have forgotten about it already.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that’s why I think it’s more interesting for people as well.
This tour celebrates 20 years of the art track.
When you look back, it’s hard to believe everything you’ve ever done.
Yes, that's for sure.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we'd be in a big rock band and that we'd be staying in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much has been given to us and we feel that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We are lucky to be able to look at the places we have always longed for.
We couldn't have gotten any better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group in which the greats themselves are represented.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It is surprising that when the movement arises from a group of friends, too often it does not happen.
From time to time a group is formed in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at a time.
We are proud of it and are honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play with some of them.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored that we can be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It’s also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and still have the same members after those years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which by itself is much longer than the usual duration of the band.
I think the first time we are all lucky, we are still in this world and the second time our role is played by the fact that we are constantly interested in each other.
We are all close friends and thanks to this we have managed to open up musical pathways that leave everyone with enough freedom to experiment on their own.
We trust each other, we value each other's music, and I don't think it could be any better.
Your relationship to the word of fame has not been easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it was increasingly easier to find a balance.
We try not to ride too much on tour because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come for music, you will remember that you have to respect music and what you have given to it. You must not let yourself be carried away by being famous, rock stars. This has never really been of any interest to any of us.
How do you remember the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs and at the beginning it was something great.
We’ve been a band for three years and we’ve never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating, because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we still make friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us. When I would listen to a song or watch a movie, I would laugh at it
He was an incredible person and we miss him very much.
The Las Robertas National Band will be tasked with launching the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose them as your forerunners?
Yes, the production sent us videos with a few suggestions and we liked this group the most. That's why we're curious what Las Robertas will offer live and they have to be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he adds the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influences you as a bass player?
A lot of people.
Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I could talk all night about the basics that I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge even though it is no longer in fashion?
I think we've all always felt a slight separation from the word grunge.
When I say grunge, I imagine the bands that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. And if music is still valid today, then it's something great, because it's the music that makes the band stand out and it's the music that makes it sound so loud
At first, your music had a slightly cloudy character and is now more positive.
What is behind this change?
That’s interesting because I feel like there are a few songs in the new album that are lighter to burn, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very cloudy, although they may sound positive.
At both of them, when Ed played them to me, I cried, and they're songs deep in the dark.
I think that when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from a family or a friend, these things will start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent just that to me.
I also think that you can be a happy person and still make cloudy music.
Peru:
Fujimori has been re-hospitalized due to medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss in the area of the lower extremities, his attending physician said.
72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for violating the human rights of his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including cancer of the tongue, for which he has been operated four times and is currently under the control of doctors.
MP Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Canal N television that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in three days, where they should find out why it hurts him and why he loses strength in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori could receive mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not wish it because he feels innocent.
He was four times operated on for cancer of the tongue, weighed 18 kilograms, and other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, cysts on the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the legs, the doctor named.
Fujimori has been serving a sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people who killed a murder squad of an army operating illegally in the first years of his government.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the Uruguayan president, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin on Tuesday to visit Mexico, whose goal is to achieve trade expansion between the two nations and to address the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of an extensive visit to a full meeting with representatives of politics, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the President of Uruguay.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries,” Uruguay’s presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to force Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in a dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy listed the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that the countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be expelled from the international community, which has provoked a rejected opinion from Uruguay and a consultation with the ambassador to the European Union.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world. Since January this year, the Latin American country has signed an information exchange agreement to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has been trying to make fiscal exchange agreements concrete in order to get from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 'black paper', which are countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have since 2004 concluded the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which has strengthened the exchange of goods between the two countries.
Installer is running in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of villain Bowser, but has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to all stores around the world, has been designed from the beginning to take advantage of all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console that allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
“Mario is a character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses,” Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, a press worker specializing in Nintendo in Spain, told a video game presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier" because until now successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
Nintendo said that in addition to being a 3D shot, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", the task of which is to attract less skilled users.
Once you overcome this level, you can get into the "second round" on the levels of the game, which this time are more challenging.
In addition, users can choose the real time between "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome various challenges and "not subject to optical illusions".
This new arrival of Super Maria in 3D also presupposes the return of the character to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays in the notes those who follow the saga and repeats the successful formula from the previous parts. It is that the installer of the bearded man will have to go through dangerous alternate platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in the moves, in the surroundings, in the overcoats and also among the enemies, Luigi's "player" will also appear.
Colom approved Portilla's release to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had taken steps to issue former President Alfons Portilla, who is to be held responsible in the United States for the conspiracy to wash $70 million.
Thus ends the process, which was aimed at Guatemala responding to the request of the northern country, which demands the release of Portilla to be able to prosecute him.
At the press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision is in accordance with the independence of the judiciary and executive power and that he remembers that the criminal court had already ordered the issue.
He assured that during his term of office he did not "interfer" in court decisions and allowed all the issues that got to his table.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n will be released for murder and serious harm to health and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom’s move means a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to run the trial against the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after his legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights will be guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent in the matter of bribery of 120 million at the Ministry of Defense during his presidency. This process preceded the release, but the Public Ministry withdrew and returned the case to the game.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people in a state of danger
The organization was created to help children without education, so that they did not feel at the edge of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of existence of the organization of social support of Trinijove is very important: 6,000 young people, who threatened social exclusion, got help. The organization of the whole 25 years helps them overcome difficult situations.
To this end, it is necessary to add a long hundred jobs, which have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday’s anniversary also served to present the balance within the framework of the ceremony, which took place in the former Fabra i Coats factory premises, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, without work, dealing with drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday’s meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, during the election, showed the uniform nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Arthur Mass, and his predecessor, Jordi Pujol, a former socialist education adviser, Ernest Maragall, and a former deputy mayor and current eco-socialist councilor, Ricard Goma attended the ceremony.
In the large hall of Fabra and Coats, the current Social Welfare and Family Advisor, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the Director General of Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also arrived.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that today also gives a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to today is "a good basis".
The president cited Trinijove as an example of how it is possible to fight against adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
“The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does,” he said.
There was an evacuation of a busy house, where giant parties were held.
Invaders own 11 of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday afternoon without resisting
It all points to the fact that the nightmare experienced by the 51st-century neighbors on Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people left the building yesterday afternoon voluntarily, which they illegally lived in and where they organized giant parties that woke up neighbors. They left the building from the court order and without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent the situation from repeating.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," said the administrator.
The occupants, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all electrical and partly water equipment, in addition to polishing the walls and leaving behind all kinds of waste, especially cans after alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties, which lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that by the time the building was occupied, sales had fallen by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque emphasizes that the occupants of the building made it a bad competition because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the discotheque costs 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors because of the noise. However, the problems did not cause the visitors of the discotheque, but the inhabitants of the taken house, and especially those who participated in the organized parties, the frequency and intensity of which are increasing.
The owner of the discotheque explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and have already forgiven her for nine months.
The city police also confirmed that over the past few weeks they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The chairman of the municipal People's Party (PP) group, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, last week demanded that "the building be immediately evacuated and thus end the problems of civic coexistence suffered by the neighbors and the destruction of the area".
The president of the people explained that only one floor had been blocked before the summer, but in recent months the occupants had entered all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and in one of them there was even theft.
In this regard, he added that "there is a need to end impunity and be consistent when it comes to the acts against civic responsibility that occurred in the building."
Yesterday, the city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
In 15 hours and 30 minutes, police arrived at building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being called by neighbors who saw four people enter the building.
All four of them were arrested immediately.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of the write-off of the procedure, which carries with it more than a controversy about fees
The city’s 16-hole selection process once again opens up a debate about the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the time of the largest blossoming already disappeared Corporaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-government printed several pamphlets in support of Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York's Central Park.
After the disappearance of the CMB in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the top border of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not focus on the north - south axis, but up (hora) - down (sea).
Collserola’s qualification as a natural park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with the Wildcats instead of the Yogi Bear.
This was the position until September, when the city council announced a mega competition consisting of 16 contests for the same number of entrances to Collserola.
The gate, of course, records rather the thoughts of the park.
Either this or someone's trying to put the gate on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and based on a reflection on the city, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already a topic as rotten as when two members of this old caste chosen at the meeting in the elevator give a hand.
And it was this very act that caused one of the rare concurrences between what three Barcelona architects and leading university professors think.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection process has its reasons.
According to Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, after the question of the Gulf side began, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain side", so Ildefonse Cerda's speech on green apples was not reached to the end.
“We have to take the principle that Barcelona’s biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, its great availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "gate to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as defining zones where it is possible to operate".
Modol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with experience from the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" offering "some dangers".
The danger arising from “the uncertainty that the public space project represents today” after the experience of the 1980s, which had in the Forum “its swan song”.
The first concern is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
"To define something means to take another step", that is, to move one step further.
“It is necessary to keep in mind new urban planning and planning tools, because the current (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster.”
If we focus on the question in more detail, Modol believes that the Collserola valley slope can be "considered as a park", but the Barcelona part is not, for reasons purely topographical.
Modol also recalled that there is already work done by Patronat de Collserola, who "must not end up in the trash", although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his cream that he will hit the project from the "first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of pass that allows the architects to engage in the debate, but he "doubts" that it should be precisely this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skill" to "be able to", he adds), which is necessary to
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex, because in the grounds for the selection process there is a lack of global vision of Collserola: "There were 16 selection procedures that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there would be no subsidence
This means that at least he has signed up for all 16 selection procedures.
Otherwise, the project of a single gate can refer to the concept and definition of the architect of the neighboring gate.
In his view, the city council should ensure that the zone directly above the Ronda de Dalt should provide for the entire length of the zone of equipment that would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino passes Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal, which will be released
After 72 days in prison, Cadino Red, a law enforcement official, granted his brother Mayor Monterrey's pardon in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal has spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after the legal officer of Casino Red granted him mercy before the Second Criminal Court in the district in question, which was discussing the case of extortion in which Monterrey’s brother was charged.
Following the Casino Royale attack, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a published a series of photographs and videos on which Manuel Jonas had to ask for the payment of an economic quota to allow the town hall in Monterrey to operate illegally in the gambling house.
After a public complaint, the State Prosecutor’s Office initiated a criminal prosecution against the brother of the Panistic mayor. On September 2, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then, after 4 hours spent before the Public Prosecutor's Office Agent, number 3 for property crimes was transferred to prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo, the capital of the state.
He remained in this place for the next 49 days after the second arrest order was issued and a public prosecutor denied the possibility of co-operation or organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyt Criminal Court for suspicion of extorting the owners of Casina Red for one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in prison with medium-heavy supervision because he was threatened with death.
During the process, he was allowed to stay in the urban areas of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza.
On 25 October he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, who stated that after almost two months of investigation, enough evidence was gathered to prove Jonas's guilt.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casina Red, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, presented himself to the judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region, on the basis of which he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal hearing, Ramiro Arias, a representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez if the damage had been repaired and which of the associates decided to grant the favor. But the lawyer made it clear that the name will remain hidden.
On the basis of the official document 197/2011, the legal pardon is granted to Jonas Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal. In the proceedings against him, it will not be possible to file any complaint. It is also not possible to request compensation for damages or punishment.
The court ordered the immediate release of Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n after the transfer with the legal authority around 15:50.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yanéz, arrived at the prison in San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted an official pardon and his case was postponed to the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order to release him.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come presented details of the plane crash in which the secretary of the governor, Francisco Blake, and seven others died.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of an accident investigation that killed the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people show that the helicopter hit the ground with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionysio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, said that before the launch of the aircraft, the pilot found that climate conditions allow flights.
"The parts that appear suggest that the unit has come into contact with the terrain several times, the wings have become entangled in the branches of trees 25 meters from the place where the unit has lost its corpse."
He also reported that the unit was intended for 19 people, so it met all the requirements for the transfer of personnel.
In addition, he stated that on the basis of the investigation carried out in the area of impact, no components were found on the ground.
"In the search, it was found that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the plane hit the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, met all requirements for the transport of people.
The terrain shows slopes with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment it is most important to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to a year.
Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, General Manager of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the crash, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was moving at the speed of travel and the accident occurred on a soft ascent terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident, it was a normal flight operation," he said.
At a press conference, SCT representative Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come named six key points of inquiry:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew must see on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports state the appropriate conditions at the start, in accordance with which the aircraft moves in the direction of the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico the apparent layers were clouded at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that because of the cloudy crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility as far as the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of the impact.
The collision coordinates and the last record of the helicopter from the radar agree, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the flight trajectory before the collision.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in the restricted territory:
The information we currently have at our disposal allows us to assume that the collision occurred on an equal trajectory and from the side.
The sketch of the wreckage of the plane suggests that at the time of the impact on the mainland, the helicopter was holistic.
There was no fire or explosion.
At the scene of the accident, there was no evidence to prove that there had been an explosion or a fire.
The latest results of the research show that there may have been several contacts with the solid.
During fieldwork, the remains of the aircraft were found at a height of up to 9,200 feet above sea level, the terrain is being weighed, the height of the inclination goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show footage that is likely to have broken down along the route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter could have come into contact with the country in several places.
After a careful search in the vicinity of the accident, no remains of the helicopter were found in the area larger than the area of the marking, which reinforces the assumption that the collision occurred in a state where the helicopter was still intact.
Mexico’s Institute of Health Insurance has launched a gene research that causes obesity.
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research in order to discover the gene responsible for obesity of children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research to reveal genes that cause obesity in children and young people. A study called "Genetics of Obesity in Children and Youths" will allow you to get results related to overweight.
In a report, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Research Medical Unit in Biochemistry at the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Center of the 21st Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been set up.
This team relies on the support of specialists and students of postgraduate studies from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research can also be undertaken by a wide audience, with or without permission. People can come to the participating IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where they will run tests for young people every 8 hours.
He stressed that the research started at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexico) and since October 8 this activity is also carried out at the Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt Sports Centre (East of Mexico).
As soon as data from 500 to 600 children is obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to determine the components and significance of genetics when it comes to the development of obesity, and to identify risk factors for Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on November 14, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on balance.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and the family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He pointed out that every Saturday with all participants, anthropometric measurements are carried out (weight, height, circumference of the waist), blood pressure is measured, the level of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin is determined, and genes are examined (trying to identify genes, try to identify genes).
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said this research reflects the concern of physicians over alarming increases in children’s weight.
"Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years there was only a 77% increase in obesity among boys and a 47% increase in girls. There was also a dramatic increase in overweight," said an IMSS expert.
He stated that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the assumption that the country's population differs from other populations by its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% of Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% of European and 5% of African. This fact is reflected in genes that are responsible for the emergence of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is usually explained as the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) that is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of participants is that they will receive an overall assessment of the child’s condition, which will determine whether they are experiencing any known overweight or obesity.
He noted that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and precancerous conditions.
The information is confidential so far, doctors pass it on in writing to the parents and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes that they need to make to prevent their children from getting the disease.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary way of life that means a lack of daily physical activity, a full-day sitting in front of the TV, and the use of means of transport instead of space.
Excessive weight is also caused by high caloric intake, this is the greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetic burden that is the subject of this research.
There will be no excuses in Asphalt from UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, creates modified asphalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climate conditions and temperature
If properly cared for irrigation, there would be no need to repair almost 200,000 landslides after each period of rainfall in the Valle de México metropolitan area, warned Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, a scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) from UNAM, who would have been building a dam, and would have survived until the end.
In his lecture The Technological Cause of Extinction, which he presented during the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalts with polymers, which should create a mixture having similar characteristics as asphalt, but at the same time it is growing from the same time.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, for example in some cities in the north of the country. This would improve functionality and reduce the formation of effluents.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a high molecular weight, which are called asphaltenes, and others with a low molecular weight, which are called maltenes.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in a solid state, while at low temperatures, asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day depending on weather conditions and temperature, the expert on chemical engineering pointed out.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered with a flexible slab made up of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the topmost layers is an asphalt insert, formed by small stones poured into the asphalt and then pressed.
He stressed that every stone that makes up the insert is filled with asphalt.
When passing the car or when creating pressure, it is possible for the forces in the tile to be well distributed.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, according to a chemical engineer.
He added that the last layer called a layer, made of fine stone, i.e. sand, also poured into the asphalt, will be placed on the asphalt insert.
Since this layer will come into contact with the vehicle sheaths, it must have a greater mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the carriage.
Since as part of the rigging will be exposed to a large load, the garment must have a sufficient thickness and must pay attention to the material from which it is made.
The climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. In particular, water has a great influence on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the ground is wet, the water spreads inside and it is difficult to get out, this causes softening of all layers of the tile and thus the emergence of wrinkles.
He explained that during the creation of the molds, the film of the coating will be destroyed first and only then damage to the asphalt insert occurs. However, the damage does not occur at one point, but it is a slow process that should be stopped already at the first signs with the help of appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of bulges, and therefore the thickness of each layer of tiles must correspond to the load of vehicles and must ensure that this load can not exceed the load.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that when it comes to asphalt, a lot of work is still waiting for us and research is at the beginning. For example, there are asphalt emulsions, which are already available in other countries on the market and allow us to easily repair molds without having to use them.
What was missing from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analyses of factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna did not win the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle thus wins the 14th title of the first multi-miss.
Valle del Cauca again failed to reach the crown of Miss Colombia.
Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to settle for feeling on the podium of the winner, gaining a silver crown and a scarf, on the basis of which she became the new first multi-miss Colombia.

A question that many people ask themselves. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of a great favorite, who in all previous rounds showed that she has to become the new Miss Colombia, and not for free became the Royal Police and the Most Beautiful face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved, for example, by Miss Talian Vargas or by Natalia Navarro.
One of the key factors that the jury decided to name her only the First Multi-Miss is the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question: "Which book did you like the most and why?" by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez from the literary editor Leamos.
In response to the candidate’s question, she said:
"I read a lot. I very much believe in the role of literature, I think it is one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me most in my childhood was "The Little Prince", a very deep book.
Currently I am reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature that we should all know. And today I have with me a book by Irene Nemirovski, Russian authors. It is a wonderful book called "El dedor ar".
However, this answer was not liked because of the term "culturalization" and, secondly, because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned noticed.
At the end of the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and delighted with the result: “The world is wise, what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read, if you can. The little prince is a wonderful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the position of the favorite.
The Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> journalist pointed out that the fact that the candidate was the most popular, most celebrated from the beginning and the one who took all the previous prizes (Gastronomic challenge Oster, the title of public for the best artistic dress and the Queen's mother), aroused the envy of the others, the waiter, the waiter, the waiter.
It was evident during the first presentation of the swims at Hilton Beach and during two previews before the final crowning.
Although it shone on both of them, it was known that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm that the representatives of Magdalena and Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for Canal RCN’s “Like Home” program, believes that Melinda’s winning the first multi-miss title confirms the fact that a candidate who won the most titles in the competition does not eventually leave with the crown of the queen.
In addition, in recent days, Valle had a rather insensitive attitude towards the media, and it did not pay him.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Just two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said she was looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In the Miss Colombia competition, beauty alone is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feeling. It is important that candidates even before entering the competition, be involved in such projects."
It is also speculated that Valle's candidate lost points due to the lack of her background and fibrosis, which was visible on the buttocks. But this is completely contrary to the jury verdict, which chose her Miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest active body, the management
Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco, who prepares for the Queen, admits that Melina didn’t have the best body, that there were better girls here, “but the problems with the ass fibrosis, which in my opinion was not too noticeable, took her points until the last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos newspaper believes that a native of Valle made a mistake when she underwent several surgical procedures.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but they didn't succeed in Valle.
The body has never been her strong side and here she has chosen her tax.”
Due to this award, which was awarded for the first time by the National Assembly of Beauty, after a swimsuit screening, there was a cruel prediction that was fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melin<0xC4><0x97> had given her, so that he did not have to give her the best in the end.
Whether it’s true or not, it’s certain that Melina has started the year of her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named the National Competition itself.
However, it is recorded in history as one of the queens, who, despite the crushing success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
This was the work of a Cali resident who identified the death of Alfons Cana.
An expert on fingerprints from Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the death of "Alfons Cana".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4 last year, a CTI fingerprint expert in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of Farc's supreme leader: "Alfonse Cana", by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working for the CTI department, this week’s series was for Eleazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a man from Puerta Tejada, who has worked in the field of judicial research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked at a town hall in Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where he often had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the dead were, which needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle and after taking the relevant courses, he began specializing in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin friction, i.e. hand and foot.
In the week when the operation was carried out against the aforementioned Alfonso Canov, they told Eleazar to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he went to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two dead people and that one of them is suspected to be the man who led the world's oldest guerilla, so he was asked to take a fingerprint card from Guillermo Leon Saenz (his real name).
However, when he came with the investigating team to the place where the corpse was located, he didn't recognize it because of the physical appearance. He looked completely different than in the media.
He had no beards, he was dressed as a villager in a given area, without glasses, much slimmer.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with Galton's magnifying glass, ink and transplantator and light, Eleazar began to compare the dactyl records of the dead with the records from the card.
His eyes did not disappoint: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was commissioned to confirm to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, whether it was really the Supreme Commander of the FARC.
Searching for tracks
The recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos presented to Eleazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez at the press conference of the operational service against "Cano" is very important for the Dactyloscope of Sis<0xC3><0xAD>n de Cali.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision of criminal acts.
In addition to identifying the dead, these people assist in investigating crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When caught, many offenders present false documents or do not have any papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints off and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that in the event of an injury, he had to remove a piece of the house wall in the house, because the thief relied on this place to pull out a vault full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not meant to be taken, but in this case we were able to get the print of the entire hand and identify the offender who took part in several thefts," he said.
Fingerprints can also confirm or refute suspicions in the event of a murder.
They recently found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
Based on the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder, and the print on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it cannot be 100% confirmed that he was indeed a murderer, it is obvious that he appeared on the crime scene.
The CTI fingerprint expert explained that the fingerprints "are removed from the objects using chemical or physical reactive substances."
When it appears, a transplantator or tape is used for their removal.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of delinquents, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians at the moment, whose data is not being reported anywhere,” said a CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as it appears in the CSI television program.
Like everything that is falling apart, there is no gold, not everything that you touch remains traces.
However, if it can be used, a relevant comparison must be made.
'Fighting' Protests in New York
Hundreds of protesters marched in the Zuccotti square, where they wanted to settle.
A large part of them waited for the order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked a New York representative on Tuesday when they tried to get back to Manhattan Square by court order, from where they were taken in the morning, and then tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of protesters rushed to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get there thanks to a court order that allows the "burnt-out" to return to the scene. The second part of the movement responded to the purge by taking the park to the north of the city, where the next detention took place.
“If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and we will continue in the legal battle with the aim of returning to Zuccotti, both through the assembly and through peaceful demonstrations,” said one of the spokespersons of the movement, “Let’s Siege Wall Street.”
Bray clarified that the response of the “inflicted” to the evacuation of the camp, ordered by the mayor of New York himself, Michael Bloomberg, had only reached the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent removal of the place and allowing the protesters to stand there.
In addition, they took another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the lighthouse grounds at Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and detained some protesters. Bray did not know the exact number, but he said he saw that the ties were also imposed on some journalists.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the site. A delegation of religious representatives has also come to express their support and also try to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square, which is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected, which should take place on Tuesday, and during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters even distributed and distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to members who were guarding the square, prompting "some small clashes," said Bray, who denounced the fact that some police protesters were there.
The court order prohibits authorities from deporting members of the “Occupy Wall Street” movement or using “laws that were published after the ban began, or prohibiting protesters from accessing the park with shops or other places they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this court order, the city has halted the reopening of the public space and protesters have warned that local laws do not allow them to return tents and sleepers.
The city's highest representative personally defended the morning evacuation of the Zuccotti square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and approached because the protesters "violated the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it had become “a place where people did not go to protest, but to break the law and in some cases hurt others” because “some shops received threatening letters” and “neighbors feared for their quality of life.”
“The morning purge was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to keep financial interests at the expense of the American working people,” a spokesman for the movement, which accused the mayor of “not respecting freedom of expression.”
Representatives of the "Occupy Wall Street" movement also said they planned to organize "great events" on Thursday in cooperation with community and professional organizations to commemorate the two months following the protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson to present Miss Mary on a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a swimmer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of year-old musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be Miss Mary on a special Canadian Christmas TV show.
CTV's private television station today announced that Anderson, along with sentimental singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on Dec. 1 and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a television show in which Anderson, also known from online home pornographic footage, appears with her ex-husband, the engine "M<0xC3><0xB6>tley Cr<0xC3><0xBC>e", Tommy Lee, as Miss Maria holding a doll depicting Je<0xC5><0xBC>i in the slender dolls.
As Joseph appears on the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently acted as a moderator on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a Canadian singer Bublé will appear on a Christmas special broadcast in late March in Buenos Aires with Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian "the fox" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is back to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, thus ending the period of declines that began in March
Since March last year, Japan’s economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has escalated into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government calculated the material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global situation, is well-adjusted.
After three quarters of declines, the value of GDP between July and September came to such a position that it was possible to turn the page with definitive validity: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
In addition, the results of the second quarter - for Japan the tax year starts in March 2012 - predict the highest growth rate compared to the period January to March 2010.
Revival can be explained in part by the purchase of machines that are necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
The companies increased their investments by 1.1%, spending decreased by 0.9% compared to the period January to March. This is the first decrease after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy stems solely from the impulse that forces us to use the crisis to get out of it, or to restore infrastructure, and it is to use the lack of it to start from scratch.
Japan has woken up. Especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable has increased by 1%, thanks to increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The New Stigma
Tokyu has taken over the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "save values" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the worrying forecasts of the US. It is a privilege, but at the same time a great burden.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony accounted for their weak results in July until the yen rate in September.
While markets continue to encircle the EU’s border countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government is cautious.
“We must pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen,” said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And, in fact, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has clarified that most member countries showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts volatility in the world economy, has shown that the economy of the main powers is slowing down.
It fell by four tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone has even reached below the average of 100, reaching up to 99.13 points.
Athens is once again spreading uncertainty
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written pledge
With the rapid and risky border guarantees and the uncertainty that has once again prevailed, Greece is becoming increasingly entangled in a maze that is leading to the outcome of a major debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that the “shoda” of the new transitional Greek government is given more of the demands of Brussels than the true conviction of political forces is beginning to confirm.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period he received in his appointment will probably not be short for their application, the president of the conservative party of the New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, has said that the new opposition
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the summit of October 26," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow by voting on the government's trust.
The package with 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the Samaras message does not clarify any doubts about his position: “We committed to helping the transitional government, but we did not commit to anything else.”
In his speech to the EU and the IMF, the president of the Conservatives went a little further. These organisations are to unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, but at the same time he stated that he will not support and sign any commitments regarding the implementation of the austerity measures.
The European Commission, already outraged by the impact that caused Papandreo’s players with a referendum, stressed yesterday that its demands are insurmountable: it does not block any aid unless the new government and the representatives of the main parties sign the “most important letter of the letter” and the letter of the letter reads:
A spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens and will negotiate with the new government about "what it needs to pay for the sixth part" 8 billion.
The Greek squid has a moment to go.
Queen Sofia: “There are tools for progress and hope”
The Queen highlights Spain’s position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position at the global level in terms of microfinance".
The Queen of Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, the country has become the second donor of the planet when it comes to this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is that it is a tool of social progress, justice and hope for the future of the people.
The Queen yesterday launched the 5th Global Microloan Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this kind of operation "is absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, which the UN has set for the coming year, will aim to achieve by 2015.
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly", stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure that the hatchings and hatchings for the hatching of the hatches are the most
“We’ve already achieved a lot” and “a lot of challenge is still ahead of us.”
The Microloans Summit is to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports the “fundamental goals”.
Her Majesty explained that the goal is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to reach the poverty line under which they currently live.
The concept of microloans has spread to Spain and to other countries of the world after "the pioneer of the idea of Muhammad Yunus set out on this journey", the Queen said, adding that it was "an act of justice and necessary recognition".
The father of this instrument described her as "a wonderful idealist who set out on the road to combating poverty." She became acquainted with his work 15 years ago when she set out to Bangladesh to get acquainted directly on the spot with his loan policy.
After this experience followed another. The first global summit in Washington and other meetings such as in the Ivory Coast in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings I was able to see a constant development," explained the queen, who, thanks to her project, sneezing at the
Queen Sophie ended her performance by inviting participants to engage in discussions and search for a solution, thus allowing them to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Foreign Minister, Trinidad Jiménez, said that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that all democratic states must follow.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with the period of the ballooning, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent a “serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty,” and now more than ever the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to become the victim of poverty.
For Spain, microloan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, welcomed the success, which celebrates the concept based on giving confidence to the people to whom everyone else closes the door. Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva welcomed the participants in the duchy, who
The CDU proposes to elect a European president on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress was held in Leipzig on Monday, 14 November, without any serious difficulties for Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party Angela Merkel.
The question of Europe's future on the programme was not originally, but it did not happen until autumn, especially to please the members of the parties who consider the government's policy today towards the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow towards Italy to be lax.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission, submitted by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.
A few minutes of ovation comes to the end of Angela Merkel’s speech, and a few hours later Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>ubla, a very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the chancellor of Europe, "the time for change has come".
This could be expressed by changes in the Lisbon Treaty that would strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of the general suffrage law.
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will agree quickly on this revolutionary step: the UK is opposed and the CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same stance as well.
But the direction is fixed.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to assess the weight of each country on the Board of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in a strengthening of Germany’s weight.
Led by the concern to calm the climate inside her party, the chancellor made several references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she did not try to get the congress talks about "small" European states or about states that are in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant N<0xC4><0x9B><0xC4><0x9B>.
Although the proposal on Europe is devoted to one paragraph of the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Just indirectly.
When she recalled that two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Lipska.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What constitutes fraud in the case of incapacity for work?
After the support, the UMP party and the government launch an offensive against the incapacity for work.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, December 15, and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will speak on the theme of the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity since 2007.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased severity, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on joblessness.
First of all, because of budget savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of work incapacity on employees of the private sector before they begin to receive support in the disease.
Clearly, without the company’s consent, an employee who is ill would have lost four days of wages, i.e. at least 15% of their monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to the Les Echos, could bring in 280 million euros.
And also measures that would be accompanied by other measures of symbolic reach: to give state employees one day of unfettered incapacity for work (until now they have no incapacity versus three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the right-wing majority is also pushing the topic of fraud, this time focused on workplace-related abuses.
"The controls will be much more extensive and, moreover, if you are caught, you will return," Xavier Bertrand said in an interview with RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear to be somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about the injustices in the workplace.
These have, in fact, been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and of the political pressure that has borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s start with a few official numbers.
According to Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million of daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Care, in 2008 they represented a daily allowance with their <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion 5% expenditure in health care.
Of this amount, 46% were related to maternity contributions and work injuries, and 54% were related to work disabilities, i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
Only 2.5% of the cost of healthcare.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting group, in 2010, France had an average of 14.5 days of work incapacity versus 17.8 days in 2009.
The average that conceals certain deviations: another survey published in 2007 on the pages dealing with job opportunities at Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed replied that they had not chosen a day of work.
Another study, this time conducted by health insurance institutions, states that in 2010 37.8% of the work incapacity was shorter than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months, and 11% lasted longer.
When we compare them to their European neighbours, French employees are no more prone than elsewhere to incapacity for work.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, total absences (for health reasons or not) ranged in France between 10% and 11.8% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 18% in Great Britain, and 18% in Great Britain.
Fraud in the workplace is only a very small part of working in black.
When it comes to fraud, these are only a small amount.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks aimed at job incapacity for more than 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM found that, for 1.5 million checks, 13.8% of the 285,000 were carried out due to short-term incapacity for "unauthorised or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacity for more than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadapted or unauthorised" were counted on 1.2 million controls, i.e. 132 000.
Thus, a total of 169,000 "unauthorized" cases for several million employees who had a work disability.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing work in black.
According to UMP Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would amount to between EUR 9 and 15 billion missing in the choice of tax for a year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke to parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his government by unity will not be enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to re-establish our economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new rescue budget plan," the head of government said in his first public speech at the start of the parliamentary vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the Eurozone is at stake, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the country’s public deficit will be “about 9%” of gross domestic product from now to the end of the year after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rights Rejects New Savings Measures
On Monday, right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed his support for the already approved measure in order to try to escape the debt crisis, but noted that his party does not commit to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hands for any new measures," Samaras said at a meeting with a member of parliament on his side of the New Democracy.
We have agreed to the goals of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Mr Ollim Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU will not unlock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties that support the envisaged measure, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was not enough and that he would not support it.
We need to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says the committee of experts
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians are denied death.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Canadian society is living with the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and make a decision in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report of the Royal Canadian Society, which was attended by six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Commission recommends that the Government change criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if such an option appears to be necessary for a patient considered competent to make such a decision.
At the beginning, experts cite a recent survey by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “medication of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death.”
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in the province of Quebec this figure is highest with 86% of hospital deaths.
As for the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide does not want to change anything.
According to experts who have also taken control of all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalization causes any abuse in the application, i.e., in the practice of euthanasia or will not assist in self-incrimination.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed at a teleconference yesterday more than a number of cases of these outbreaks in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
Euthanasia is also being carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
“Assisted suicide is also being carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are prone to euthanasia
According to a 2010 survey conducted by the Angus Reid Forum, 85% of Canadians have already expressed themselves in favour of euthanasia because they believe it will allow people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the lives of older or disabled people have a lower price.
When it comes to people who practice assisted suicide, 41% of respondents say they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or interrupting patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose in the list of their recommendations that criminal law should state that a withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requires that expert doctors be trained to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their lives without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the matter of palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final sedation already widely used in Canadian medical facilities, the Commission calls for it to be considered at a time when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain, euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Restrictions of other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Canadian Society.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, called the position of experts-signators of the report "extreme", among other things, because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the sick in the final phase.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 could ask to help him commit suicide,” says Pierre Deschamps, who was just studying the summary reports yesterday.
Deschamps also underscores that it looks like the authors of the report are building a person’s autonomy over all the other values that make up the social fabric of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she described as a "manifest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Canadian Society herself, is in particular questioning the data of the report regarding the absence of doubt in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the U.S. state of Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Resign
Dama<0xC5><0xA1>ek talks about "conspiracy"
Syria is becoming more and more isolated.
Bashar al-Assad’s supporters demonstrated in front of the Foreign Ministry yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria by President Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, is resisting them and talking about a “conspiracy” against his country, intensified.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, a neighboring Syria, seized a position in favor of President Assad’s departure.
Jordan’s King Abdallah II was the first Arab state ruler to call on President Bashar al-Assad to go to Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the regime’s military forces were killed.
“If Bashar had his country’s interests at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life,” Jordan’s King said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Ahmet Davutoglu, the head of Turkish diplomacy, argued that the efforts to mediate with the Syrian regime, which had been in business since the beginning of the year, had not been crowned with success.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and are unable to satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to neighboring Syria, which Turkey is increasingly applying a tougher line to.
The United States was pleased to "strengthen the consensus against Assad and the unfair conduct of the Syrian regime" after the Arab League and the European Union's decision.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries such as Turkey are increasingly using a harsher tone" against the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces were killed in Deraa in southern Syria.
According to this non-governmental organization, two other civilians "were killed in shelling and concentrated shootings from heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar" in the Homs region.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country “went on its way out of the crisis”.
At the same time, he also reacted strongly to the League of Arab States' decision to suspend Damascus' membership, which he said was a "dangerous step".
"Syria will not bow down," he said, adding that "the plots against Syria will not succeed."
Following his decision to suspend Syria’s membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering a “civilian protection mechanism” and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also favoured by the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said was "paranoid."
A new special meeting of the League is called for tomorrow in Rabat to draw up an opinion on the plan to resolve the crisis, which was decided on December 2, and which envisaged in particular the withdrawal of armies from cities stricken by riots and the release of prisoners.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League's decision "mistakeable" yesterday, while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, but fully backed up support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy (country)
Monti demands time and sacrifice after Italy
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for some time to form his team and start implementing a program that would include "victims" in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
Yesterday, the former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties before meeting with representatives of experts and employers today.
It should set up a relatively narrow cabinet composed of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke about an important program with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the designated Prime Minister.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament on Friday to express confidence to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti presenting a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked for time.
In "democracy is on time" when it comes to the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed, adding that he is "certain that markets will be patient and understanding".
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concerns resurfaced after the unexpected September industrial decline in the euro area.
The appointed prime minister is expected to form a team of technocrats in particular, although he stressed that he would also like to adopt "politics".
He expressed confidence that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next election.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranc Fini, the new government will gain confidence in parliament by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised that he would act with extraordinary urgency and with the aim of making Italy “a strong member” of Europe again.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn’s spokesman said: “Even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy is not changing.”
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its target, which is balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
The head of Confindustria’s trade union, Emma Marcegaglio, who met with Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy “because a country that does not show growth cannot meet deficit parameters”.
Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his professional knowledge and independence, "professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the introductions, "a challenge to seriousness" and "another Italy", represents for Italy "an epochal change" after 17 years of "berlusconism".
A great unknown will be the time of his team's life.
President Napolitano would like to secure early elections, as Italy must place state bonds worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 billion by April 2012.
The Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator for nuclear weapons, the U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risks said on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this UN agency.
Last week, the MAAE said it was "seriously concerned" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, a widely sourced from the MAAE documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) had been working for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet Military Research Center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he had to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by means of explosives.
In 1989 or 1991, he had to leave the center to start a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company should have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he worked on the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the MAAE recalls "clear data that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on the work of a foreign specialist, who not only knew this method well, but who - as one Member State informed the Agency - worked on the program during the course of a substantial part of his career.
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes Rise by 50 Percent
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence declined slightly or rose slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e., 49% increase versus the 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% increase in total violence against Jews, and a 14% increase in the number of crimes against Jews and the overall increase in crime.
The total number of “hate crimes” rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After the death in 2009, it is disconcerting to see these criminal acts and crimes rise again,” Human Rights First said in a statement, adding that “an increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant.”
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, a senior member of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these atrocities,” he adds, adding that this could be done by improving police reports of “hateful criminal acts.”
"Hate crime" in U.S. federal law is the legacy of a period of civil rights struggle.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now even sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and looks more like Facebook
The page providing the microblogging service Twitter made changes to its design on Monday to allow its users to watch the activity of followers, somewhat similar to its Facebook service.
New "Activity" and "Name" offers allow you to better and directly know the actions of other people who are following you or the people whose responses you are following ("tweets").
This lets you know whether they allow you to watch posts, whether they sign in to new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August at a small percentage of users" before it was expanded across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its lack of instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated spread of someone else’s post, follow friday to recommend following another user) making the happiness of the initiates, opens up thus a wider public with a more comparable Facebook handle.
On the network, users immediately in their "tweets" assess the importance of this innovation differently.
“It’s unnecessary, it takes a lot of places and it’s too much like Facebook,” <0x40>jemb123 writes.
“Activity will help me better track some of the elements of my Twitter,” <0x40>dannykronstrom wrote.
Austria-Hungary
the inclusion of a golden rule on a balanced budget in the Constitution
The government of a large coalition of social democrats and Christian democrats, which is in power in Austria, on Tuesday decided to write a "golden rule" of fiscal policy into the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and avoid the possible reduction of the budget.
It was the Social-Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of the council of ministers in a situation where the Austrian public debt is 74.6% high above the criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty at a maximum of 60%, but much lower than the debt.
“If Austria’s solvency had been reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion in interest every year,” said Michael Spindelegger, a multi-canceller and foreign minister.
Austria thus follows up on the request of the Eurozone summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State or Government strongly called for a reduction of the public deficit and a balance of public accounts to be entered in the Constitution or into the Constitution by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and starting in 2017, the federal state's public structural deficit will not be able to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the bulk of the country, as a whole, will not be able to exceed 0.35% of GDP.
The aim is to get public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty over the period 2020/21.
Strong only
Node threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if they were to only continue to strengthen.
"We're going to hit, as we did last time, if we find out too much inconsistency" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to the historical values that the Japanese authorities forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo was selling yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which has only recently surpassed the record against the dollar in force since 1945.
But only since then has there been a steady surge in back-up purchases of investors who see it as a "safe harbor" in the uncertain times of the world's economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
On Tuesday, the dollar again fell below 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic threshold of 105 yen to near the level that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar had a value of around 120 yen and the euro had more than 160 yen.
This flare-up of the Japanese currency damages the island’s exports as it irritates the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of returns made by Japanese companies from abroad when they convert them into domestic currencies.
"Japan is recovering" from the damage caused by the March earthquake and the wave of tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the north-east of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who is worried that this irritation will not kill an egg of brittle oats.
The world’s third economic power restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter) for the first time in a year thanks to a survey of export growth and consumption by households affected by disaster.
But the prime minister ruled that the high value of it did not reflect the "national economy of Japan".
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Central Bank of Japan (BOJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday to take all possible measures leading to weakening it.
But the institution's multi-governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that BoJ had previously taken "appropriate measures" to suggest that no further currency weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Institute for securities issuance increased its purchases of state treasury bonds by 5 billion yen (47 billion euros) and increased to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) a ceiling of the amount dedicated to the purchases of various securities with the aim of repaying.
Eurozone:
The rates are rising, the storms are failing
The risk of a debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better numbers of growth in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
European stock markets still worried about the stability of the euro area are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris in 10 hours the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Index Dax in Frankfurt is losing 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"With new tensions surrounding the euro area's troubled borrowings, the stock markets around the world are still only making part of the recent gains," he said.
“Nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of infection,” Terry Pratt, a broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The stock market in Tokyo closed down by 0.7%, which suffered due to concerns by market participants about Europe's ability to cope with the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes focused on Europe and the exchange will continue only in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This re-launch of uncertainty about the future of the euro area is damaging the currency itself, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 o’clock, the European currency has a value of $1,3570 when it declines by 0.4%.
According to brokers, the currency collapsed after the CDU party, Chancellor Angela Merkel, at her congress on Monday, accepted a proposal to exit the eurozone for countries that are in trouble without therefore having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond the limit of 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very alarming level.
This morning, Tuesday, the yield of Italian ten-year bonds reaches 6.85% and the yield of Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of South European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, called for time in the markets to be able to correct the situation in Italy threatened by the poisoning caused by the amount of her debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October will be the “main task” of his government.
Spain is once again at the forefront of the markets when the country's parliamentary elections are held on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("spread") between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new historical maximum.
Expected growth rates in the euro area
Statistics show that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, mainly due to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than the expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised the number down in the second quarter to a decline of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And it's actually the fourth quarter that worries the economy the most.
For its part, during the same period, Germany recorded a growth of 0.5%.
The first projections across the euro area are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over the dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term disagreements or emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are explored.
The French have to base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development will trigger a doubling of demand for electricity by 2050 if we don’t want a significant part of the world’s population to get rid of important parts of life.
At the same time, it will be necessary to face the shortage of fossil fuels in order to continue to produce electricity, and we cannot forget the necessary need to reduce the emissions of the greenhouse gases in order to fight against climate change, which is the environmental problem in our country.
The accident in Fukushima does not affect any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case in Belgium, which is undermining its decision to find another source capable of replacing itself, nor is Switzerland, which considers it appropriate to build only a power plant of the last generation.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by rebuilding the construction of a power plant interrupted by the accident of the Three Mile Island power plant.
If a German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, reality rejects it.
The choice of Berlin will be manifested by the irradiation of the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a rapid increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of power plants for natural gas and coal.
We will feel all these unpleasant effects within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves us to think about it.
The European champion in wind power plants, from which 30% of its electricity is taken away, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, because of which the CO2 emissions and prices of Danish electricity are higher by 65%, or 50%, respectively, than the European ones.
On the other hand, thanks to the change in our energy policy, our neighboring electricity bill will pay 40% higher than the payment of French households.
While in the globalised economy, energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and guaranteeing the maintenance of industry in the national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would lead to a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make an illusory beautiful statement about the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, as well as it does not fundamentally oppose this energy, as public opinion polls show.
Recall that the energy policy of our country has enabled the sector to be built with 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 additional jobs.
The highly-exporting sector is attracting a large number of small and medium-sized specialized enterprises to the international markets, creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would have sacrificed a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have cost the country <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion a year for the export of nuclear equipment and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to function for 60 years while the fall of its manufacturer was planned?
In solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for the production of energy, even if there is no devilish one.
The development of equipment producing low CO2 emissions, nuclear equipment and equipment using renewable energy sources by the French industrial group AREVA testifies to the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear power, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent oversight of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of blood safety.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
The only thing in Three Mile Island happened under normal operating conditions and remained without human sacrifice and consequences for the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama caused the concept of a reactor and unforgivable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, it seems that some forget that the accident was the result of two unprecedented natural disasters that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take the lessons from this accident just as it did with the two previous ones.
The result of this step and cooperation between the French and German authorities dealing with nuclear safety, operators and constructors is that an EPR reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all those who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to AREVA’s and EDF’s competitors and freeing up the way to empower the leaders in the field.
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations control the debate so crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance?
The immigration policy pursued by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from a variety of points of view - the paucity of police, courts, and the administration of the rigged policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "human rights country" that France boasts.
Recently, it was administrative harassment, the object of which was foreign students, which became topical when the interior minister (see the letter Libération of 23 May) declared that France “does not need foreign talents, carpenters and waitresses”.
But so far, it has rarely been discussed from an economic point of view.
It must be said that there is quite a broad consensus between the left and the right in this area.
On the right, in 1976, Jacques Chirac made a statement that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million migrant workers" and on the left, Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "will not accept the whole world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, fear of the invasion of hordes of Polish installers in French territory was shared right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we are willing to give to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande confines himself to banality when he states that joint development will allow us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall, in his recently published paper on the topic of migration synthesis (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, p.
Restricting immigration undermines growth and harms employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those who are less qualified, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are far more complementary than substitutes for French employees by performing jobs in sectors with a shortage of employees.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not attract French employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer places.
Positive impact on wages
Just like a surgeon will have trouble working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between the French and migrants cause the arrivals of immigrants to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% will lead to a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And yet it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among U.S. Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries on average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that in Germany, one immigrant who enters at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (receipt minus expenditure) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 in public budgets throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his mandate, expressed a desire to achieve a missing percentage of growth with "decent teeth".
The mentioned teeth used to repel immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and also very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, even though it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced during the 20th century the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonnade in Portugal.
Some people might have believed that in order for democracy to triumph over its enemies definitively, it would be enough to make a choice and make it in the most direct way possible.
However, it is already known from Napoleon that it was easy to think.
General suffrage, even though it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become a “tool of restraint,” as Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of the department and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is exactly the same since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
Acknowledging the error of the Greek referendum type yes-no will have in this direction the value of double disclosure: the disclosure of the necessity of a great return of political power, but also the disclosure of a disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be thought out in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic party have shifted today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot gain anything if we demand a number of national referendums organised as needed and disorganized.
Bianco exposed to a European absolutist monarch or a jump with his legs tied to an empty nationalistic depth: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want the knives of the guillotine, but the common, full, peaceful and uninterrupted performance of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor would we know where to stop counting - because the crisis is in Europe.
Indeed, it is the whole of Europe that is bowing to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its inability and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are troubled by the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
There is an urgent need to return to the management of the European project of democratic sovereignty.
For only together will the Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of market governments and prepare the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will presuppose decisions at European level that will not be able to be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After fighting against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors for a long time, everyone today is calling for a strong European economic government.
A bet.
But to think without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be a new madness and a new blind alley.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" a republican.
A revolution in the interests of this could not be enough.
This lesson goes on.
We must build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This can only be done by building Europe a more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Uncontacted" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the World Chip Card Fair will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 should end by increasing the global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM-card phones) by 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most portable is the contactless technology segment, which allows you to pay in bulk or arrange purchases by simply bringing the card closer to the reader.
This year, 460 million chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6,925 million cards).
After spending a long time in APEC, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards were issued.
But the big business chains work for two.
Carrefour has released 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
In order to qualify for a higher rate of speed, it is necessary for the bank to equip its clients from now on.
“Two large French companies have committed to systematically distribute a contactless bank card to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first step towards a means of payment of the future: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to carry out transactions today is equipped with only a small number of devices.
"They've picked up the delay."
"But their real breakthrough should happen in the next year."
“For 2012, we estimate their worldwide sales to 80 to 120 million units,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already getting ready.
Crédit agricole Bank announced yesterday the launch of a test carried out in the city of Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
The iPhone devices of approximately 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société générale announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its customers to pay by mobile phone without touch.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Sahrawi terror front heading from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-term suspicion that there are alliances with the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram is confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria had "been assured" of this.
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a lot of cooperation between them," he said, without further clarification.
Paris seems to have a similar analysis.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two French men in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After AQMI members were abducted from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation carried out by French special forces.
In the aftermath of the raid, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phones with chips belonging to the terrorists.
The Terrorism Unit
The analysis of the calls leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has long been living in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria that is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a person who is said to be close to her.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect is enjoying external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active,” said Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which now include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices in the same manner of execution as the devices used by AQMI.
The international community led by Washington has since developed pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long considered the group a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
A quick success.
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school, and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which means "Western education is sin" in Haoussa language, approves the establishment of the Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection has a rapid success.
The sect is politicizing itself and demanding strict observance of Sharia Islamic law, while its adherents begin a fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars, and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram’s supporters became extremely active and began massing their attacks against police stations.
The government’s response is, as usual, the same.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, the founder of the sect, is arrested and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and abandoning its position in the north.
At Christmas 2010 he carried out an assassination in Jos, killing 80 people, followed by another in the capital Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks the police command in his first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is supposed to lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, from now on worries all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda of Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and the games and Somalis from the Al-Shabab movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé said that France is in a state of emergency and is ready to "transmit all information".
The World According to Candidates for President
In matters relating to China, Iran, or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry advance in simplification and ignorance.
Can a weakened America manage the world through simple or even simplistic ideas?
When it comes to presidential candidates, voters can think about it.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating bold statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which is already a traditionally strong point for Republicans.
Often, unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or Israel’s help merge.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the Republican "Grand Old Party" nomination race, threatened to call the Chinese before the World Trade Organization and accuse them of "manipulation with their currency", which is a major topic in America's migration-ridden agenda.
The worse, if this must include the start of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has nearly slumped into a stance that “cools” emotions.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who is in the last place in the election estimates, remains unobservable.
In the image of President Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop his nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'm going to imprison Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase Israel’s military assistance, accusing Obama of disappointing his responsibilities towards this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows the embarrassing ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against China's military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capabilities" - a clearly unknown fact that China has owned a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Caine, Perry and another candidate, Michele Bachmann.
All of them are far from being Republican candidate John McCain in 2008, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and yet won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They underline the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the inexhaustible departure of the "boys" from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thereby assign him a label of the weak.
But the attack is not easy.
The population is assessing President Obama’s national security policy, which removed Ben Ladin, rather positively.
From Iraq, he has no confidence in military interventions that lead to escalation.
And with the argument that America needs to be reconstructed economically in order to resuscitate its leadership position, Obama is taking a better place.
Nord Stream, the new port of entry of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream long-distance gas pipeline connecting Eastern Europe directly to Russia and led to the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to function.
They must supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended last Tuesday’s inauguration of Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together to control the valve that controls Russian gas entering the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas will flow into Western Europe each year with the first pipeline of 1,224 km connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Commonwealth of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The second pipeline, to be completed at the end of 2012, will allow a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas to be delivered, which is an amount equal to the entire French consumption.
And it is already possible to build a third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the early completion of this huge building is a victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested against the project.
Nord Stream will in fact be able to deliver gas directly to Germany without being driven across the country by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At times, these two countries are losing their power somewhat: the possibility of pressing Russia with threats to close its access to Western European markets becomes more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed this most strongly when it did not dare to compare the Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
That is to say, it is a politically sensitive issue.
Western Europe, with its support for this Russian project, has gained greater confidence in its purchases.
But this is at the cost of weakening Europe’s energy, as the project has created gaps between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Just five years ago, Russia succeeded in pursuing its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries with high gas consumption, the bearings of which are nearing their end.
“This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new pipeline that organically connects us,” Fillon said at the opening ceremony of the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom’s leading representatives present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas port.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an important technical step.
The subsea pipe is made of steel fitted with a concrete cladding to be protected from the anchors of marine vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
“For their safety, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed,” said Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures to protect fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing as much as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted anywhere by valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but it was rejected by the project manager, when the Swedes were only reluctant to see Russian state society continue to sit on their shores.
“In the event of a failure, we will stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute,” explains Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
In case of gas tightness contained in the gas duct, it escapes into the air.
But this case is considered to be unlikely to the builder, because the shafts were designed so that the impermanence occurred once every 100,000 years.
The state of the pipeline is controlled from the outside by an underwater robot drawn by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This tobacco-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced into the pipe and is pressed by gas.
The target will provide accurate information on possible deformations of metal parts over the entire three-day journey at a speed of 3 m/s.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without the need for any minor repairs.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the target.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom remains in the lead, holding a 51% stake.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is based in the city of Zoug in Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased all of its gas transport capacity to Gazprom for a five-year contract that could be renewed.
“Gazprom will benefit from the overall capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported in any way,” explains Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% of the shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work should reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for both pipes.
For the GDF Suez Group, the investment costs amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will be reimbursed, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy coast with pine forests.
The valves at a height of 4.5 meters form a gas outlet.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has received one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When the full capacity is reached, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - Brand Notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to bring again the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, the hours spent writing in the light of candles.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangle boards and its leaves sent white as if by the time they were old.
The book of Moleskine, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is taking on the introduction of a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (imitation of the skin), which is used, for example, to adjust the surface of the armrests.
This type of notebook was highly appreciated by the writer and traveler.
"Moleskine has returned to the taste of an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand leader at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose by 26% to settle on 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is a remote secret production from the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to draw up some artificial portrait of the buyer, as the clerk will take on the business as well as the student or professional.
The image of Moleskine's notebook is that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open spirit.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, now has almost a hundred of them and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookshops and through the chain of FNAC stores to small boutiques in the city centre where he was able to establish his identity.
“We have been following the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, through the stormy development of e-mails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Zach<0xC3><0xA1>zka", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno, she also released a new record label reminiscent of a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifys its products: bags, diaries, pencils, notebook cases ... The brand expands to a wide range of carriers.
A success that aroused envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment funds of SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployable handicapped workers?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today is the 15th week for hiring handicapped people.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed people with disabilities is still two times higher than the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is it cluttering?
"No, underscores <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Week for the Employment of Persons with Disabilities."
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"At the time, the percentage of the unemployed was not twice as high, but three times as high."
"But there's still a lot to do."
It must be said that for the unemployed people with disabilities, there are numerous obstacles to their entry into work.
These are older people: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% have no maturities and out of 2.3 million high school students, only 10,000 are handicapped.
And finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% of people with disabilities versus 38% on average.
In short, such are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to employment and which represent the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, general manager of the Tremplin Association, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses accept handicapped workers.
So much for the objective brakes.
It remains unspoken, ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
The study, conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité association, found that the managers questioned had a “low level of knowledge about handicapped people” with an “overwhelming view of people in wheelchairs and mental or mental disabilities”.
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of employing 6% of the disabled workers laid down in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures, which come from 2008, indicate a level of 2.6%.
“We are now moving about 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, which is responsible for collecting fees from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence is the number of "punished" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell from 59,000 guilty enterprises between 2007 and 2011 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ handicapped workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What luck"
Before Tuesday evening (20h45), the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match will bring them.
We will not go that far to write that there was a union between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the stage of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard calmed down.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach gave his player only words of praise.
"I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, and with the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," assures the French Lille player.
When it comes to the difference between his performance in club matches and the national team matches, "it's the same thing, it's justified."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clean up my mark."
Hazard, investigated against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "lighten up".
However, the term “joy” cannot be forgotten.
Play against Bleus, which he encouraged for 7 years and in their winning draws in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
This is more because "they are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"We crossed right away."
"To be able to play against them, that's just pleasure!"
Leekens kindly reminded me of "proudness".
"Hardness" to beat the "wage - holiday".
The “hardness” also states in the quality of the “neighbors” that France has become a very high-level team once again, just over a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a tremendous piece of work," he said.
Although Belgium will be missing at the next European Championship, a technical footballer would like to see in 2014 on a plane with France heading... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great," he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll be aware of it for the next game, including against France.
Portugal is very self-confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento kicks off with great optimism a barrage against Bosnia Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
“At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento can be seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. The Portuguese football team, whose club has been playing since 2010, has qualified for Euro 2012.
In fact, Portugal is 90 minutes away from happiness.
There is only one match left and one opponent - Bosnia.
With the Friday result (0-0) in the Bosnian Zenice hell it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour’s lead, but were not able to give him such a rare goal that would relieve him.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk because we didn't score."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will step in front of an audience that should create a boiling boiler there, even though the match definitely appears to be "very balanced", says the optimist, but cleverly considering Bento.
"We expect a very balanced game, but we are quite confident that we can have a top," said the 24-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,” Carlos Queiroze said.
An indecisive Friday game in Bosnia forces Portugal to score and win.
An indecisive match can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
“It’s a good result, but it’s a risk in itself because we didn’t score out,” Bento says.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and has players with great individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will have an interest in developing for the Bosnian team from the beginning maximum pressure so that "they do not give them time to think."
A good idea, provided that this time it turns out to be realistic.
