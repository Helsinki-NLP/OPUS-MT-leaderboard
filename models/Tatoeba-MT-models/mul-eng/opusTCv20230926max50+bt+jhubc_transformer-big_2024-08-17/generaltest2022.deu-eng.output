The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm a #PRS_ORG# wholesaler and so it's not a problem for me.
All you need is a number or instruction that I attach to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
Today it costs 179<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another possibility of the credit?
I also believe that children should not be allowed to assume a parenting role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big brothers to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Let's take a look, let's help briefly, let's bring the bottle, etc.
This is how they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be children, I don’t see a problem.
If your K1 is busy on its own for a short time and it’s OK for him, that’s fine.
You can decide for yourself whether this is right for your children.
It is not that he should wrap K2 and accompany it for hours at bedtime.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps that is why the statement of psychologists also comes.
Because if something really should happen like a fire, collapse, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your judgment ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole action but the title everywhere does not want to impress me anymore maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, an animal farmer commits suicide by spilling food and walking into his cage to his predatory cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation, goes to his therapists, who runs a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The Commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and lands with this therapist.
There will be more suicides and there will be another protagonist - a photographer who will be assigned anonymously before each suicide will go to the place of suicide and document and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient plant a chip, the one in the brain suppresses an anxiety center and finally the patients face their fear in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window another walks with the intention of dying)
This fear is referred to in the book as “the fight.”
In the end, there was a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That’s the gross act I’m pretty sure the book was written in the original by a French author/author.
If this action is familiar to anyone or anyone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
I don't have the password for Wlan.
I need to contact my husband first.
But it can take a while.
What steps do I need to follow?
Is it also possible to get the price difference back?
Child, 4 y., splitter under thumbnail
Child, four years old, has over the entire length wood splitter under the thumbnail (outside).
They tried to pull him with a tweezer.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
By combining digital decoder and sound module on a circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locus of the track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and come always with an 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker in addition to sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It controls the DCC data format as well as Motorola<0xC2><0xAE>, Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 stages are as obvious as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus<0xC2><0xAE>, the decoders automatically log in to a suitable digital centre.
It controls all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom<0xC2><0xAE>, the CV values on the main track can be read out with suitable hubs.
For centers that can only program the CVs of 1-255 there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> users benefit from up to 28 stages at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola<0xC2><0xAE> addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also enables reprogramming with the honorable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration of mfx<0xC2><0xAE>-compatible power stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder detects the M<0xC3><0xA4>rklin<0xC2><0xAE> brake lines as well as ZIMO<0xC2><0xAE> HLU brake commands or the Lenz<0xC2><0xAE> ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brake blocks or with DC voltage.
In addition, it also stops at a Selectrix<0xC2><0xAE> brake diode.
An ABC automatic commuter train allows the automatic commuter between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC waves.

Omikron: Johnson wants to push for fresh chimpanzee
More and more Omicron cases are gaining in politics and science in the UK.
By the new year, therefore, all eligible adults in England should receive a vaccination offer.
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress in the coronavirus vaccinations in the face of rapidly rising Omicron numbers than he has been aiming for so far.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK government will also provide support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well.
One is facing an emergency in the face of the Omicron variant, which is why vaccine protection urgently needs to be strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Let's boost now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omicron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total number to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was a steady increase of 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am for everyone to imagine themselves with pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but rather a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to keep an official from stepping over my feet.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
Four of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn’t work.
Obviously, the chair had an unobtrusive lack of sales.
How can such a padding damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
First try on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it has been working since about.
14 days no more.
That’s why I always bought the last books through the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like to add 2 chairs to the order and invoice it to me.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I’m going to write a little bit about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something about the soul.
I (21) come into contact more often with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really gets to me and unfortunately is too common that many victims can’t help themselves or think we might not be able to help them.
I know we can’t do everything and it’s not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing, I cannot reach all.
I don’t know what the reason is, maybe it’s fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of getting the kids out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, partly even very close to the tears, all are worth being able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to accept violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it will never be easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incomprehensiblely important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What brings the series to "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, a lot of complicated names, a stunning appearance: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP Giants Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was loyal.
Again nothing: For the second time in not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the match, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with a look back at the Cup defeat at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October: "We still have some anger in our stomach".
However, it did not settle after the game - but rose again in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Even more than the naked result, the way of appearance disappointed.
A representative should be called a statistic that expresses the whole dilemma: The three-quote was just 13 percent, 4 hits (especially from the young Johannes Patrick) when saying and writing 31 attempts - still questions?
John Patrick responded by saying, “We just weren’t focused enough after the victory at Tenerife and didn’t realize what we were training.”
To move the ball.
His response to Sebastian Gleim was quite different: “To win a cool game for the second time against Ludwigsburg,” said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people ago".
Only 750 visitors were allowed at the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they came at their own expense.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team’s game.
"The best player I've ever coached," Gleim said.
While in Patrick's team, the performers Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already fallen behind 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
Fortunately, there’s not much time left for hate.
As early as Wednesday (19:00) the giants received the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims have been rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have therefore written to them again.
We originally signed up half a year ago.
Always peeled out of the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of beats from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on the road with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
In fact, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that's not what it's gonna be.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official instructions" to contain the coronavirus.
Other of his performances planned in the Advent season must also first appear on the website of the singer, who will be 59 today, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists will then want to meet their dates as early as 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian L<0xC3><0xBC>nen, Max Raabe has already sung a lot and likes to sing as a teenager.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow musicians.
Since then, the Bariton has established itself with its repertoire of beats and songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has often been awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his hit album "For Women That's Not a Problem" (2013) - second place on the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair combed back strictly and thought of label, Max Raabe is no longer to be taken away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good Day, Good Luck", he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small piece of furniture in advance?

It still doesn't work I can only crave the cover sheet but don't leaf.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by appropriation
The new Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the eviction of large housing companies, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an extension, no new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Dagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
By the way, a colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against a monopoly education.
In Berlin, the SPD, Greens and Left Party coalition wants to set up an expert committee to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not exclude talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition on further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent-price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rent mirror.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
However, if the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in the payment.
The product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be available again?
Or will it ever come again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
The voucher sounds great
Then I will solve it independently with the new order
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long will it take to ship in itself?
I've already cut myself on the finger
That's an absolute cowardice.
At least 100 dead by tornadoes in Kentucky
In the event of a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been pulled through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be reported.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
During the night of Saturday, several tornadoes have wreaked havoc in the United States and may have claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms left a snowfall of some 320 kilometers in length, especially in the state of Kentucky.
His governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was most severed, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He alone counts in the state of Kentucky with up to a hundred deaths, the official figures rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that she has sold out showcase #NAME#.
That's too bad.
Is it still produced?
Or is it completely out of the range?
Is it possible to order this display in another country?
When do you sign up?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order !
I understand, only can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an item via the contact form or left a return and wanted to ask if it was arrived or edited, as I have not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccine premiums and change advertising claims
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
Thus, they are in line with the social partners <0xC3><0x96>GB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today demanded financial incentives for a vaccine.
The redesign of advertising slogans for examinations – according to the German model – is also intended to increase the readiness for coronavirus vaccinations.
He's changed into a company he's been scaring about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
Obviously, he didn’t get stuck in his old place and was looking for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn’t find his job well either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
This will be legally relevant.
I'm doing a screen shot.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to Grusse!
I am currently directing the adventure Over the Grip Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly guide my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the bad weights and their motivations are written, the individual acts are designed and now I am writing the entry adventure and are already stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a carriage with grains of gratin to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the next action will take place.
A few miles away from the village, the hero is to pick up a group of Goblins and lure them into custody.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger at an early stage, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 armed with bows and arrows
In case of non-observation, the Goblins lurk the hero in a hollow path and flank three arches to the left and right of me armed the vehicle, while two with spears stop the vehicle.
If it comes to fighting and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions
The heroes are all found unconscious and subsequently healed by the son of the village school, a half-breed.
The cart is gone, of course.
Should a defeat inevitably seize his right half with two of his servants and come to the aid of the hero in the fight.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you keep Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much to start an adventure?
The Goblins group will play a crucial role later, so it’s not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely cherish many of your ideas and now I also have more confidence in my narrative.
I built the lamp apart again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still does not work.
That's why I'd still like to send them back
If you can then send the receipts, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

All of a sudden, the crack was there.
I just sat on it
Here was the lower part, so almost the part was damaged with storage space.
Will it all be taken back or just part of the storage space?
I am excited about Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to get a little air with this post.
For the first time today, the transfer was cancelled in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the start of the schedule was far behind schedule, one could still show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!)
However, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be limited, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Despite this, especially Sky UK has transferred the race to the bottom.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then, in F1, there was once again the rule knowledge of the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that under a red flag you were allowed to change the tyres.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, the two only came to the conclusion that Verstappen may change the tires when there were corresponding radio rumors on this subject to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew right away that this possibility exists for stumbling.
I think such basic rules should simply be known when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
In general, don’t like the artificial comment style of Roos, but admit that it is a matter of taste.
But then I seriously even like Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant aberrations that make both just seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (as well as unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the latter brings a lot of restlessness to the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertisement simply takes over hand at Sky, in the finish line Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can listen to at F1TV since only the German track without comment has to come out right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels do less advertising than Sky in training, and this as a free TV channel.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very tasty and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast the F1.
Unironisch makes RTL a better job in the four races they are still allowed to transfer up to the advertisement.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On the here: #PRS_ORG# pendulum lamp, brass and multicoloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and that still isn’t being delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The First Lady told me it was being sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she was going to check and send an email and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already detected a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front of the chair).
I'm asking for help.
Fan pumps are excellent for supplying an aquarium in addition to oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air blowers.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the benefits in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate whole plants with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable so that you can connect multiple outflows.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump, but also offer to put an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (find with us in the shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure trove to call a shell or something like that.
The MK series has a special, sound-absorbed construction and thus ensures low operating noises.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an exhaust manifold by means of an air hose 4/6 mm etc. and can already be started.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and be installed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed between them.
Simply cut through the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent water from running backwards once the water runs out of the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered, like other air pumps, and protected from moisture.
MK Series Pumps are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we enter the processing time with 3 days here in ebay, it is packed daily and the packages are also collected here daily.
Everything goes well along the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to avoid a little bit so that no one is silenced, just because it once took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has an understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping industry...of course there is no corona here.
Please do not rate the same bad, just because the delivery is delayed, this is exclusively due to the parcel services.
Of course you like to gossip about these services, even if we say at the moment...they have damn hard
This is also very different regionally.
Don’t be evil to anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellows with and without armrests?
Can you order your legs in light?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under the bright blue sky, Bezos personally received the freshly cut astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit as he opened the Luke to the capsule.
With the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after which the Blue Origin rocket system was named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had been waiting for their tickets.
How much they paid each for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father’s mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard on his efforts and do everything himself.
She just flew in like that, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also impressed.
He’d rather go back into space, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automatically.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, sometimes with gravity, before the reusable object re-launched from large parachutes.
The International Aeronautics Association and many other experts view 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already Blue Origin’s third manned all-out trip: Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board the first in July, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
Second in October was the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and deputy chief executive officer of Blue Ori.
Critics suggest Bezos and Blue Origin to move the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and I find the subject quite exciting in itself and also in the laboratory do not bother me (I already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, even before studying about career prospects, I already thought at the time that I would like to study until graduation and will.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially concerning my career prospects.
On the one hand (studycheck etc) you always hear great job opportunities and the profession is totally wanted, on the other hand you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
Therefore, I would really be interested in:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work / salary?
3) What did you study/What training did you do?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your feedback!
I am currently really uncertain and will consider discontinuing my studies in 2022 and training as a computer scientist.
If you have any experience, please write it again :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why I'm posting a post about it now.
Not just before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our operation.
As it seems, there are those even before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was Mar<0xC3><0xA4> Himmelfahrt, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So, what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
According to e-mails, which were definitely still out before boarding, order here order there, all *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because "next week then" sounds after so much time and it can't be?
Or because people want to do as much for everyone seriously in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very nervous.
What should this self-sustaining for holidays?
Why do we have holidays when we are not allowed to give them right?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent on it.
My question is simple: Is it just us, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-Evangelical kind?
Do you know that in the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but has no gifts yet.
“The beauty, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, is that you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest,” said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the party by baking and baste with her son.
“I love that,” Catterfeld said.
But until the very last days, she still has a lot to do: “For the first time, I don’t have any gifts yet, I finally have to go now.”
NEKTON-Bio supports the smooth running of the mouse and the formation of the feathers.
NEKTON Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 <0xCE><0xBC>g of biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of the feather damage that occurs in the holding of birds is due solely to nutritional errors.
Since the feather consists of a protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses that occur during the mouse are due to a lack of or unbalanced protein supply and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of the amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the use of NEKTON bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is cold water-soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately it still doesn't work
DDR-Handwork model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the proposal of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with track and faulty parts, the locomotive is a good feature
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we can be operated
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could carry 2,200 tonnes of coal trains and 530 tonnes of passenger trains at 45 km/h travelling speed.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager-drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens Schuckertwerke with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahn improvement plant Dessau, the reworkability of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] With the progressive re-electrification of the central German network, there was an increasing need for locomotives for the heavy haulage service, in 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were reworked, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
In this case, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 present in larger quantities were first preferably constructed.
Only when the E 94 was intended that the number of rework could not be further increased, did the E 95 move into the point of view of the rework.
[4]At first, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They came to the Halle P railway plant in 1960.
They were mostly used in their own circulation plan in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, there was a problem with the complicated control of locomotives.
This is how it often happened that shooters remained glued during switching actions.
Then the beeman, who was constantly travelling on this locomotive, with hammer and wooden wedge, had to re-unite the shooter during the ride.
Damage to the engines often occurred and led to months of failures in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new construction locomotives at the end of the 1960s, and a significant expansion of the electric plant was not planned at the time, the Reich Railway was able to dispense with old locomotives and most split-gates, leaving the E 95 out of service.
In addition, they said that the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only unanimously, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visual conditions of the driver’s stand.
[5] After the suspension of E 95 02 and E 95 03 in mid-1969, they were last followed by E 95 01, which ceased service on 5 October 1970.
Thus, the proposed new designation 255 001 was never used.
Until the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heating system at the main station Halle.
It took some time for those in charge of the Reichsbahn to be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotives were first reworked externally with the aim of presenting them to a vehicle show at RAW Dessau.
[5] She has since belonged to the Transport Museum Dresden as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotives were completed internally.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale), the locomotive museum is maintained.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational reworking of locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotives were presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paint, with the transformers being checked and five driving engines being operable.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian mountain railway and the branching secondary tracks, where they proved to be reliable due to their drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the central German network.
The main area of application was initially Silesia
Handwork model H0 in OVP, function well, it is necessary to rework optical on the loch in self-work, dusted, with play tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handwork model, very small bearing - perhaps the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can have labels and bearing traces.
Yes, the F parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet..leather these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately erroneously produced.
The center bar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get new ones sent.
When will they be released?
No, not flat.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones from the shape, they were just too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
With me they are not flat
Could I get this sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage has occurred in the six-figure euro area, police said on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech county).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not proceed with a deliberate fire.
The Kripo F<0xC3><0xBC>rstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it comes much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To defuse fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech chief U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin had not publicly stated his vaccine status so far.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
A friend’s illness moved him to do so, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer company Biontech, U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There were misinformation on social media that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," Shahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
"For the past few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he has refused to do so because communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a breathing device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, <0xC5><0x9E>ahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often shaken by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear can only be hard to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with the Deutsche Welle circulates on the Internet, in which U<0xC4><0x9F>ur <0xC5><0x9E>ahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," <0xC5><0x9E>ahin said at the time.
There is a priority in Germany for vaccination of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been discontinued for a long time - and the Biontech chief has been vaccinated three times according to appropriate data.
Fire in the surrounding area: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had put out a refueling station.
After a fire with severe damage in a bypass station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Vieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have to escape without electricity for about 24 hours.
The fire caused the lights to go out in several communities on Friday evening at 41,000 affected residents and residents.
The provider Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power units had been in operation until the large-scale malfunction could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care facilities in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The caretaker thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their use.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigade and the THW for their tireless use," said Florian Witt, Head of Primary Technology at the University of Berlin.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnet-Monteurs were initially only able to put some lines back into operation temporarily, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company data.
Electricity is flowing again
The fire, which broke out on Friday at about 7.15 p.m., severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear, according to Westnetz.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is required there.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been gradually connected from 21.30.
Since 11.15 p.m., the last power still affected by the failure would have been electricity.
Over 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies have been in use.
After the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance.
“It is important now that citizens in their neighborhood take care of elderly or single people and report to the local fire brigades if help is needed,” said Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power units, the residents of Altenheimen were mainly focused.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care facilities have been set up in schools for those people who could not provide themselves or need the power-dependent medical devices or rely on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in Euro?
This is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy <0xE2><0x99><0xA1>
But I can't mount the base on the table top.
This is custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't move it in and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send it back because it is otherwise not suitable for the purpose.
I'd love to hear from you.
Yes, it's really easier!
Then let's do it like this!
Will you send me the return card by email?
The repair is now complete.
I tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost shameless.
We do not agree with this

Yes we have both new s and use the version 4.5...
You may have heard of a problem more often.
I have directly with my #PRS_ORG#, bought a book it also seems to be on it.
As soon as I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.

I have to work through it too!
To make the paint job even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water of dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse and dry with clear water.
Before you put the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the no longer visible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Pull the brush evenly next to the line.
Light overlapping of the color layers will ensure a smooth surface area later on.
Avoid wiping quickly with the brush.
This creates unrealistically effective surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could come through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to an end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can come to ugly metal smudges if they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you plant them.
The models achieve an original look through the decals or drawing images.
From high-altitude markings on airplanes to ship names to badges and badges on car models: The Decals give the model the final cut.
Apply the decals in the right order as long as the components are still well reachable.
An aircraft cockpit can be easily maintained before it is installed in the hull.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks are when it comes to maintaining time, patience, and a calm hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and set them up for you.
Decals are also called water slide images because you briefly moisten their back with water until the carrier paper gets dark through the wet.
Then push the picture only a small piece of paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also moistened previously).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper away from the side.
Caution: Always check to see if the image is properly seated before you completely push it off the paper so that it does not stick to the finger, pinch or even tear.
Squeeze off excess water with a household cloth.

Then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Will I get it back without any problems?
Child Wish Treatment at PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we were in child wish treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, it suddenly gets across.
The series after:
We had applied for the children’s wish change in advance at the PKV and got the pledge over 3 attempts.
The experiments were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to the successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and carried out 2 (successful) attempts, but these did not count on the PKV yet.
We again applied for the cost takeover at the PKV and again got 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we have made more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones count towards the PKV) we reached the invoices at the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV wants to refund only 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first pledge expire.
The second wish for children is a new insurance case.
However, according to the AGB, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are refunded) or we (there are 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have told us in the pledges that with one birth the further attempts are due?
* Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (due to closed echelons) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to get them back
All right.
We will not order anything from them anymore.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
They are happy to forward this to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the repayment was made and now tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't do anything for the dresser to come to me completely disturbed
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written
It is clear that the refund has been made and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can direct your manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect did not occur until a few months later.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they may not sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will be able to tear down the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question to your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional to purchase stools, but we can't find them with you.
Can they help?
Theme of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget film is exactly, for this there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget movie or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the web you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about it?
And what do you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much
With kind regards,
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll be back soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello!
"Half victory" against Belarus linked to high costs for the EU
The EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (EPD).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation in a sustainable way, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of flux - Belarus does not contribute very little, but the EU feels like a winner - is probably going on for a while.
Human rights at the border are not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently, there is an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not resolutely opposed to this, it is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
“It obviously cannot get through if a Member State is thinking about doing its thing,” as Poland does now, which does not even allow the EU Border Protection Agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU will pay another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, says Bossong: A unity of principles on asylum policy will be made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
A New Attempt at Crossing the Border
According to Poland’s border guard, migrants have once again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
55 Migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a spokesman for the authorities said on Sunday.
Polish officials had been hurled with stones at the incident near Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be provided medically by a military doctor.
In total, the Border Protection 52 registered attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
As early as Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or are trying to do so.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of having lured them into the EU with the prospect of entering the EU as the ruler in Minsk.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania blocked border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to countries of origin of the people to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"There the EU has thrown its market power into the scales and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard ties and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly lock thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes Protests After Controversial Formula 1 Final
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have made two regular breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has challenged.
The silver arrows suggest two regular breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the final safety car phase, when he is said to have crossed regularly.
A second objection was raised against the rating at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had surpassed Lewis Hamilton in the last round of the Mercedes and had become his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutch had overrun cars driving in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report back to you.
Thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park organizes SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa-Park, named after the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited Fantag to the SC Freiburg.
As the park reports, members and permanent card holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
On that day, the train backlighted through the jerseys red and white.
F<0xC3><0xBC>chsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect setting,” says the park.
Since the beginning of the 90s, the cooperation between the Bundesliga player and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has been established.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it was again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans who have fun in the back track together confirm this,” says Europa-Park owner J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Mack.

Steps in the career of the new World Champion
The Dutchman Max Verstappen is the new world champion of Formula 1.
Max Verstappen did it.
In his seventh year in Formula One, the Dutchman won his first World Cup title in the Red Bull.
His way to the top of the king class:
Abu Dhabi - 2012, Italy: Verstappen plays the World Kart Championship after a crash in Sarno.
Father Jos Verstappen leaves him on his return trip angry at a gas station.
His mother Sophie Kumpen collects the teenager in the back of the car.
2014, England: Red Bull’s junior team is getting promising young people in Verstappen.
The 16-year-old thus steps into the footsteps of Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo.
For the first time, he will be driving in the European Formula 3.
2015, Australia: Verstappen starts at the age of 17 and 166 days as the youngest pilot in history in a Grand Prix.
Due to a defect, he must suspend his Toro Rosso in Melbourne early.
2015, Malaysia: The then Toro-Rosso-Pilot Verstappen is also the youngest racer to score 1 points in Formula One at the age of 17 and 180 days.
In Sepang at the Malaysian Grand Prix, Verstappen finished seventh.
2016, Spain: Verstappen equals victory in his first race for Red Bull.
With 18 years and 228 days, he will sensationally become the youngest Grand Prix winner in Formula 1 history in Barcelona.

I already had a huge problem with you back then when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# chest of drawers.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Home"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensibly to the nocturnal sound at her doorstep.
I gave up the contact form yesterday to return an article, but received no email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request came in.
Not everyone has the time for your cluttered chat and misdelivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you fix and not all of our household.
Contact Woman #NAME#.
I can't chat with you every day
We had been chatting yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# night table and a return label.
This e-mail has not arrived yet.
The package wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like a pimp says he has nothing against foreigners.
Your i won't admit it.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it complete.
Yeah wow then you're not as serious as colleagues.
Those who seriously question evolution in principle are simply completely lost.
Because of me, a God has set it all in motion.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science just sucks nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and no longer take seriously as a colleague.
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The lens system, specially designed aplanatically and achromatically, allows you to use the lupe to the edge zone without any distortion or colour errors.
Lups are often marked with magnification data.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to make the best use of your magnifying glass, please refer to the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - i.e. even in the event of a collision - light reflections are created.
By means of an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When the optimal conditions of use are met - lupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the attached instructions for use (available in German and English).

Tannensale in Sch<0xC3><0xB6>nwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women seek out the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced such a curious situation in the sale of tannen.
Once, a man is supposed to have gone home without his partner, because the two couldn’t agree.
Each year, he plants about 2,000 plants.
The 56-year-old has already experienced such a strange situation.
This always makes Christmas a little fun, he says.
What about the voucher??
Am I gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions about the better court, but there is some similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spoon.
Both of them have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "dreher", which by far doesn't sound so delicious.
Problems with fiberglass + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I now have trouble building a stable wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out 50 Mbit up to a few outages.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, will also arrive.
However, on the other DLan module, which sends the wifi, do not arrive the full 500, but the further I get away in the house with the module, the less comes (so use a socket that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. spaces away from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (<0x5C><0x7E>45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which seems to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too there were similar big losses.
Could someone explain to me why with fiberglass, so much internet speed is "lost" via the power line?
Is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely difficult to install LAN cables in the house.
I’m really desperate, which is why I created an extra account here.
That is why I would be more than happy to receive an answer.
When it's time to change the Giro account
Who would have thought, for the first time now would be at rest with the Girokonts, seems to have been deceived.
While many banks have used the fall to get any tricks from their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past, the free amounts for negative interest continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros long.
Now she has just halved the free amount and even quartered for the daily money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group-Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 euros for giro and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily money accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesperson on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as is the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is just popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free money in two stages, initially to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000, and now to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,000.
After all, more than 100 banks, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, now have a free amount of 25,000 euros or less.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which in the first instance have even been granted a right in front of the regional court in Berlin against this regulation.
Now banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly form reserves - in the event that even the higher courts declare the negative interest in principle to be inadmissible and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.

Jennifer Aniston Is Employing an Entire Beauty Army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston, 52, was voted the most influential woman of the year by the American magazine The Hollywood Reporter.
For them, who made the 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" furore, this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, treat yourself to one chip a day (yes, correctly read: ONE chip out of the bag).
The fact that you still fly the hearts of female and male fans in the same way is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has bad luck - and is still looking for great love.
And the baby's wish has been removed from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what’s going on with me personally, medically, why I can’t.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end of a career: R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen must give up
Kimi R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen’s farewell to Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled out his gloves and wiped the sweat off his forehead.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight tyre touch, R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after not even half of the race distance at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the Motorsport king class.
His wife Minttu and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
R<0xC3><0xA4>ikk<0xC3><0xB6>nen’s biggest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He scored 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and reached the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in Zweierbob - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
“I figured this out, I would have to win nine-and-a-half victories per season, then I could make it until Cortina 2026,” said the BSC Oberb<0xC3><0xA4>renburg double Olympic champion, who booked two victories in two days during the Winterberg races.
He first defended the attack on Saturday by five hundred pieces, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he slightly changed the material setting and took a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberb<0xC3><0xA4>renburg) and Alexander Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ller (SV Halle), he sat down in front of the British Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
“We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded,” said Friedrich, who also introduced his 22nd victory in the series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, driving for Stuttgart, came in second place this time in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in fourth place in the first race.
“If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way,” Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte took the third win of the season in the doubles.
After reaching fourth place in the Monobob the previous day, she climbed to the World Cup on Sunday in the German Triples with her runner-up Deborah Levi.
Two-Bob Olympian Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second place with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she booked the first podium this winter.
Wiesbaden Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium place in the World Cup, I’m super happy that Mariama takes me.
I am super happy with the development.
There’s still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times were okay today,” Burghardt said, stressing: “It’s not just pushing, but there’s a lot to do around here as well.”
Jamanka was a little upset about the not entirely error-free rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just didn’t get it and therefore can’t redeem it, which is why I have finally asked for it.
I had a lot of problems with Corona last year and never had time to do so.
And now he said it was over, which made me very angry.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare seat bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again as it has just been reduced :)
Why is the shipment only launched on 16.3?
There was no such long delivery time on your website
Not until I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
It was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why this is a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the misdelivered goods.
But we want the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged
Do not cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello love great girls and girls and women,
I have a lot of things I just want to write and maybe it's the one - or the other as well...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - sometimes apart from not crying my dog or going to kindergarten he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has gotten a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we kissed a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him with the shower (because the hand is in the association wg combustion).
It is also cooled and we are currently seeing less (1-2x week) which makes me very much able to cope with my needs for affection and love.
My dog just has a stomachache, I’ve cooked for him and now he’s lying in his cuddle blanket and has relaxed a bit after I’ve been there with the heat lamp and stroking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we have to stop housework on us, which we naturally divide.
But cooking itself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTSD is well-established, I’m half well-treated and I’m getting better.
Not good, but I get right and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university just requires a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 p.m. I have a written test for which I haven’t done anything yet and the morning after anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Just until his birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out that I need these mental cues because otherwise I'll pack the ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can’t even put that into words.
I don't know if I'd have survived my kptbs.
I think this also partly has something to do with women’s mental load, and that’s why I thought I’d definitely find fellow sufferers here...
I definitely wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I got my order today unfortunately is the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has print.
For the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, do I get another color or what?
The e-mail for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
The rest twice.
But she was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I found in school at the time that many religious teachers don’t believe in God and it’s just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, this has always been a strange thing, perhaps because I was raised as a Christian, and I have always believed in some way.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can also tell about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
Give him a lesson plan, etc.
But it’s just strange to have a physics teacher who doesn’t believe in relativity.
What does it mean to want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
Culture or something like that?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?I like to write in English I understand that too
It's been a long time, so I'd miss it.
It's okay, thanks.
I expect a reply by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (by 24).
I think it was a movie for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
First of all, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite certain).
Since I can’t describe it any further in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and an action is formed.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to be able to live on his own.
I think the transition is also the soldier's grave.
In the end, both soldiers are fighting each other.
If I tell you something, I am grateful for every response.
Our little girl has only slept on her stomach since week 1.
Fast forward : still alive :D
Relax. Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than you think.
Make sure everything is right around the corner, no pets, often go in and watch, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when he sleeps.
Is it turning your head aside?
Is it possible to get something out of your stomach?
Or is it in front of the face directly in the mattress?
You can tell if everything is okay.
We’ve all grown up and when my husband came into the world, it was a walk and there would be that you put the kids on your stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "customer" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why do you offer me only 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written with a colleague from you yesterday and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not currently to be used.
To be perfectly clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know, not everything can be kept.
I had a lot of fun with RBTV as well.
It is simply that the policy of this channel is now under all strain.
Almost every format is sponsored (okay), but then at the same time go on a big bed tour.
It has been said that you are an "independent" Internet transmitter.
Quote Arno: You don't want to be "a running lithic column".
What are you doing now?
An 0815 ad that tries to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then there's Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, these apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to offend people.
A coward who is completely lacking in empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploding rented rooms tries to make ash.
How to find all of this well?
Great if you like it, I find it scary.
I'm asking for callback, as my supplied wooden table was delivered defective.
Body failure due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for abs or just for cuddling – My little warm-up friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Kirschkern cushions are a traditional home remedy for well-being heat applications, as Kirschkerne can absorb heat very well and deliver it in doses.
The removable inner cushion can easily be heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they don’t feel so good.
The Kirschkern cushion with reference is suitable for the following applications only:
Before heating the pillow to unusual smells, floor or fire spots, check and dispose of immediately in the presence.
Please remove the inner cushion for heating in advance from the cover!
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (please note the microwave manufacturer's details!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the cushion by shaking!
Then put the inner pillow back into the cover.
During the first heating, a slight formation of moisture may occur on the surface, but it disappears in repeated applications.
Be sure to stick to the indicated heating instructions, as longer periods or higher energy performance can lead to damage (inflammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion has been put back into the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 <0xC2><0xB0>C) at your armrest!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish conditions, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, blood clots and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough for the operation.
Incorrect display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the plugged-in power supply.
After that, I expanded the battery, but nothing is happening here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
20 liters of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stowed with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need on everyday objects, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design has it literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing second-hand access to photo equipment.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
In this case, in the closure flap there is a closure hook made of metal with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered various "filling levels": namely, there are 4 anchor bars, stably destroyed, in which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Folding closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be reliably closed without locking the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: in addition to the cover flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to fret about the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday suitability of the backpack: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more on the bottom) and so easily store both of them separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday stuff stays safe in the left half of the backpack and does not come in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content will remain dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting for the email from your support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the order of the

So far I have not received a message.
I ask for immediate processing.
I am already writing with the third support staff, with no one I came beyond the promise that I will receive an email as a confirmation.
It's about sending back the wrong delivered custom #NAME#
Do you know when the cabinet will be ready to be delivered again?
To keep him like that is not an option for me...
It's working.
Thank you very much for the help

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was supplied with a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, then I will immediately place a larger order, but after all I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that last year went differently than thought I couldn’t guess and I just couldn’t redeem it in time and clear it up.
But I have the damage as a customer and I do not accept that.
Roting brake discs are designed for the requirements of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of the brakes is appreciated even under difficult conditions.
Rotating brake discs are made of cast and then mechanically processed (dried and cut).
All tinted discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain discs and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is aimed at balancing the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tinted discs made in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the efficiency of the cooling of the disc, with the incisions improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tinted discs underline the character of each car with an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered bright blocks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and unleashed the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were cut off, tents laid down, and saloons and hotels were formed almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country’s wealth.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game you are a pioneer looking for wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, rally horses and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to surpass your pioneer colleagues in order not to quarrel with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions at the same time, you have to keep your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained official citizenship).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and at the same time select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables the half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players alternately carry out actions, such as winning resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunmen.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the prizer turns to a new location and changes the available actions.
This goes on until the appraiser has moved five times, so each location has covered once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players have to defend Coloma from an assault of angry bandits.
If the players have sufficiently assisted revolvers and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is done.
The player with the most winning points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation appeared today in my Twitter timeline, and I looked at it right away.
>The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and talks all over Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce educational debate.
Ex-patients and educators are now facing serious charges against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible must never, ever, ever, go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for his development and to make the framework for the child as big as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the elimination of the testing obligation for triple-vaccinated
At its next meeting, the health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide waiver of the testing obligation for triple vaccines.
“Our countries need quick clarity as to whether and when the testing obligation can be waived for three times vaccinated,” said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Minister’s Conference, the “Picture on Sunday”.
The elimination of 2G plus for triple-vaccines is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional vaccine incentive," Holetschek said.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will make a proposal to the Minister of Health Conference on Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back
What do I do best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seating area is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make a purchase through my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page goes to the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What can this be about?
What you describe is called *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under full anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
It is most common to hear sounds/voices, less often to see pictures and most rarely to feel pain.
For this topic relevant: Imperial cuts are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child up to the obliteration.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the prednisone conversation.
Certain anaesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment by me describes awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **by definition none.
I read your comment wrong.
The chair is defective.
The $20 doesn’t help either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again to see if you are at least taking back the defective chair.
We sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I've already sent you an email that you haven't answered.
Again the question.
In the order and on the invoice it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver in front of the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I do not know a person who can carry the heavy furniture in the first floor.
Am I not going to be called?
I had asked a question
Theater historian G<0xC3><0xBC>nther R<0xC3><0xBC>hle dies aged 97
He has profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre history.
On Friday, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther R<0xC3><0xBC>hle died at the age of 97.
There is the new book on the table, printed fresh: "An old man gets older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell from the world led by theatre historian and journalist G<0xC3><0xBC>nther R<0xC3><0xBC>hle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the message that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I've already witnessed my life thanks here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European pallets, standardised wooden pallets, which are mainly used in the European space as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to statistics Austria in Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in 2020.
The production value was 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually will not be collected

Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got a lot of great tips for the perfect gulash here a week ago.
It was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and butchery!
So thank you again for that :)
Now I have come to the taste and want to cook roulades for the first time on New Year’s Eve.
Tomorrow I'm going to set up a cattle fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is no longer so good, but I get it.
It's about a refund of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>#NUMBER#
I was informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
To this day, the money has not come to me.
Would you please check it out?
Where there are still Christmas breads in the room L<0xC3><0xBC>beck
For many people, Gans or ducks are among the Christmas days like the pine tree and the gifts.
You haven't taken care of any birds yet?
Now the time is running out.
We will tell you where in the L<0xC3><0xBC>beck area you will get a Christmas toast.
The "drive" of a tube end stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can adjust the desired level and, on the other hand, the distortion of your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything about the "gain" and distortion.
On top of that, it already sounded like you could even float a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL controller when it comes out loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a box simulation, so that even when using a headphone or when recording directly, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
The AUX box can be connected to a CD or MP3 player, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice device.
If you also spend a VFS5 foot button, you can also conveniently call the sounds by foot, turn the effects blocks on/off and "tap" the speed of the compatible effects.
In fact, this is essential for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen it that way with others.
Is it possible for you to send the lamp back?
Because it's too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it is not possible, I would also be happy with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don’t need are a lot.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) to the provided hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait time is not worth it
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
In the negotiations on the reviving of the international nuclear agreement, progress has been made, according to Iranian officials.
“Both sides are just about to agree on the issues that should be on the agenda,” Iran’s chief negotiator Ali Bagheri said on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development" because at the beginning there was not even a consensus on the issues to be negotiated.
The deal is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement had continued after almost a week of interruption.
Traders from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A U.S. delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly participates in the negotiations.
Thuringia Overtakes Saxony - Free State Now Federal State With Highest Corona Incident
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
As the only federal state, Thuringia was above the 1000 mark at the Corona Incident on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had the highest incidence in the whole of Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had declined slightly, but had also exceeded the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths were reported in connection with an infection within one day.
More than 200 patients with severe COVID-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and are hardly even behind with the detection of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery is only carried out at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and paste it on the package and post it to the post office, that was it, right?
Do I need to click/enter/fill anything else?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to take the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is in my opinion a freshness.
It's time for change
Welcome to my day, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What's the post here?
If you look at the activity in the last months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: it is not existent.
We have come into a winter starrer and have extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
For the most part, this should simply be related to the dissatisfaction, how some things have gone and how we are in general.
Over the last few days, it has become increasingly apparent that many of us still have a bock on Mbundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community is asked about the MBundestag, which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last few days and has found a, to put it simply, pile of scarves.
After a while of writing back and forth, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call on everyone to participate, only in this way this project can exist in the future.
For this purpose, we have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which we can exchange with each other, as well as work out concrete things.
You can access the server via this link.
Objectives:
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> How will the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed/adapted/removed?
* How are we going to perform outside in the future?
* How to recruit new members?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I’m pretty sure I’ve forgotten a lot, but that’s not bad, we’ve got the discord in the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/global for it and not suitable for my taste.
For this I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, there are also in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG#, however, must be able to guarantee that the defective cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I'm asking you to make that right now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as far as possible for the collection - they need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how that can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a collection date.
Is there a manual for installation?
How long would I have to get it or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, nowadays she probably eats meat very rarely.
I used to be a vegetarian for a few years.
To the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism has been a planned interim step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that I thought for a long time that I, as a vegetarian, would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I would ultimately support animal cruelty.
So I decided to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that mismut came on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and thought she knew where her meat came from and you as a vegetarian reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to “plump” was?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that you as a vegan are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without which you would put it on.
It welcomes a harmonizing vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception under <0xC2><0xA7> 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# does not collect my return on site.
Since I can’t be there because of a funeral, unfortunately this can’t be changed either.
Can you please give me an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I will be constantly meeting again.
Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz handed over a grant note in the Lahnstein City Hall of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the Volunteer Fire Department Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this,” says Mayor Peter Labonte of Lahnstein.
The vehicle is used by the diving staff Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice conservation as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, the boom of hotel boating on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the further increasing use of the lahn as a leisure flow, are expected to contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read by 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, following their recommendations, I synced, removed, and the app reloaded NOTS worked.
I’m a little frustrated because the whole action has already taken a lot of time and I’m now hoping for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# in June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

Thank you for putting the whole thing here for the first time, I also spent almost a decade in the public service in a similar activity, so we were also weapons carriers in the executive, I still don't want to go into it!
The question of the right and the left is always very simplified.
In principle, however, it should be said that of course the civil servant comes from the liberal to the conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
The fact that, of course, even in the special uniform and weapons carrier, do not attract people to the right of conservative magic should be clear to everyone that these people can then of course deal with the lived reality is also clear, because you have of course not only the average white, but also many Germans with the background of migration, and do not have these women in common, and I do not have the normal
But these marginal groups also represent even if for the first time it sounds funny from my experience after a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by excessive left-wing politics, even if this policy is supposed to work for them or they think it will have to do them right, they just want to do it normally.
Back to the rights, of course, since the police and the armed forces are also a cross section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any state-threatening plans is completely exaggerated and annoys me as well.
Of course, it happens that it is also the case that police officers and soldiers who were often in foreign service often began to paschalize due to negative experiences and even sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that sometimes you will meet right-minded people who conduct a rainy exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, in my opinion this is well fought and also counteracted with political education and education!
Germany is so internationally intertwined and that is also so good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I don’t understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side too.
Why should it come from England?
When I ordered it, it was not sold out.
I ordered it in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've used #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in Black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always think of you as a partner.
but at the top of the wooden part are two deep jugs filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratcher
Ordinarily by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy with one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (by myself, very little free time), but for the rest of my life I get it more bad than just keeping my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything stays, and then and when it packs me and I get up and clean.
But it’s never really that “someone could visit spontaneously.”
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, although it bothers me somewhere but usually loses budget simply against work and unhappiness.
The kitchen is even more regularly cleaned as we like to cook.
Now to my question, did you manage to become more orderly with the child?
We haven’t worked on it yet, and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
For me I don’t have an incentive, it just doesn’t bother me so much, as long as no visit comes and, for example, there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger incentive with your child or do you stay slim?
I look forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I have been training in software development and have been studying for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I find more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiety-avoiding) personality disorder (<0xC3><0x84>VPS).
That roughly means that I don’t have a sense of self-worth and are accordingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a physical level, but it is very difficult for me to have loose conversations and I have been told more often that I seem unattainable (which I think has gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family support.
But I don’t know if the concrete workday is really the way I imagine it, and it’s hard to find something on the internet.
The <0xC3><0x84>VPS already leads me to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("it's already simple things fucked") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should be able to work with my wife"
I will probably have the problems in every profession but I wanted to mention it instead.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I'm waiting for a pickup date
What do you mean by return?
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message does not come your #PRS_ORG# authorizes this book
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed divides the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds up from them its own body proteins, which it also needs for the formation of feathers.
The formation of feathers in nestling and the formation of feathers in the mousting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high stress for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be given during breeding, as otherwise there may be disturbances in the gross flow.
Following this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily supply of vitamins with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON bio on 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
1 g of NEKTON-Bio is equal to 1 g of a striped measuring spoon (inlaid).
In case of severe fidget damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of the fidget regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is reached until the spring re-formation is complete.
Storage: NEKTON bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15<0xC2><0xB0> and 25<0xC2><0xB0>C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this e-mail?
Statement by a community employee in contravention of the statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property a walnut tree is to be liked.
So a case application was made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the case of fruit trees and thus walnuts is not part of the statute.
In the statute, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your reply
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I did not receive a message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that's the only question is if I can pay in Euro and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that out?
Emergency report: Serious traffic accident in Selb

There are injured.
It's okay to understand.
Well, then thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
Merry Christmas to you for the first time!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is just ruining everything you can think of.
Before I get here .. in short: I need advice and the best of people who somehow know my situation – so from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a crosswalker.
Originally I studied something else and also worked there in an area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don’t mention anything more here).
But then all this was too boring for me and I looked at alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I went to the teacher’s office and I was sure that it was – even though the framework conditions are significantly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn’t care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the paintings before, I have always decided to go on and at least finish the ref, after which I can still swivel around.
But I'm absolutely done.
I had so little free time in the last month that I was completely exhausted.
Now it’s a holiday, but there’s still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I would be stress-resistant, but there was my weekend and my festive evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn’t matter at the moment.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me.
Basically, it is fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I’m completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it shuts down completely – if it doesn’t already.
I wonder if I would like to have that for the rest of my working life - just when I read some posts from you here - or if I should not go back to the old area, because where I was valued, I could take my free time if I needed it now, and the work did not seem to have been working in a boring way, but I would like to think that
But then I wonder if in a year I have not returned to the same place as now and am dissatisfied.
You see, it’s all kind of weird, but maybe as outsider advice or ideas, as I come out of this situation, which I’m completely finished with, and almost at the slightest thought of starting to cry about it, come out.
I’m not going to make decisions now so emotionally right now, that probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel – or to enjoy Christmas, that’s enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologize for the undertone of my wine.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX’s Valvetronix series has been constantly evolving, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the “Valve Reactor” circuit, which perfectly mimics the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up to date with sound technology.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and Amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity, which is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only swirl.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound and modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, since then, it has been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 again led to a power boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for a maximum sound variety can be found here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a greasy sound, a nuanced reproduction of game dynamics and side effects, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the final stage determined the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier equipped with a 12AX7 tube perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic Loses at Clippers
The defeat series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven counters from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually spaced and foldable Velcro dividers, it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
One possible outfit would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flashlight.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And anyone who has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for photo-foreign things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack provides enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: perhaps the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have done great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
The eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa with 84 days.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still-unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has declined somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still did not dare to predict when it might end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said Mariano Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Zapata, president of the island council, to state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage being estimated at more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, two new landings with a total size of about 50 hectares were created by cold lava.
In particular, banana cultivation, which is of immense importance to the island, was seriously affected, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas severely affected, the newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is at the door and especially the children will not be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the sparkling tension something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that our increasingly divided society still holds together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss has been a peace-building "society of natural peoples", can be softened with this rigid routine and can be revived in this context.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the gift.
Previously, gifts were presented in one way or another on the Nikolaustag.
The background of this still popular site is that St. Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, has secretly thrown three women into her window in one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gift, the custom popular in Germany was to fill the boots especially of the children with gifts.
Protestants opposed this custom because they rejected mediators between God and man as "holy worship."
For these reasons, they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made Nikolaus the Christ Child and thus founded a new tradition.
The focus of the gift thus shifted to the holy evening.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it still annoys the few that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to the use of martins with martinssingen and martinsigzug, is still a solid part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today, you will find everything that the heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, in all Christian-styled countries, a cheerful cuddly model rules over the question of who will now bring the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on the Holy Evening or the Santa Claus, which is in principle a kind of Nicholas, to which some species have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white rauschebart, which has little in common with the more severe Assyrian bartender of the historical figure, his sled drawn by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give gifts, while in Italy, it is the witch Befana who is supposed to have shown them the way to the child Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fabled creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia, fathers brought Frost to some glory.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleds as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite wars, the Christ Child is responsible for giving gifts.

Police shoot alleged bank robbers near the Royal Palace <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Near Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by police on Saturday.
Police said callers had reported a man who allegedly went to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
The man fled, according to authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials shortly after.
There had been gunshots and the man had been hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not think of a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

In the Hollywood spectacle, it’s mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow in inner color.
Smart Stone, on the other hand, is harmless: the sun alone ensures that this sunlight shines fascinatingly – optionally in white or colored light (in the same six different shades of color).
The edgeless, amorphous design is consciously chosen: this modern object of light is presented by day like a naturally shaped large pebble.
Its organic rounds fit in any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He is also doing well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and findlings, where he knows how to claim himself thanks to his size.
Large preliminary work can be saved: »Smart Stone« does not require any power supply or batteries as a solar light.
Set the “Lightstone” to any place that is sunny during the day.
Two of the earth’s spears are provided to ensure a firm hold when needed.
The matt white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides »Smart Stone« inside, along with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery already charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
In the event of darkening, »Smart Stone« automatically begins to shine; in which color, this determines itself: Six attractive light colors are your choice – in addition to daylight white.
Switching off will also be automatic as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a specified minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun rises again, the charging cycle begins the next day from the front.

Pill problem
Hello, my dear women,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill about five years ago again, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I’d like to leave that behind because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic diseases that I can’t choose.
My main problem, surprisingly, is not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten explosive pickles at my last break of about two years from 0 to 100 and those everywhere.
So superficial, but I was very stressed and I didn’t feel comfortable.
During the two-year break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid that this time around.
Perfume-free and without ged<0xC3><0xB3>n is my cosmetics already, but maybe there is something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the female doctor did not take me so seriously and the dermatologist's appointment is yet to come.
Thank you to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, my dear skin is such a bad thing.
Prebupert<0xC3><0xA4>r had bad neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large area of the nostrils and the acne topic.
I also tried everything possible in the course of chr. disease and stayed on sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed food, because nothing else worked so well.
It may also be good that hormone is simply the worm inside, but if you like me everywhere you want to stop also rather not go looking for what else is going wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina o.e.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered on my behalf.
I have to work all the time and on the phone and all of a sudden everything was gone...
What's there to check if the money was there, I'd have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong

In the Name of the People: Laity Judges
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the judge’s bench.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they do not wear a robe: chefs determine with professional judges whether and how long someone goes behind bars.

110kV Earth Cable to be Rebuilt in 2022
The authorisation for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is valid.
The Government of Lower Bavaria’s decision to establish a plan sets the stage for construction to begin in 2022.
This was now shared by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long earth cable will connect the Tann power station in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected to a free wire mast near the village of Edermanning near Reut.

Ref: Plan your lesson (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I’ve been in the Ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I’m currently still having big problems planning my teaching in the field of geography.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so I can basically only use the board, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
In school I can also only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
I just need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors, and I actually stand by every hour.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I do need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
And so are the worksheets.
Maybe I can get a geography teacher to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to finish the return as soon as possible.
The trade scares because of the 2G regulation about the Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or cured are allowed.
Trade considers this to be unnecessary and complains of revenue inflows.
He is also ready for a possible solution.
The 2G regulations destroy the important Christmas business from the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE).
When dealing with items of non-daily need, revenue breaks should be complained, HDE Chief Executive Officer Stefan Genth criticized.
According to a recent survey by HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the rest of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas deal.
“What should actually be the positive climax of the year is now often a hole without soil,” Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis revenues in the past week.
It only works well in the food retail as well as in the online sector.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief executive.
“2G in shopping does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic,” he stressed.
The current regulations frightened customers and required a high level of staffing.
The gang rule had to be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer only had to be checked on 2G (vaccinated or cured) once and had access to all stores with the received bundle on that day.
Moreover, in retail trade – as already in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, cured or tested) – sample checks should be sufficient.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping malls, also spoke about a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were lastly without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level, sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of such an important Christmas business,” said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high level of staff and administrative effort, the Center will try to find and get approved solutions.
This includes the so-called ribbon solution, in which "visitors can, for example, at a central point in the center once provide their 2G proof and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to that of a club hotel - enter all shops undisturbed". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that has been attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That doesn't look good.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and glued it.
How do I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color rendering.
For adjusting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures.
In addition to adjusting brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very light current with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on both the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the lamp in television studios or when the lamp is mounted in hard-to-reach locations.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply by pressing one of the memory keys for a longer period of time, one of the memory keys is occupied and finished.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when turning off, so that when new turns on the known situation is again - very convenient in the studio work if, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can resort to existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check in front of the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester just with built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply electricity to the headlamp via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlamp is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for fixing, so you can directly to your photo stand.
The inclination is to be set reliably on both sides by means of fasteners.
It was noted that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a bend joint is included in the delivery.
Large, this is also included in the delivery of a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may still want to buy, without any problems.
It’s a shame I gave it away and it’s too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after torrid comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in a series of undefeated Hessen were probably on their way to the next Bundesliga game.
But then the SGE turned up, within a good hour, froze over an overgrown start to the season from the soul and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys did today", coach Oliver Glasner cheered at DAZN and spoke to a "pauschal-lob", each of them.
At first, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurter, who is still ahead of their expectations.
Patrik Schick led the supply users with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
“How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance,” Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Defensive player Christopher Lenz, who for the first time since the fourth match day and his overcome muscle injury, was also on the spot, stressed the morale of his teammates.
“I think our mentality is incredibly big,” said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
Glasner wants to keep the focus on the next tasks, but also looks well-positioned with regard to the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top-down constitution.
It is top-notch work in our medical department, but players also live highly professional lives.
Now you want to "go step by step and stay modest" and "go through the tasks until the change of year" at this level.
Next is an away game at Borussia M<0xC3><0xB6>nchengladbach (18.30 a.m., Sky) on the programme already on Wednesday in the course of the English week.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again, or do I have to wait for the money to be returned and resend the order?
Unfortunately for me, it would be called that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Handball women's damper ahead of quarter-finals against Spain
Germany's handball women slender after humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes from the parquet.
To finish the World Cup main round, the DHB selection in the 16:32 (8:13) fielded a bitter defeat to 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to run against host Spain in the quarter-finals.
“We were way too scared and had too much respect for the opponent,” said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
This was a bad game for all of us, which we have to delete," said Captain Emily B<0xC3><0xB6>lk.
In the fight for entry to the semi-finals, a significant increase will have to be made against the 2019 World Cup second on Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
Best German pitcher in the duel with the three-time Olympic winner Denmark was quarterback Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - not in the attack, not in the defense," backroom player Xenia Smits said, urging: "We have to look forward now quickly."
From front to back not on the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team with the touchdown was not up to the level.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 rebound after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal came to the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-attack.
However, this was not the expected initial inflammation.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly stand in the scene - and if they did, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavians.
At 3:10 the game was running early after 20 minutes, especially when backroom player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later due to a hard foul on her opponent’s player.
However, in the quarter-finals she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection get a little better in the game and at least five goals until the break.
However, the only quiet hope for a recovery chase after the switch was already after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener defenders sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-deserved opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to appeal to a performance increase and went as a clear loser of the parquet.

The title suggests that I am working as a vaccine doctor in mobile vaccine teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is being vaccinated in nursing homes.
As these are soon to be completed to a large extent, it is then partly going on in vaccination centers for me.
I like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects, and also medical questions, unless they are related to a personal one (e.g. "I take medication X, it tolerates vaccination.").
In my area of responsibility is the clarification for the vaccination, the indication position (person is entitled to a vaccination according to corona vaccination regulations and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (we never happen).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccine teams, however, we often don’t have any, but “only” (for God’s sake don’t want a lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, but they can’t carry out vaccinations (can’t?), so I do most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What, please, is a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger, in the BR television show "We in Bayern" was provided for intense reflection.
But unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" this time was left untouched by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And neither does anyone “who has to go fast”.
That, people heard from the TV moderator, is completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg communicated the solution to this, and thus probably surprised many of the chief priests.
"The Huidler," the spectators learned, "is a patch with which someone wipes the oven".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bavarian television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the remark, this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known word of mouth "holding".
This closed an educational gap - probably even for some who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books in two weeks.
There is always the following error message after confirmation: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connecting, syncing and repairing the PC.
Nothing's helped.
Tyre selection at the race bike- really so pan-safe?
This morning I woke up full of tactile excitement because I wanted to train at least a little more in preparation for my bike tour next week.
That said, done and I drove with my race bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) was a blast.
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud skiing and my rear tyre didn’t want to take the rest of the route at all.
Because I had no real way of getting a replacement jacket and a replacement hose due to the weekday, I had to turn around with half a bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn’t technically that bad either, maybe it’s even better if I practice it with the change of tyres before the bike tour.
But now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would get extremely unnerving of this problem more often.
Now it wasn’t really bad, as the old tyres were also from the previous owner (very nice old man, the day I came to pick up the bike I broke down 120km!) and who had already described them as suboptimal because he has been with them for several years.
But if I think that I still have to make a tire change when driving after 80-90kms, then I think I’m really bad :D
Now I have come to a conversation with an older man on the track, who wondered why I didn’t have the Marathon Plus tyres; these should be unflattable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so incapacitated?
I have little desire to spend 40<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>/tire now, only to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I have 25x622 at the moment on the race bike.
There are also (apparently?) the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you recommend me to other tyres in general on a race bike?
The Schwalbe side seems to me absolutely! I would rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and welcome!
Auto slams against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old was hit on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unexplained cause against a central island and then got on the opposite lane, police said.
There came a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old’s car was then dragged against a tree and the man stuck in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new B 100-6 OHM high-end band, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would be able to grow again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new sprayer and visually recalls the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a suitable designer foot is included directly to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
It has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
Due to the principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people, where the maximum volume plays a more subordinate role, but a sound level is to be achieved at an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered such large sound pressure levels.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal tuned the SOLO 15 with a slight high-tone rise.
This is generally the case with widebands in order to optimize the greatly increasing banding at too high frequencies.
Precisely oriented to the listening area, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Easily turned outwards, the high-tone range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an enemy dynamic that is looking for the same.
The SOLO 15 thus not only complements our SOLO series, but expands them in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our construction kits, it is recommended to think about the final optics of the speaker at the beginning in order to plan corresponding changes in the construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the housing, the reduction of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer again bears material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the appropriate location, in order to be able to carry out the cable without any problems later on.
With the help of an upper milling machine, the speaker opening is now followed in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used flush later.
On the rear side, this opening should be provided with a 45<0xC2><0xB0> phase in order to make the opening surface of the loudspeaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
Then you start with the actual structure of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of it.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are glued to them.
The three pins should also be used and glued.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, if, for example, one wants to resort to finished slabs from the construction market instead of making them themselves from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
After that, all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front follow.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a forest drill, the attachment of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection clamp to the rear wall, is facilitated.
Then a round milling cutter is used to round up all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the base plate can also be rounded off.
Subsequently, the foot plate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing of wood dust has been cleaned (suction/explosion), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and unshortened cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the foot until the terminal opening and allowed to stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable leads to the speaker opening and lets it hang loosely there as well.
The frequency ranges are then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency ranges, as well as the corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document: Installation manual Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is followed, which is not yet completely closed.
Thanks to the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening and close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
Now the damping follows according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be hit on the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept open.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
Hello to all of you,
> finally we can announce that we will also host the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per switch, so we will be following the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 bean in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – yet we’ll do everything we can to keep the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will go off at about 0:30.
Have you ever cold drinks, plan good food and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
