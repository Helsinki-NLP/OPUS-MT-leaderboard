Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded to him, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and will have a busy schedule.
He will first go to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then includes an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will see its culmination in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the award in the Committee's own enclosure.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that he receives this award by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at the moment.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million euros).
He intends to donate it to charitable works, but he has not yet concretely decided which ones.
His program will then take him along with his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant at that price in the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, that he had the feeling that he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
From the announcement, he said it would be an "invitation to act" for him.
A defender of nature accused of blackmail
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police charged with blackmailing the president of the association Société des protectors de la nature de Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice.
Several times last year he appealed for several construction site procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romov<0xC3><0xA1>, Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police spokesman.
The President of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Society of Nature Protectors is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting bins are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague, everyone can sort their drinks, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on sorting benches at every corner of the street.
What's up with Brno?
There, you would need to take several minutes before finding the appropriate buckets.
I don't mean that we wouldn't sort waste at all in Brno.
But I have the impression that the municipal councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is at the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of buckets dedicated to these wastes.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city centre?
It is a whole science, which requires especially time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found at the moment is the place of Moravia in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't want me to, but it seems damn little to me.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it's not a sinecure either.
So in the end, a lot of my friends don't sort their waste.
Par laissez-faire.
It makes them a trot to get to the buckets.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go throw out a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any lanes of Kounicova street color.
Fortunately, I found the right place to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
After all the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, right?!
It is likely that ecology and so-called aestheticism are not of much interest to the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city all over the country, instead of buying a few extra buckets and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am happy to have been able to reinforce my impression with official statistics after spending some time on the internet.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget removed from pension funds and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the opinion of the government, farmers or even civil servants may lack money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for the interest on state debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make loans for sensitive spending, retirement or sick leave. “It’s just putting the problems back on later, mining the land,” said Janota.
It is necessary to know that on the money borrowed the interest to be paid is increasing and that it will be necessary to return it sooner or later.
The state doesn’t really have a choice as to where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social assistance or its expenses, it will have to raise taxes.
To all those whom the left has now increased: the firemen, the teachers, the farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and should not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a larger state debt - next year it will not be missing 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will thus grow more and more rapidly and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The state will need money to pay it back and it will no longer be enough to increase the VAT slightly or decrease maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
It will also miss five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly already decided and started sections of which it is not possible to modify the projects in order to reduce costs if necessary.
Keep them at the very least, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major construction sites, and the withdrawal of European funds is also in danger, according to Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very adversarially - it will put into the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ (electricity supplier and distributor) dividends, which the state has for the most part and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no case a bottomless well.
Last year, it was 18 billion that were navigated from the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement pension accounts, or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 per cent of GDP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations to victims of communism and crimes, even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay for it anyway, notes Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the department side or, in the worst case, touch the government's budget reserve.
There is also a $100 million shortfall in the two-billion-dollar state fund project, which must allow online monitoring of each administration's expenditures.
The first stage will begin in January.
If the finance minister could not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed are promising.
One button is enough and you can switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in staff and professional
Both will work at the same time, VMware’s Srinivas Krishnamurti said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and a first demonstration of it was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is by no means a fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, from a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, which was simultaneously running the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now collaborating with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to devices running in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains haunts hoteliers
The desert tracks are not a problem only for climbers.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users browse the offers, ask for the prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n, it is better not to hesitate too much to book.
If we give priority to the savings and the quality of the accommodation comes only afterwards, then we can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of <0xC5><0xA0>pindler currently only offer one week's stays for the New Year.
I think they're going to try again for a while to place them, but they're going to give up on them too and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will rapidly decrease," Jandura said.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> also offers free beds for all winter periods.
The Christmas week we are most interested in at the moment, it is not completely sold.
It still remains free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas breaks,” said Intours Director Petr Schiefert.
The tourist agency of Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> can also offer the New Year in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fourteen days of February leave just as well, the remaining winter stays sell on average.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks are covered during the week, Christmas will also be complete,” says Schiefert.
On the contrary, the occupation of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
There are a few places left for the New Year as well as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the January holiday of the Poles and February sells well too," said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot of J<0xC3><0xA1>nské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B> is also complete at eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in J<0xC3><0xA1>nské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B>.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupation at present.
February is a little lower for the moment but as soon as the snow is going to fall, the interest for stays in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will still grow, said the director of the Omnia hotel, Erik Sporysch.
However, the hoteliers of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be cooler and if there is precipitation, it should be snowing in the mountains.
But then the weather should warm up, inform Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> of the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
United States: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It even becomes comic, the effort with which Barack Obama, president of the sage reputation, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan issue, which he himself considered to be quite simple.
When he finally let his so eagerly awaited doctrine perpetuate, it turned out that he had copied it on carbon paper since Bush’s Iraqi script three years ago.
Not content to use the phrase "as in Iraq" in the text several times, he did not hesitate, what is more, to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A New Road Forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements into a civil war-consumption Iraq as “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its aftermath.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, which emanated from the campaign commanders’ recommendations, was the only one possible and likely to succeed to such an extent that the newspapers at the moment do not speak at all about Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that said, objectively speaking, he left his successor in a much more favorable final situation than one could hope for.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will resurface
Once again, it was the campaign commanders who asked for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reluctance to subordination.
He asked 40,000 men to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, he at least scammed the general of 10,000 soldiers.
It succeeded in removing the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though it originally numbered 10,000.
What is causing the most problems in Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies of Afghanistan within 18 months and complete the whole process within three years. The whole of Obama’s doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase of half will bring the same fruit as progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the exact opposite - one cannot count on anyone and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing from leader to day according to what arranges them.
The political institutions, though officially founded, will only remain of the powder in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is uniquely complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups, given the lack of clarity regarding the reports, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "quick state to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy makes him confused by his voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and it is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the turmoil of war for their "quick return home" will bring a real miracle there.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible as the Taliban will view it as an indirect sign of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the Europeans’ willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is oriented towards the negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their constituents how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the tightened sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will find themselves faced with the very difficult issue of solving the problem through the use of military force.
It will be necessary, for example, to respond at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only downside for Obama is the fact that there is three years left until the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time left for him to plan a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank leaders will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior management employees of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company has announced that it will respond to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell until five years.
The actions can be withdrawn from the leaders in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of the effort to link salaries with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the overall meaning that needs to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan
The concern is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after putting aside nearly $17 billion for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the advent of the financial crisis, the banking sector’s strong bonuses have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to pay a single 50 percent tax on banker bonuses exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields other than physics.
There are five women, a record number, who today received the Nobel Prize in technical disciplines and literature in Stockholm from the Swedish King Charles XVI Gustave.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine with their compatriot Jack Szostak for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for elucidating the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last laureate received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn’t win this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel Prize and the certificate of achievement of the monetary award.
It reaches ten million Swedish crowns in each category. (approx. 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has multiple winners, they will share the reward between them.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been presented this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward since he is only at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the discharge of his policy, he added that in some situations war is necessary to achieve peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who postpones his stay in the government due to his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further undermines the public finances crisis.
It was the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss her role Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to Klaus’ signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, on Wednesday, the Chamber of Deputies validated the left's proposals on money transfers and increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the social democrats for the fact that they were going to indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a disagreement that called into question the future of Fischer's cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the SDG, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as voted by MPs, removes the package of austerity measures passed by the Fischer government, which he believes should end the government's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the state budget but doesn’t require it, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that policies have long neglected the “serious problem” of the “irrefutable deficit” of public finances.
Now, according to him, there is no favorable solution.
Only a strong government could bring about an improvement if it could build on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
SDG President Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said the budget was suffocating and that the government should question its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "dramatic verdicts".
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD leader Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek reacted to Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek government is exhausting and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD has successfully called the ratification of the state budget for next year.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie Invictus - Invaincu will expose the world a lot of things about the country, its struggles and its victories.
The story is about sport, race relations, and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an Oscar-winning American actor, plays the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said it was an eighteen-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to him, “If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who has been awarded such an award for his role in Clint Eastwood's important drama Million Dollar Baby located in the middle of the boxing scene has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery that has never become a slave, a fictional U.S. president, and even a villain.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his hard work in favor of ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invincible and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois to unify the country. President-elect Mandela knows that his country is still standing and still divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is convinced to be able to unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the world-class outsiders.
The South African team will eventually advance to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela’s story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role in order to bring it closer to reality,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was, of course, talking like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind bars before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I hold your hand, I recover your energy, it transmits itself and I had the impression of knowing how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I called at the door of the house, he opened me up and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look a lot bigger in the movie.'
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus under the guidance of director Eastwood received positive reviews and even talked about ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well-made film."
In the film ratings on the site rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of aura in Norway is solved: the Russians tested a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry has only admitted to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the Bulava-type missile that was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army gradually becomes the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in missile tests did not have the expected effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava did not fly, or it did damage in full flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as a "missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that does not fly but shines
This 13th test was conducted normally at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the equipment.
It is clearly the engine on the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew off the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be precisely set on fire by a moving and submerged vessel
This is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object has probably been caused by a faulty "Bulava".
The Norwegians did not hesitate for a moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals argue that this time, we can't talk about absolute failure.
The first two floors of the rocket resisted and the crash only affected the third.
In the previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first floor.
Even though none of the test launches have been without hooks, the Department of Defense's management believes that only six out of thirteen have been failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and so they always say that one day Bulava will fly without problems and that it will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetissov has signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will be back in a professional match at 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend a hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will likely make his entry in the Friday match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his 40-year career in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kulash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details on the form, says club coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the event of his return to the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most success.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he won twice the gold at the Olympic Games, seven world championships, he won the Canada Cup as well as the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected honors in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency on Monday.
A spokesman for the Hyundai plant, Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, confirmed it.
However, the management still wants to agree with the unions on a working Saturday this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why overtime volunteers were offered on Saturday, December 19 knowing that there would be two teams, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
The website Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz said the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the working day on 28 November.
The company, according to Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, has decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for additional hours.
Either they receive the supplement for extra hours, or they can apply for a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their stated Van<0xC4><0x9B>k end-of-year holidays.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and for their lunch.
Given the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hot spot in the comments and demands of the unions as employees who stopped production spontaneously last week, the management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, workers at the car factory were forced to work almost every day for two extra hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the strike after the signing of the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car plant and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday they were ready to end the strike if they agreed on their demands and signed a joint document.
The situation at the plant culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to incessant additional hours.
They also protested against the poor conditions of wages and alleged bribery.
The management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work extra to meet the requirements for the production of automobiles.
At the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions also called for no sanctions to be imposed on employees who stopped production.
Trade unions are calling on society to reduce time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a salary of 5,000 crowns (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>209) for these.
The Hyundai car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started serial production last year in November.
It produced about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "hard" HIV viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed an immunity to drugs.
This reality is, in some cases, dominated by the fact that the combination does not act as intensively on the common variants of the virus as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
However, it is possible to radically extend the lives of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a number of side effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what are called resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way in a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarborans act on the protein responsible for HIV virus multiplication.
Metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers’ work leads them to discover new “improved” substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bindings to the virus’ proteins.
The metallocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages are formed by the atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little lower but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test specimens as well as on its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical drugs, but it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which the current drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications are therefore interesting combinations to examine more to focus on the development of effective drugs against HIV.
Dispute over the budget. The SDG takes on Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the SDG (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek, called the budget ratified for the following year “offending” and said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the SDG's statements a drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the head of the government should decide whether to learn from the House of Deputies on the basis of the minority that is concerned with combating the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned that the positions of the SDGs and social democrats on the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified the 2010 budget on Wednesday, with proposals for amendments amounting to NOK 12 billion included by the left.
The Chamber increased the money for civil servants' salaries, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance against the proposals of the social democrats was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The SDG left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that a modified budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and worthlessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will continue to reflect on the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota threatened to resign in the event of ratification of the amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made a meeting with the Prime Minister on Monday following his transition to government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering if he would remain in his duties.
His disappointment about the negotiations around the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as believes that the representatives of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, who have imposed budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifys other laws increasing the deficit such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or reform of the Services Act.
Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek: Ministers appointed by the SDG are not in question.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and the entire government.
Ministers appointed by the SDG have done nothing harmful, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said in a textual statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries are demanding TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the amount of the public finances deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of Democrats.
I didn’t think about it and once it’s on the agenda then I will dedicate myself to it,” Defense Minister Martin Bart<0xC3><0xA1>k, who was elected to the government by the Democrats, told reporters in the House.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a European Council debate in Brussels.
The SDG has stepped back at the Prime Minister's request.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed at the same time that the SDG would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not explicitly asked Democratic MPs to allow the budget to be voted on.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not little children, he responded to the question of whether the SDG had not been blamed by the President of the Party in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I did not realize that my vote would have been missed.
I already knew at the time that I had given up my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a Bolshevikization of the House and the destruction of everything that was positive, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek reacted in person.
According to the new schedule of the <0xC4><0x8C>D there will be fewer trains for identical fares.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit some less loaded express or regional trains from 13 December and will strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will fall on the day the new timetables come into effect by two per cent compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including base rates and reduced rates.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolin branch.
On the contrary, an express ceased to serve Bratislava.
There will also be fewer trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line, while the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové region of eight per cent in total, while Prague and its surrounding areas can enjoy an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - T<0xC3><0xA1>bor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line are also cancelled and the circulation of a few express trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will be reduced to only a few days a week.
Among the biggest transformations, one can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem and Milovice.
The long-distance lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague Main Station (Prague Hlavn<0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>).
The <0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will depart at intervals of two hours.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year for regional railways: an additional 200 million crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year in a total of four billion crowns to settle the visible losses, i.e. the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them by a total of eight billion in the next year.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciates the system, which also explains that they did not use a price increase for the vast majority of transport titles.
The changes will only affect one-day <0xC4><0x8C>D Net tickets and discounted eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will again depend on the route travelled, while so far it was valid between cities of a chosen region and was at a unique rate of 160 crowns.
Philippine rebels still detain more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels today abducted 75 people in the southern Philippines, including a few elementary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed, but only spoke at the origin of 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields during an escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP news agency, the police first pursued the kidnappers as a result of violence caused during an account settlement between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines due to a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the election of the governor’s administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of this province of the southern Philippines was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in American theaters in the next few days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned anti-apartheid fighter returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody it.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the feedback from critics and the audience is heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes since it is presented at a time when, on the one hand, South Africa is in full preparation for the World Cup, and on the other hand because the media are agitated by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants on the other hand.
According to the AP, the reactions to the new film are currently rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations issued towards the main roles where Hollywood stars "paving".
Morgan Freeman is, however, proud of the film in his own words.
I dreamed of this role for many years and I was well prepared.
“I’ve also met Nelson Mandela many times in person to be able to – as they say – recover his energy,” he said at the film’s first official in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember Mandela’s personality and message through the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each individual, he added.
Wear the jersey of the national rugby team
The film based on the story of British writer John Carlin's novel, the title being freely translated, in the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his tenure as president.
Morgan Freeman then tries during the film to pick up two racial groups from a long-divided population, and so does Nelson Mandela in 1995, dressed in the South African team's national jersey on the World Cup lawn, which South Africa had won at the time.
To have been shown on the lawn in jersey, which is considered something sacred in South Africa, Mandela had long been ovated fourteen years ago mainly from the white public and was recognized by white populations.
Let’s hope the football championship will succeed in bringing people back together in a single nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only “black” of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
The South African whites are, however, skeptical as recently confided in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire engulfed in the morning a transformer from the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps of the distribution center near the municipality of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov na Lounsku.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, spokesman for the fire department of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer consume itself, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the spokesperson of the company Pavla Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission set.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She adds that in ten years of activity, the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps has not known anything like this and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electric power supplies have not been interrupted, says the spokesman of the company <0xC4><0x8C>EZ for North Bohemia Son<0xC5><0x88>a Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and electric lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transport sets to distribution sets and lines tracks with a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura to file defamation complaint against three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD prefects
Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, owner of Student Agency, will file a complaint today for defamation against three Democratic social prefects.
And concretely against Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek of the South Moravia region, against Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura pointed it out in Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l's Twenty Minutes.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three attacked us and claimed that we made the fine mouths, while we only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So we only have to defend ourselves.
It is in exchange for slander on the Student Agency company, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l.
Similarly, he indicated that there is evidence that no region has taken action in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for this to the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek believes that Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s filing of a complaint represents the continuation of his media show that serves him as a free advertisement for his company and for his person.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who manipulates public opinion and makes false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million crowns in an ad that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l that he stopped the campaign after Christmas and that he intends to resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura began its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing tenders.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, such a way of acting is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura threats from a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I do not know who it is but I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already rising, saying mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against high-risk pneumococcals.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for the children of August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal infections.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
Yet the parents paid 1600 crowns or even more for one dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that each year health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 crowns in vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 crowns a year on all vaccinations for children.
Reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 caused by pneumococcal infections.
In addition to the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced reimbursed vaccinations.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions about a possible obligation to vaccinate in the future.
As of January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> indicated that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference that our association participated in, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think it is a direction that needs to be followed now," Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not considering it at all for the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>, president of the Society for Paediatrics, acknowledges that a vaccination based on volunteering has its flaws.
If all children were vaccinated, however, a reduction in vaccination renewals could be envisaged "In the situation where the vaccine costs such an amount I understand the decision making the vaccination optional", says Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Experts predict that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their babies.
Pneumococcal vaccination also marks a break from the fact that it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products.
However, this is related to the concerns of pediatric practitioners, who are concerned with the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to purchase the vaccines by insurance, the doctors receiving them in the same way as the other vaccine products provided by the state.
However, some MPs feared that this would allow insurance companies to "deduct the amounts of health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to reimburse them.
According to estimates, pediatricians will have to invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The son of an American artist involved in a “Museum Flight”
Frank Frazetta’s son, a well-known illustrator, has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (<0xC2><0xA3>12 million) in his father’s museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been interned while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance to the museum, in the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) reported.
The AP quoted a police official as saying the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, Mr Frazetta Jr, 52, claims to have been allowed by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr Frazetta Senior has never given such permission, the agency said.
The Labour Party supports the increase in the budget tax.
The ministers defended the tax increase and spending cuts announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, companies and unions.
The Tories said Alistair Darling "failed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by delaying his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted the slums by attacking low wages and middle wages.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in Social Security and a 1% ceiling on public wages from 2011 onwards.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages are penalized by a recession they are not responsible for and warned that “problems” were being announced.
The decrease in social insurance – which will get about GBP 3 billion a year – has angered the world of business, because according to him, it is a job tax while the goal should be a boost to the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
PRINCIPAL POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Security will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
The increase in the tax on the profits of the company for small companies has been abandoned
Reductions in taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to the Treasury estimates, a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 per year will earn <0xC2><0xA3>110 more.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 was “difficult decisions” but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would weigh on the top 5 percent of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, rejected an increase in tax and pointed out that a decrease in spending was a "drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, they will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely indispensable over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident and that growth in the economy would restart at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts of economic growth - which will influence the amount it will borrow and the rate at which the deficit will be met - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely fall by 4.75% this year – far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while the loan would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"A missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new ad campaign warning against Labour's "debt crisis" on Thursday, said the plan to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, eclipsing "cynically" difficult choices until after the elections - which are due to take place in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, chief secretary of the Ghost Cabinet Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
"Significant announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from upcoming cuts, contrary to Tory's proposals that would lead to a faster and more significant reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems said the money raised through rising taxes and falling spending would be used to support next year’s spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that plans were “built on the wind.”
Nick Robinson, the BBC’s political editor, said that the schedule of announcements — such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned above — would leave the Chancellor facing accusations of propaganda, with the money simply being recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Faux budget"
Although ministers did not publish spending details beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that government spending restrictions would only begin to make themselves felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institute of Fiscal Studies) stated that the Chancellor’s figures involve substantial reductions in many areas in the future, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“The pain is actually only delayed,” said its Director, Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner,” said Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s Economic Advisor to the Accountants.
"This has been a false pre-budget report, and the markets are well aware of it."
FBI Investigates ‘American Arrests in Pakistan’
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been reported missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of State said it was also looking for information on these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges against them are and under what conditions they are detained,” said spokesman Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, a spokesman for the FBI, said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are being carried away,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of them's uncles.
The woman said that the house was already under surveillance by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency reported, but said the United States had to "collaborate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recuse people".
The five students had been taken missing from their homes by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iran's "abuse"
In the last twenty years, human rights have been respected as little as ever, according to Amnesty International.
the report presents "repeations of violations" by the regime, before and after the presidential election campaign in June.
One man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes and another said he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticisms of its failure to respect human rights.
The authorities claimed that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens have been killed in Iran after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent says.
"Fausse confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, always in blood and half conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the candidate who lost the election, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
Iranian authorities have denied allegations of rape, but admitted abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was locked in a container with 75 other people, for more than eight weeks, in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty accepted that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election unrest and the government’s response, but said that the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested over the past three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn the Bristol site into a race track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park track, a small trenches preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but that it was quite intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city shining in double bass.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talents," he added.
Prices have rewarded the best turns - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night’s party, the snow will be abandoned to cast iron.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French don't like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Bowen’s latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious plot.
Good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in the mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen and reproduce discussions between teachers and students on the issues that concern them the most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim Use an Interest-Based Banking System to Get a Loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
Intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their legal counterparts of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia which today constitute a small part of the Muslims of Europe.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the laity of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wonders how much the French politicians (and the so virulent intellectual elite of secularism) are actually committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not deceived, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a “thickness of key values.”
After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Aware of the history and complicated policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who made their mark by hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then a courageous 14-year-old aspirant who had to fight only the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured as they were swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show brought together 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the surface needed for a free adult. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to the algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often goes back to the threat hunters pose to species survival.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter hunters and Inuit motorskiers use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that ice will remain for the longest.
In his new book, “After the Ice,” Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating insight into what might be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately relate to the speed of change.
It's not your fault to try.
Late 19th and early 20th, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering voyages gave the first information about the melting of the ice sheet.
The submarines of the Cold War then mapped the relief changes of the submarine.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on the icebergs are of great help, but the biggest of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and minuscule world of the Arctic ice tax system, formed by seawater nets pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, maybe it will be our turn.”
Marines, among the 6,000 people who deposited crowns on the graves in Arlington
The 19-year-old De'Angello Robinson made a seven-hour bus trip to lay a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who were once in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place," Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers to gather on Saturday morning to lay crowns on the graves of veterans in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and other people decided to decorate several hundred tombs in the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen, travel every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the memorial site for the victims of Flight 93 from Penksy, United Airlines.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a dead career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It’s a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops,” she said.
It’s like visiting a family grave.
Emmitted in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extensive hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers have chosen ancient tombs, dating back to the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Vietnam War, as these are not as often visited as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and the couples held hands, carrying the fresh pine crowns on the grey graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Close by, there was silence on Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Some people were crying without hiding, others were praying, and families and friends were supporting each other in the cold air.
Some were reading aloud the names engraved on the stone while others were bending to see the small black and white information cards, immersed in the wet earth for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears, on her son’s grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and had driven eight hours to gather on the grave of Marine Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget what we're free to do... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him."
A U.S. Citizen Arrested by Cuban Authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. citizen who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, the U.S. Department of State said.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are married and they are followed and harassed by government agents.
S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has made several requests to leave the country to go for rewards, but the authorities have always refused him.
The detention of a U.S. citizen may increase tensions between the brothers’ communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which pursues a “sweet” approach to improving relations with the island.
The arrest announcement was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although either new and desired consumer goods in a country or an employee’s average salary is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the rare American incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press associate with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed to -- distribute mobile phones for free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the country's failure to do so.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, as the two countries begin to engage in better dialogue.
Pakistani Authorities Prevent Conspiracy to Send Men to Afghanistan <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization allegedly preparing a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan in order to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle an important network of recruiters of terrorists who are spying on the Internet in search of young radica men.
Investigators said they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were led by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan’s tribal belt, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the northeast which became a refuge from terrorism.
They were seen as infiltrating agents.
That is why they were dismissed, said a representative of the authorities who expressed himself on the condition of anonymity due to the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities claimed that the men were determined and that they were still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to gain entry into the al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the September 11, 2001, attacks, U.S. secret services have prioritized infiltrating men in the al-Qaida network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of gatekeepers, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups also need to pay more and more attention, in recent years in choosing the people they accept because U.S. secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment model than so many other people have already followed?
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen are calling for climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched in the streets here on Saturday, calling for more climate action from negotiators working in the city’s Bella Convention Center.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000 people, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit some explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On this day when little has happened during climate talks sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists have walked from the city, deploying banners in English saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, stating "The Earth says it's enough".
Several celebrities joined the protests, including top Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother’s home country, Peru, opened her eyes to the ripple problems the country has to face because of the impact of climate change that is already happening.”
That’s one of the reasons why I decided to join the grand march — to pass the word and call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions,” she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella centre and said she had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of handcuffs.
Police prevented protesters from coming too close to the Bella centre and said she had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of handcuffs.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous due to his involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing masks and black clothes, lit several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were throwing them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by “some big explosions.”
Inside the Palais des Congr<0xC3><0xA8>s, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters have failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s representative for the climate.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "Actually, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then went on to say in Mandarin, "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that walking might seem harmful or useful depending on the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and the different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others.”
The results of the tests reveal tenacious differences between the races
Last week’s federal report on math scores brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District remains far behind the headquarters, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are in much greater progress over the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, at both local and national levels.
Average results of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in Washington, D.C. have increased, over the past two years, from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) is generally constant, falling by only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average result of the whites was not included in the test results as the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overall view over a six-year period is no longer encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 (cm1), when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by the children in the two groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the Group Director of Educational Institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) was driven by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality in district education.
I’m not jumping for one or two points earned,” said Kwame R. Brown (Democratic Appearance), D.C. Council Member and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee’s management style, Brown stated that the message of the test results is that the city’s middle schools (colleges) desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what’s scary is that we don’t devote enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at elementary and early-college schoolchildren who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier in their schooling and who are rather late compared to their peers.
Each day, the mathematics program, for Kindergarten classes (maternal) at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the last NAEP reported the week.
I just think we need to continue to work to offer better interventions to these lower-level students than in the classroom,” Rhee said.
Others believe that the results of NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing the money and resources for schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional policy solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington.
Also, this targeting can have political repercussions that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other Superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, no matter where they come from, are assured that their children will be able to get excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements to reducing the success gap was the length of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the District of Washington, to be in competition with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "starting point" to get yet another increase in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise of the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, descends and blinks a moment’s eye at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela’s parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students from the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of a new impressed student than enthusiastic.
Super That's where I'm going to study! exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, while the guide led them towards the entrance to the building of science.
"Youpi, really?" she said, thinking, when she was told the low ratio law teacher - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh to visit children during their three-day discovery trip and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this question still arises largely for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from the university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, “a second-generation Hispanic out of five pushed his high school education—a remarkable achievement if one considers that both of their immigrant parents, most of them from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, they are paving the way for the next generations who will play an important role in the country’s workforce.
Researchers who study batsmen claim that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to university -- in particular, if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who tutored them.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela University visit is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepared to you), it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize college preparation programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of the years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq’s oil ministry gets deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies in order to rebuild its struggling infrastructure during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the recovery of Iraq’s oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and san.
U.S. companies are split with a stake in only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday.
The only one who put up an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies obtained contracts for the auctioned fields in June.
The low representation of U.S. oil giants in opening up the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asian and European companies that are opening the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet news site.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops retreated, have hampered U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the third-largest oil reserve in the world.
U.S. companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labor costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they did not have to account for shares.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and brought their technical advice to him, have been left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more focused on contracts than other companies and is split up with significant stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological powerhouse, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected companies to submit auctions made bids that were then compared to the per barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of al-Qaida's main organizers reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that a U.S. missile, which struck along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organisers of al-Qaida operations this week, U.S. counter-espionage authorities said Friday.
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second murderous attack against one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles fired into their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles had been fired by a drone of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan’s anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of Pakistan’s civilian secret services, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
Authorities said the suspected local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of "totally shredded bodies".
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as one of Al Qaeda’s Responsible Military Organisers who were leading the group’s terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to keep the anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of airstrikes within Pakistan's territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second U.S. official said Somalia had progressed rapidly in al-Qaida’s ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the American public, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies," the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somalia would be the second major figure in al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have advanced to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site says.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul Withdraws
U.N. special envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate fraught with widespread allegations of corruption during the U.N.-backed presidential elections.
Eide’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the U.S. timetable for troop withdrawals starting in 18 months and forcing other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
“We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community,” Eide said in a Kabul phone interview.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign but would simply respect the commitment he made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives claim that the name of Staffan di Mistura has been cited; he is an Italian-Swiss citizen who recently presided over a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guehenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide’s reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential election and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but said Galbraith's accusations -- which was thanked -- "have hurt the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism regarding international election observation."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the assistance of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than he is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration about the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy U.N. hiring regulations hampered his ability to bring new talent.
“The UN rules are such that I have only been able to recruit one person since May,” he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Friday that the world’s major powers would soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a detachment of 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the possibility of such an outcome.”
One of the things that weighs me the most is that if I have learned one thing in Iraq in the last six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some of those sanctions could also affect street Iranians.
He said a "set of motivations and punishments" could be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring back its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council's UN Security Council and its UN agency.
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume dialogue on reducing his nuclear program and agree to abandon a significant part of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a way to develop trust on both sides and to save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have distanced itself from attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States or not.
Frankly, in my opinion, Iran’s reluctance to face some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually agreed at the beginning of October has prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in on what they had not considered, in terms of additional significant sanctions against Iran.
President Obama set December 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before turning to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement made Thursday in New York, Iran’s mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls “unsubstantiated allegations” by some members of the Security Council on Iran’s nuclear activities and said it was long in agreeing to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers.
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the plane for the rich Kurdish oil region to meet the troop leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the Kurdish anxiety about the ongoing withdrawal, US authorities quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you.”
In ageing China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by banners chanting, “Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children” and “An extra baby is an extra grave.”
They learned so well the lesson that the Shanghai Government authorities, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and by the aging population, radically changed direction this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was never instantaneous and firm.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources and who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good toys and cheats, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple to six when the policy was implemented.
The population distribution, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, will rise from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, well above the global average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Shanghai Municipal Population Commission and Family Planning) said that fertile couples had to have babies in order to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a labor shortage".
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A progressive attenuation
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is to this day, unquestionably, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and face discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have given the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority forced pregnant women of a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys to girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007 they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said central government authorities recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters urging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples, at their homes, and drag prospects under their doorsteps.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city in the Shanghai suburb say they have seen an increase in demand for couples’ records wishing for a second child after the campaign's launch, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed to have them.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly believe that the one-child policy is a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
It is true, we are robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitancy.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she only wanted one child because she was one of them. "We were the center of the family and we used to have everyone take care of us."
We don’t have the habit of taking care of someone else and we don’t really want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says it more bluntly.
For middle-class working couples who lower the birth rate, he says, it is necessary to be selfish to succeed.
People in their 20s or 30s grew up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his/her CV to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft plans for emission reduction.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by disorganized allocations and mutual recriminations -- came back under fire from Friday's ramp, due to the publication of a document highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as long as it clarified the way forward.
But it has been seen as a major advance in time-consuming negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Written by a UN task force, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support climate change, in the short term and in the long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production, and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature rise that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN Secretary-General on climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as "the complete picture".
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, by 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and droughts or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, the U.S. Representative for Climate Negotiation, rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison to the voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if they were not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is becoming tougher on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The U.S. will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions by major developing countries, Stern said, adding that he regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after China’s deputy foreign minister, He Yafei, said the U.S. chief negotiator either lacked “good sense” or was “extremely irresponsible” to have said earlier this week that the U.S. would not financially help China fight back.
With the future economic trajectory of the major world powers at stake, shortcomings have emerged both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States arguing over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it was not surprising that major powers were struggling to find out who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold big emitters accountable.
This is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure on a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say the negotiations will lead to a minimum of a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission’s climate unit, said the small island states’ action “put political pressure on the full political process,” partly because they are now unified and ask emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the issues in hand before the heads of government came to an agreement.
High-level officials such as Indian Minister of the Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister descended from their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and information conferences, in order to be able to make claims that will be studied next week.
The true image of the gathering -- during which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palais des Congr<0xC3><0xA8>s every day -- of guitar player activists present nightly shows mocking countries who, according to them, betray themselves and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all major ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of the greats,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for the global policy of Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday’s syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle blow will pierce the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will line from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
He hopes the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The small lost holes will become thriving suburban cities, the duration of business trips will be much shorter, and the passage of the plane and the train car will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle, and fears of environmental dangers are likely to slow down the UK’s high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next planned step for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn in the five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment could be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up up to 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also expected to present three options for a larger high-speed network, heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two at or near Birmingham, with one branch going west of the Pennines in Manchester and Scotland and another going northeast, towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It looks like it's going to be the best performance option," said one rail professional.
When done, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour trip currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains of 400m length and can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is planned that an existing station will be expanded to receive the network at high speed.
Rail industry experts state that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
The trains will first be required to run off high-speed lines on existing tracks north of Birmingham, maintaining travel times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure the passage of aircraft to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan for Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, a senior member of the Tory parliament, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to pay back the cost of an orangery he built in his county house.
The party official, who was backed by David Cameron to complain that members of parliament were "maintained", increased his loan of <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The authorities of the Commons received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a control of the members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan said that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his county of Rutland - Melton.
The neighboring houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the emoluments office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on the Privileges and Standards of the Commons concerning his prior borrowing arrangements.
The Committee acquitted him last month of any charges of non-compliance with the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 loan from his London property to the home of his constituency he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 per month of interest on loans until March last year.
In April, his demands increased by more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at the time, suggesting that all increases were intended to fund the loan of <0xC2><0xA3>75,000.
The RBS variable standard interest rate rose from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as head of the ghost office in September, after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him stating that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
"Actually, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated as "of the m...e"
He said: “I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was right.
I could have asked for more, but I didn’t.”
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil negotiator, began to have to explain his spending in May, after it appeared that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the office of expenses that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a <0xC2><0xA3>-shaped hole in Mr Duncan’s lawn, to protest after it was revealed he had asked for <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing, Mr. Duncan said last night: "It was for capital improvements, approved by both the expense bureau and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of undressing or developing or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It couldn’t have been clearer or simpler.”
Faithful, come all to see the calendar of the Advent of Brighton
Brighton’s beach cabins have found a new way to promote for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., every day, with pasta and hot wine served for free.
The Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest of the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
“As a Church, why do we expect people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the Church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
"The idea of the Advent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to experiment and represent it through spirituality.”
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and around the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people protested on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate change, across the world and in Copenhagen, where police conducted several hundred interpellations.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, in charge of reaching an agreement that could come into force by Friday, January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, helped to make the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
Incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the start of the procession, when a group of 300 protesters, fully dressed in black, broke windows with pavings and hammers, a AFP journalist said.
Anti-riot police officers immediately intervened without housekeeping.
In total, the police announced the interpellation of 600 to 700 people, mainly according to them members of the "Black Blocks", these ultra-violent groups, which were particularly illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were called "unintelligible", noting that a hundred of them "were always held in the street Saturday night" "reduced and held in a cold-seated position.
From Parliament, the courtier, rather a good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, the site of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without looking to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of protesters had come by car and train from the major cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
“Today, we’re going down the streets to ask for the repair of the South’s ecological debt,” said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say to ourselves: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, streams where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alternative world movement has become closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to “link climate justice and social justice”: “today, there is no disconnect between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world.”
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had given way to sending demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had gone down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, planting bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, rallies of a few hundred protesters also took place to call for vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, a few dozen people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow recognized Georgia's pro-Russian separatist region, while Tbilisi denounced a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the Russo-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The turnout rate was 58% a few hours before the close, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates in a row, including outgoing president Sergey Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the vote.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia fell under the total occupation of Russia," his spokesman Manana Manjgaladzé said.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world regards it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
“This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state,” Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential race in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the Black Sea coast.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed a little everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, reserved a warm welcome for Russian officials who came to monitor the conduct of the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, in reference to the support of Moscow, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations," said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting a glass of vodka.
For his part, the opposition represented in the vote by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, as the one giving Russia control over the 10 abkha railways.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims to support neither the current power nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be held within two weeks.
Climate: events in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on who lives, detained nearly 700 people on the sidelines of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, one hundred thousand according to the organizers, paraded in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that will come into force on January 1, 2013.
Part of Parliament, the cortege, generally good child, took the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to get into it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the planned speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the procession left, a group of several hundred protesters, fully dressed in black, equipped with bricks and hammers, broke through the windows, a AFP journalist said.
Anti-riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened without housekeeping, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the interpellation of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups, which were particularly illustrated at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the interpellation of about twenty people, according to police.
We looked at the extremist group, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen had warned, while the helicopters of the law enforcement forces were shooting in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came by car and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
“Today, we’re going down the streets to ask for the repair of the South’s ecological debt,” said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say to ourselves: we have time, said the Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, there are streams where you can walk while you have never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alternative world movement has become closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of alternative globalism, told AFP he had come to Copenhagen for "a link between climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no disconnect between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had given way to sending demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had gone down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and waving bandanas waving solar energy in front of the city hall in the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, gatherings of a few hundred protesters have also been held to demand action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, a few dozen people gathered.
Geo-history emerges strengthened from general high school reform, according to Chatel
National Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were "reinforced" from the general high school reform, despite the abolition of their compulsory education in the scientific terminal.
From now on, first-year students will all have four hours a week and the same program for a shared shared common culture, says Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "we need to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S sector is no longer a scientific sector" but "in general, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L chains cannot remain sub-branches of the S, he continues, stressing: "I have also not heard many historians and intellectuals outraged at the absence of the history-geography terminal in the technological lycées."
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in Humanity found that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) disapprove of the government’s plan to abolish mandatory history-geography education in Terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers have also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some are right-wing.
The Minister, however, added that it was "no question" to delete the philosophy of Terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization Tuesday to protest the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass at the beginning of the year an eligibility test that will relate to their discipline, then at the end of the year an admission test that will relate to their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also follow interns during the year of M2 and then be a first year in front of students as intern teachers.
If you add all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister states that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the plan to delete the school card "by 2012".
In Normal Sup, Experts Have 15 Minutes to Convince the Climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge raised on Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by the Higher Normal School of Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a chain of expert interventions, each of fifteen minutes, filmed and open to the public, a AFP journalist noted.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day, who takes his name from the one given by the students to the fish in the school's pool.
Twenty participants are chosen from among the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
"We can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, told AFP, but using graphs, in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will keep in mind that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record".
Videos from these conferences will be posted online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled in February, followed by others at a bi-monthly pace.
Delays in payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
Prison watchers’ unions called for Friday’s “general mobilization” to demand payment by the end of the year of overtime and premiums whose payment was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-Penitentiary (2nd Watchers’ Union) has asked staff who will not be in service to protest in front of the prison facilities on Tuesday morning and "block them", to "denunciate the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitential (3rd trade union) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for strong mobilization", deeming it "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first watchdog union, the Federal Independent Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) to bring back discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were budgeted, but ensure that the balance will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the watchdog unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the director of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation, due to a poor assessment of the number of additional hours, does not recur in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December salary will therefore be lean, except for senior management staff with famous function and objectives bonuses, deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints are well behind".
It is a pure scandal, outraged the regional FO union of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until a new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and public holidays if those in October are not regularized in December, idem for overtime, also threatens FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take the money of the staff, according to the CGT-Penitentiaire de Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less badly populated than others.
But in any case, the account is not there, said the secretary general of the Ufap, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says to offer “better tricks” than he gets
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, confided to the little screen “Pope” Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple gift rule: “I give more cool stuff than I get.”
As part of a special show that airs on ABC on Sunday night, President and his wife Michelle offer an insight into how they intend to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion will be in the game.
Santa also likes Bo, said Michelle Obama, stating that the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama has been falsified against her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year,” she said.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before he could reply with humor by pointing out the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “Who gave you this?”
During this one-hour show, in a relaxed atmosphere, with the famous cheerleader who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
“I remember this time I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and gave me a basketball,” he said.
It was only later in my life that I realized that it was he who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn’t know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse,” said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Claims He's In Artificial Coma
Johnny Hallyday was resuscitated in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his surroundings, while RTL claims the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was resuscitated Wednesday night at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found "injuries resulting from the operation" of the disc hernia suffered in Paris on November 26, the press service said.
The singer’s press service, however, wanted to reassure itself that the situation was “under control”, while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, partner of the singer’s last tour, Johnny Hallyday was, however, plunged into an artificial coma to avoid “pains and complications.”
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he has opened an eye, adds RTL.
Asked by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drain would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for this disc herniation.
The intervention, scheduled for several days had been performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well known in the art world.
This one was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following the operation he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles for a subsequent infection.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but said he was "no worries" about the rocker, who is "a batsman".
“He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was crazy because doing twelve hours of flying after such an operation is not playable,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, saying that Johnny Hallyday “reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics” and that the infection was “encouraged.”
Mr. Camus had also said he had talked to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer’s health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated on with a "small colon cancer", then a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer took over as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health issue has been heavily commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed the singer’s difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: Bousquet’s first on its fetish distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medallist at the 2009 World Cup in the Grand Prix, won an international title on Thursday over a distance he particularly loves, the 50 m free swimming, at the 2009 Euro in the small event in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while one was expected to roll.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relay 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who praised the world record for the 50 m freestyle, of which he holds the mark in the large pool (20.94).
On one of the two distances queens of the swimming, the 50 m free, is the 28-year-old Frenchman who got in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet beat Croatia's Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russia's Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had anticipated.
One can always dream better and in the event, I said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all of the swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their debut in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999 during the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not serve this time to the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the big pool this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer did not succeed in lowering the mark he holds on 400 m free swimming (3:32.77) but nevertheless prevailed by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give a damn about this race.
I knew I couldn’t beat a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: Sarcophagus panel owned by Zola awarded $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded $1.5 million on Thursday, well above his estimate, the art dealer Sotheby's announced.
This two-meter-long front panel on 63 cm high, dating from the 3rd century AD, was estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satires and baccarat, is a rare piece, there are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, vice-president of the Sochi art auctions, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold out of a hundred lots.
The sale is still underway but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have the most expensive so far, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back to a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bathhouse in her particular Parisian mansion, and with Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly before the Council of the President.
It was a shadowy area of about fifty years.
By researching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "succession Emile Zola" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the frescoes of "Rougon-Macquart".
Aborted departure attempt from Zelaya, Honduras to Mexico
Mexico on Thursday considered that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the deposed Honduran president, Manuel Zelaya, who was refused a bailout by the Putschist government.
For now, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not met, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
Arriving Wednesday in Salvador to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government's plane returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migrations.
The Putschist government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and ask for political asylum abroad to grant him a bailout.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as a guest-executive head of state.
The Putschist government “has experienced a new failure in wanting me to give up my position ... they wanted me to resign,” Zelaya told Globo Radio, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, he added, playing some accords the fallen president, who has been a refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has submitted a request for exemption, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an application for asylum, the interior minister of the Putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, told HRN radio on Wednesday.
I do not ask for asylum in any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to take place as president of the Honduran people, he said.
Zelaya’s departure rumors on Wednesday mobilized supporters of the late president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military strengthened their headquarters.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticised the Putschist government’s position.
This demonstrates the marginal character of this government with respect to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he returned by surprise on September 21 and had taken refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he goes out, he will be arrested for the crime of "high treason" charged with justice, according to the Putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial vote recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures showing the resumption of both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, a technology dominant, from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index was awarded 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different branches of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she said, estimating that the market was focusing on "half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the US trade balance figures, “which show that activity improves in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected the deficit to widen.
Imports as well as exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major U.S. trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new U.S. unemployment registrations have risen against expectations last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “has fallen to the lowest in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night and that of the 30-year-old bond to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of Supporters of Power Condemn the “Ladies in White”
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government on Thursday consecrated the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were interned.
Forty "White Ladies", married or close to political prisoners, were seen in the street by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a AFP journalist said.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Vive Fidel and Raul!" were chanting, raising the hand, supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who came to "insure their protection".
On the eve, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "White Ladies" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for the International Day of Human Rights were, they, called by police in civilian, found a AFP journalist.
Police forced dissidents into civilian vehicles who were seen by supporters of the government, according to the journalist.
Interpellations of dissidents under similar circumstances generally last only a few hours.
Recipients of the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize 2005, the "White Ladies" had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", in the number of 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of which 53 remain in detention.
Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be “mercenaries” or “agents” at the expense of their declared enemy, the United States.
Very rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration of pro-government activists against “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of undermining rights and freedoms, including expression.
A forced man kills an octogenarian with a knife and injures 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
An armed forceman with two knives killed an octogenarian and wounded five others in the town centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), an hour's drive away, late Thursday.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker allegedly hit with two knives and for indeterminate reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy on 85 boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, learned from police sources and from witnesses.
Severely injured, the old man, born in 1929, according to a police union official Alliance, died in the hospital following his injuries.
In or in front of this same pharmacy, he then took it to a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, who was in his thirties, interned and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian succumbed.
The other victim’s days are in danger, with vital organs apparently being affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became ill and reportedly was hospitalized in a “shocked state,” according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then escape into the street, always boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
He would have injured two passersby, apparently by chance: a 30-year-old and a four-year-old, the latter seriously.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he was carrying on a cross behind his back, said Arnaud Presse, a union official in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by AFP, tried to control the forced man.
I saw a guy in his 30s with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was ribbed, reported Alberto, a server at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Always boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their manager, tried to interrogate the gunman and were wounded by hand, according to police sources.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passers-by came to tell me that there was a wounded person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a safety position, and I saw a very important wound in the abdomen," Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later a second person in his 30s arrived, wounded by a knife.
They are National Police personnel who have arrested the man with no identity papers.
The Nanterre prosecutor's office has seized the departmental judicial police service of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) from the investigation.
The man was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard as part of his guard.
A police source did not rule out that he was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of over-excitation" as "all the forced of this species whose forces are unleashed under the effect of action."
USA: Polanski’s lawyer again claims to abandon prosecutions
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski’s lawyer once again called for the abandonment of the lawsuit against his client, who is currently assigned to reside in Switzerland for a murder case of more than 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the "Pianist" director's lawyer, denounced serious procedural errors in 1977 in front of three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeals.
I demand that charges be dropped here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behavior of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, was “cold in the back.”
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has since died -- would have discussed, before handing over his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which is a serious procedural flaw.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and wanted" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally stated at the end of September that he had “lied” the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to give up the proceedings, Mr. Hummel requested a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States in 1978, prior to the sentencing, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He's never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Assistant Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing."
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "demands a favor to the court, while disregarding her authority."
One of the three judges — who now have 90 days to make their decision — also stressed "that there are other alternatives to escape".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to demand the abandonment of the prosecutions against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also demanded, once again, the end of the prosecutions.
Recalling that her client can no longer bear to be harassed at every turn of the Polanski affair, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that’s enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to residence in his cottage in Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, halted by dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange ended undirected on Friday, in a market rigged between better indicators than expected in the United States and the rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which “helped improve market opinion on the solidity of economic recovery,” summarized analysts from Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second straight month and much more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also rebounded sharply in December, from 73.4 to 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices were hampered by a new dollar growth, at the highest in the last two months compared to the euro, which “puts down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” explained Owen Fitzpatrick of the Deutsche Bank.
Thus, technological values have lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night and that of the 30-year-old bond to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month’s journey across South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are about to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great beauty fair organized for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportive or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real tourbillon.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I’ve seen a lot of things and experienced so many experiences!, exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I could not dream of a better country to give back my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I’m happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery "of the breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press and safari meetings, the Misses are now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and presented to this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
It's every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launches Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costumes and of course in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by a Chinese TV presenter, Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee manager Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
Like last year, the candidates did a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will probably remain the draw at the Cape Town (south-west) for the June 2010 Football World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been to people I never thought I could approach.
I will definitely return for the 2010 World Cup, excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive", according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," his son David assured Friday on his arrival at Los Angeles airport where he had to go to his father's hospital bed for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's going very well, David Hallyday told the press at his departure from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1pm local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured that he would go "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a disc herniation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "put into an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent her from suffering and to be able to administer her treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection following a herniated disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be resuscitated from Wednesday to Thursday night due to major injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning where their daughter Jade was schooled to attend a school show, a AFP photographer said.
The head of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the Monceau International Park Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outcast, Camus said.
I have heard of a possible future judicial procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday was "going too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it amazed me, given that I myself had two herniated discs, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "going off without a drain, without anything", after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art world.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma following brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulfite reputation, convicted several times by the court, in cases of medical responsibility, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the doctor's lawyer, accused him of being "a man without scruples" prosecuted "regularly" in the Council of the Order, and which is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention had "perfectly well carried out" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have been increasing since this summer, seems to be in between parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, said Mr Camus.
UDF Association Raises Tongue and Sums New Centre to Stop Using Its Signage
The UDF association, controlled by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou’s MoDem, reacted Friday to the OPA attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the label of the former Giscardian party, while insisting that it should no longer be used on any support, under the penalty of judicial prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF seal, ruling that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after stretching his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defense, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to the NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand for being the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the office of the UDF association, controlled by the friends of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou who do not intend to resign, came out of his silence to launch a settlement to the minister and MP, adding that they no longer use the seal and to pass on the property of the pecuniary to them.
In recent days, you have multiplied the statements indicating that you were going to propose to your political movement the UDF sign, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean-Accent Arthuis.
You also thought it was good to follow on your militant material and on the guard page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the slogan + Today's UDF+, also note the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you do not have any right to use this term, explains the UDF office which continues the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any support as well as from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to pass on the ownership of (the) mark to its legitimate rightholders".
If you did not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
The New Centre therefore, according to them, has no right to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy) sign.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he filed the trademark", he was "more a member of the UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
He is scandalously and fraudulently taking advantage of the absence of the UDF acronym to do so on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironizing on the NC's strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for itself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre on Friday decided to judge the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses him, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian for the spoiler of part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This decision means that there will well be a trial in this case worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, 87, should be conducted collegially by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors designated Friday will have to submit a report before March 10, 2010 stating, among other things, whether Liliane Bettencourt has been in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she'll submit to it.
I'll talk to him about it," Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman, said at the hearing.
For his part, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is great news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) has manipulated this old lady that we have to protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed criminal proceedings against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, photographer and artist-at-all, who she accuses of having taken advantage of for years of her mother’s weakness to obtain a billion euros worth of donations.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
While the court had to consider the admissibility of the action initiated by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleas sometimes turned to the large family package on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said to be suspicious of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
“Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise, I have never been able to speak to him since his marriage.”
For its part, the Nanterre prosecutor's office again considered that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a guardian judge in recent days refused to grant her request to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in court, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in its place," said public ministry representative Marie-Chrsitine Daubigny.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial has taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
A managerial revolution or an end to economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of major French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees, recalls the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about getting employees to adhere to defined "values" from above, as it used to be, to impose products on consumers.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has handed over the strategies to conquer the markets to the spot... although the authoritarian temptation to impose disconnected products from customer preference factors is coming back on a regular basis!
Demobilization of employees can result in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives in particular.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires from employees a commitment that authoritarian management revenues are totally contrary to.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would be to put employees at the heart of the company’s concerns as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – incite this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally succeeds, after many detours, to do priority... what she has always done!
- Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the big engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old behaviourist theory, recently reactivated by the U.S. "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, to their knowledge, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "leverages" (sic) of the commitment of the executives, a recent survey of Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr strengthens leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilisation factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises involves adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a way to realize part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only studies from the Motivational Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, business leaders can control, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resources management "in place".
They thus create a conducive terrain for concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: 'just war' is worth praise right to Obama
The U.S. right on Friday hailed the speech delivered in Oslo yesterday by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of "just war" against U.S. enemies.
The Conservatives, who had broached the award to Mr. Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, said Mrs. Palin, egregious from the Republican Party’s right wing, to the USA Today daily, adding that she herself addressed the theme of the “sometimes necessary” war in her memoirs that have just been published.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists all over the place, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
On some sides, I found this all-in-one historical speech, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former candidate, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind Nobel Committee members "that they would not be free and could not award a peace prize if the use of force did not take place".
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush converted chronicler to the Washington Post, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they are not doing much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few on the right to be unconvinced, a hawk of the Bush era, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "thorny, amply and without inspiration" on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When we embrace war in the notion of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained laudable in the place of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo’s speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California daily said in a statement.
Obama “spoke the speech he needed,” the New York Times said, judging him “both dark and edificing.”
Routers: three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the road sector unions and TLF, the only employers' organization to have stayed until the end, reached an agreement Friday night that ends the strike order and the heavy threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" this agreement, after several negotiation sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the text of the agreement quickly at the end of the morning.
And this even if three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had knocked on the door.
But it took more than six hours for a meeting to begin at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "it was to be feared that it would disrupt the end-of-year celebrations," Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low-wage workers, "you go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It’s not a big deal, but we’re going a long way,” explains Patrice Clos (FO).
Either way, we're going to give orders to our activists that there are no blockades, no blockades of food centers.
But we can always have some recalcitrants that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, hailed "a good deal", even though it was "difficult to concede increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) hailed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to it as "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revaluation of travel costs of 3%, and the general maintenance of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will include addressing the issue of a 13th month and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million reduction in capital expenditures" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending finance law for 2009, voted in the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote on it “in identical terms.”
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to be applied first to the companies belonging to the organization, and secondly to the entire profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible," said Mr Bussereau.
Opposition from employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a “dubbing market” as the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million “had already been promised to the sector to offset some of the carbon tax.”
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate urgently, not at the conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to contradict the turkey eaters of the next awakening, deplored UNOstra.
For the Other, the agreement risks "to dig the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disruptions this weekend, dissatisfaction with RATP proposals
The disruptions to RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day of strike between unions and RATP management left them hungry for their demand for premiums.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10h00 and 20h00, due to a train on two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and a train on four outside the central section.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing travellers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which waits for 200,000 customers every day, was delighted that "RATP is making efforts to serve the big stores".
The RER A crosses from west to east is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran at peak times, and almost no copper in hours of cruising, as expected.
Like Thursday, there was no cohue on the quays, the French being organized.
Thus in the early morning the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequent than usual, especially due to the absence of college and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he got up "an hour and 30 hours earlier, to be sure to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare railway station did not have any saturation, the SNCF said, which had planned a mentoring of officers and law enforcement agencies.
The RER A operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left Saint-Lazare station to reach the metros.
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, judged “maigre” by the unions, of a meeting with the leadership Friday afternoon.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, which demands a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even put its premium proposals in parentheses, angered the CGT, noting that the management "was not fixated on solving a problem while for road users and SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader review of the working conditions of the profession," RATP said.
This also made the unions say that the company “was laughing at weekend users.”
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at its headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the leadership, which until then had refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in the interest of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B on Tuesday, following the filing of a warning by Unsa and Independents.
Trade unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line to a million daily travelers.
The drivers of RER, all in the second part of the career, touch from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for deferred times, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision may complicate the government’s task, which has just given the Kurdish community a hand in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "home of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Court President Hasim Kilic told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision was made unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kilic said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity benefiting Mr. T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's assets.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabeled parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, says it has "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court’s ruling comes as the government has just extended its hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to tarnish Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where many demonstrations against PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan’s detention conditions have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as the announcement of justice, a thousand protesters gathered outside the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large south-eastern city mostly populated by Kurds.
Order forces fired tear-gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw molotov cocktails or stones, with frogs.
A hundred people also showed up in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. T<0xC3><0xBC>rk said that the Court’s decision would “deepen despair.”
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, ndlr) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closing of the parties.
This does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can, of course, expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow may fall.
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the head of the Road Sweeping and Sandblasting Service (FES) said it was not to bother citizens.
This is simply so that agents can test the technique of vehicles and learn to master them well.
And according to meteorologists, this could well be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to tackle snow and ice.
The ESF follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, large sandblasting vehicles travel 20 main routes (called A routes).
This includes the busy streets, the main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and on-path streets such as the Atzelbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
ESF agents begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 km of track must be salted with a well-adhesive road fondant, in 3 hours maximum time.
That’s why the ESF service starts at 3 a.m. “so that roads are cleared when daily migration traffic starts.”
There or it gets harder, it's when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, the head of the road clearing and sanding service tells us "because no motorist is willing to let dirty vehicles pass."
Then, if it no longer snows, we take care of access roads and service roads - like the Rat-Beil-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
The secondary roads and the side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger knows that this always causes some complaints.
At five o’clock in the morning, the ESF’s pedestrian team set out to prioritize dangerous areas and crossings.
As for bicycle lanes, ESF services generally cannot deal with this.
Mr. Brauburger said there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the condition of the bridges between 22h and 4:30.
As the verglas form very quickly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
It also happens that the police are calling for this special service.
The Birth of Dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae was similar to other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long by 1.50 meters high, its posterior limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with claws in a screw and he had a lobe.
Had this species lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as reported by Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues in Science magazine Thursday, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to feature these morphological features.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the emerging land of the supercontinent, the Pangaea, and was towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa illuminates a new day the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the kinship links, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other palaeontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the research team tells that sometimes they manage to find a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
The scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations have updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories concerning the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named it Tawa after the Hopi Indians for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a completely exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he points out that it confirms certain theories regarding the early evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the first dinosaurs.
The experts ask, among other things, at what time the saurians divided themselves into three major groups of evolution: theropods (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaurus and the velociraptor that appeared later and from which descend the birds, the sauropods, the quadrupeds in the long neck, and those that are related to the orchi and herbi.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species presents an interesting report of features both primitive and developed, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found clues that suggest that the Tawa hallae had small air sacs in its bones at the level of the skull, as well as birds that are descendants of theropods.
These small pockets of air facilitate the breathing of birds compared to mammals.
It seems that at the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air sacs in its bones.
As the apparent line of the immense sauropods also possessed airbags and a light skeleton, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three major lines of evolution split and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is, all the emerging lands that formed the Pangaea supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to him.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated, the researchers say.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of the journal Science Studies said there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
Of course, there are some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a palaeontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the Silesian, that lived in present-day Poland and that belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give the wrong vision because in South America there are a large number of dinosaur fossils that have been preserved while virtually none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how the dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era, as they derived a relatively rare collateral line from the reptile branch, remains a mystery to this day.
At the time of the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of present-day crocodiles and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Trias, dinosaurs spread throughout the planet, thus promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There could have been a massive extinction at which dinosaurs survived in a random way while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or else, the dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate competition in the field.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favoured the development of a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic and had since grown in the shadows: these were mammals.
The solidarity of Vienna in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are those of course supervisors from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police of the J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt makes waves all over the world.
278 professors and teachers at J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the Protestant students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they condemn the intervention of the police claimed by the university's steering committee.
Last week, University President Werner M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Estler had the buildings occupied by students and teachers evacuated in strikes after walls and artworks were barbed with graffiti.
Five of the students were injured in the evacuation.
The signatories argue that the degradations did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police command against the students and teachers who had organized their own courses".
Evacuation represents an "unacceptable achievement" of freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to “delegitimize and criminalize protest” and tries to make the reasons for mobilization forget.
The University's Steering Committee thus abstained from discussions that would still be necessary.
The course supervisors require that the criminal prosecutions committed be immediately suspended.
The majority of the population did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimation of protests
The youth of the Verdi trade union in the services sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are only a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, said Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary for the Verdi trade union.
As for the Minister of Land Sciences of Hesse Eva K<0xC3><0xBC>hne-H<0xC3><0xB6>rmann (CDU), she took action and caused the action committed by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday during the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests, but we do not accept vandalism, said the CDU Member of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The SPD opposition parliamentary groups, the Greens and the Left (the Left) did not share this view.
CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke)
Instead of thinking about the students’ arguments and demands, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has tabled a motion that calls on the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions for police intervention.
The “Silicon Valley”
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a secret army research site under strict surveillance.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has a reputation as the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
Important places of production and research in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
As of September 2008, Zelenograd’s representatives have established links with Riedberg, the site of the Frankfurt sciences – with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a "Protocol of close collaboration".
The signatories were Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will travel to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Changes in science
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
as well as economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the Russian market in full expansion.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
It is home to the Institute of Electrical Engineering in Moscow, the major firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which the research centers are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The scope of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be set high enough.
For his supporters, this is nothing less than the “new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, into a desperate chaos of construction for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born in the spirit of the 80s.
The linehead stations, with roads ending in the city, had a reputation at the time of being the relics of the 19th century transport technique that made the effect of the brake shoe of modern rail traffic because it used to take a lot of time to pass the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what needs to be done.
That is why the main train stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a train station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Railway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 80s have long since been compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, the linehead stations no longer really pose entry and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with motorways and car-pilot at both ends.
However, we are now launching the realization of Stuttgart 21 next to the new route of the inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and local policies have taken it away.
The railway company is part of it because it is the taxpayer who makes the cost of the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the federal republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
You get an urban space that – if you believe the graphics of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The station crossing and section widening are designed for a traffic of people to which they were attributed - and this is typical of the 80s - a huge growth.
At the time, there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than trucking on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion will be absorbed into the Souabe project.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is for sure, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of junction and entanglement in the network.
The Ministry of Transport's list mentions sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the widening of the section through the Rhine valley of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been slowly built.
It would be really urgent to put a lot of pressure on the fungus here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking shoe.
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the strait of international goods traffic, and this is in the heart of Europe.
The Government examines the judgment given regarding the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government referred to the possibility of appeal to the Hesse Administrative Court's judgment on the prohibition of night air flights.
Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had instructed experts to consider from a legal point of view the judgment rendered by the Administrative Court and which is a document comprising more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the event or the project of construction of the north-west runway at Frankfurt Airport would be realized.
The authorization to land 17 aircraft between 23h and 5h in the morning, as envisaged by the Government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nocturnal air pollution.
The coalition must have decided for January 4 if it wants to appeal in cassation against the judgment rendered.
The opposition criticises this deadline and attempts to pressure the government representative to refer him to the appeal before the Federal Administrative Tribunal in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections and which was to prohibit night flights. Otherwise, this will be attributed as a total failure to a given word.
It’s damn hard to be allowed to keep his word, Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP’s electoral slogan “We keep our promises”.
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel's accusations that the country's government is still trying to authorize night flights using "lawyers and robberies".
It takes time for a specific legal review to take place.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a “fast first impression”.
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan M<0xC3><0xBC>ller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition regarding the statements of its faction on the prohibition of night flights is completely erroneous.
U.S. Banks Reimbursement of Alleged Aid
Large U.S. banks, greatly affected by the crisis, are debunking their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid $45 billion (over <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion) to the Treasury, corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp bailout plan.
The U.S. television channel CNBC said in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
The banking institutions are thus seeking to get rid of the imposed restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of the amounts, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers, as well as the settlement of higher fees.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors that reported him $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank's cash registers which are well filled by the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the Director General of the Bank of America, said he would like to thank American taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by purchasing investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup is also considering making money in the financial markets in order to get rid of the government’s guardianship.
The U.S. bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase as of Thursday, CNBC reported citing the banking media.
Citigroup’s spokesperson did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
In the end, it all happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the liquidation of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German chain ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the nomination.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin editorial board of ZDF, was the big favorite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there has also been a willingness not to further harm the ZDF's Chief Executive Officer Markus Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission out of 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender’s contract by five years, but this had been rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had voted in favour of Brender's re-election and 7 others had voted against it, and Brender's dismissal by vote was a cautious but predictable failure for Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority member of the Board of Directors, had already let it be heard several weeks before the vote, did not want Brender to be re-elected.
It was Roland Koch, the Prime Minister of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly regarded editor-in-chief by invoking the fact that the ZDF's information broadcast listening rate had decreased under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, skewing the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end, there were even 35 public law experts who had meddled in the debate and who felt that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it wouldn't have served anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the S<0xC3><0xBC>dwestfunk (Rh<0xC3><0xB6>nanie-Palatinate radio organ) and at the Frankfurter Rundschau (German national daily).
In 1983 he became an editor in the ZDF first of all in the news magazine "today-journal" (today's newspaper).
From 1988 to 1990 he was deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bimonthly information broadcast presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the service
After Brender's disgrace, while Brender had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazine, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that L<0xC3><0xA4>nder should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty of the ZDF so that the Intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political figures from the ZDF supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, Brender’s likely successor, had skillfully maneuvered with the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to oust Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter was able to propose him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as well as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a left-wing liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder decide to show themselves more conciliatory: during a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Conference of Rectors, an agreement was reached stipulating that the conditions of work were
In the future, students should be able to come to the end of their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of the examinations: a single examination must allow the completion of the chosen study module.
In addition, the workload will have to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The L<0xC3><0xA4>nder have also committed to more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master sectors.
At the regional level, there should be no different regulation from one country to another.
Fewer Exams
Since the beginning of the student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder and the university directors have constantly at their mouths the expression in fashion: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", can be read in a thirty-page document on the future conditions of admission to the academic cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of examinations, one should be able to stop the lapses, which significantly hampered studyability.
Moreover, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
Modules, just like the background, should be carefully examined to see if you can not avoid this feeling of suffocation that you sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to latest RAID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition believes Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and scope of manoeuvre necessary to enable and promote personal initiative."
The new regulation will concern access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "re-accredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been examined.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on accreditation boards created by the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder to put pressure on the agencies so that the programmes are not too busy and the review regime is not too strict.
In some L<0xC3><0xA4>nder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
Until now, Rhineland-Palatinate is the only country that has agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutoring programsand strengthen educational guidance offices as well as examination offices and international relations service.
The L<0xC3><0xA4>nder and universities are planning a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million for this.
In early 2010, the government wished to table in Parliament an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act.
As a result, it will only be necessary to pass a single examination to complete his studies.
The organization of studies will need to be more flexible, in addition to being able to ensure the recognition of grades from other higher education institutions and access to the Master should be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the issue of conditions of study in the country.
Decisions were appreciated, but criticism was heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said he would like to see the organization of educational policy no longer take place in the future "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as concerned persons should be able to express themselves a little bit.
Future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The students' experience is very useful to us", she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder on a project with which she was working.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. He demands the right and opportunity for each graduate Bachelor to enroll in a Master’s cycle.
Andreas Keller, member of the Steering Committee of the GEW, also requests that L<0xC3><0xA4>nder assure today’s Bachelor students that there will be enough room for Master’s studies and as good study conditions as possible tomorrow.
The L<0xC3><0xA4>nder therefore need to hire more course staff.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than one footnote on Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller
It is through these words that a work by the poet Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner begins, “arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control...”, in which he deals with the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his territory.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collection in a publishing house for youth before settling in Frankfurt on the Main.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the highly coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse literature forum at the artist's house in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He did a lot of talking about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the deformed mirror of your Securitate files".
Visiblely destabilized and embarrassed, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner made a statement in which he recognized before his fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner received the German language award in 1989 jointly with some of the participants.
Enrollment trials began insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, "so someone who has not been able to resist enough security intimidation."
The poet Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and his exemplary literary demilitarizations with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abscesses and the downfall of the political system.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is, as far as we can tell from current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own security case, IM Walter played a role, literature specialist Michael Markel assures after S<0xC3><0xB6>llner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had intervened in his favor.
“He was able to pull him out of all the difficult situations at the time,” according to Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which S<0xC3><0xB6>llner made his statement and before this audience was unexpected, however, the agreement of a former dissident from his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is not in fact, not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for security spies had already written Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller in July in the newspaper Die Zeit, after reading the 914 pages of her own dossier.
It can be assumed that the victims will have made speculations and at times guessed which real names were the last to hide the loan names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike Germany, where consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process in the meantime, the attitude towards the legacy of the Security file is still very confusing.
Systematic illumination has been continuously countered and curbed in the past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler Institution was created to work on the assimilation of the archives of the Security (CNSAS) but the restitution of the files has since dragged on.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former security official from Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize award to Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, expressed himself in a very disdainful way towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she was questioned only once.
The infamy of power thought to be able to express itself here, without any genes, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many inescapable questions are associated with the S<0xC3><0xB6>llner case as this occurs so often in a context of hidden guilt.
The weighted reaction of the auditors, in S<0xC3><0xB6>llner's opinion, leaves the hope that the outcome of this chapter will be more defined by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a note at the bottom of the page.
Tumults in the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative was coming there, shot at four pins coming straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross went up at midnight less than a quarter into a Mercedes class C, which he just called a car.
The man, whose bald skull drew attention, let himself be led into the city which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our five-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he had not drunk alcohol and he was not drunk of happiness either.
He had a nice evening, but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
'Cause that's where it's gonna start now.
The words of Switzerland that we had just hired three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final", i.e. in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success.
The “big job” is waiting for us on Sunday.
There, it is about repeating in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three expeditional goals of Marica (5.), Tr<0xC3><0xA4>sch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Draw at random
The eighth Champions League final (match go 16/17. + 23./24 February/ match return 9/10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminant function of Babbel's successor was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not only moderated by the lucky one, who had passed on to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I’ve been to see the players and told them that they should focus on their assets, I’ve advised them to be braver, explained the “plumber of souls” – Gross – the recipe for success that sounded so well that it no longer had any effects with Dr. Babbel.
He triggered a certain magic, Jens Lehmann, a Babbel supporter, admitted, “in football when there is a new impulse it sometimes happens things that we would never have thought possible.”
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the “phenomenon” found by a proverbial “fresh wind” and the new boss’s method of work: “It’s someone who goes into action and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet crossed the line, warned manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart especially needs tenacity.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager are keen to overestimate the victory against a completely over-defensive and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had a bad wake four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others who were still far away.
We haven’t gone through the difficult phase yet.
That Heldt didn’t have the heart to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first home win in three months, is one of the events of the weekend that a TV interview with goaltender Jens Lehmann bounced just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make, not Jens, would contradict Heldt, in response to Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had accused the leadership of style weakness and said that she had decided to change coach under pressure from pubertal fans.
Lehmann had also judged it as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the matches had been removed from him.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness" engfond Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They no longer risked becoming friends for life with these two quadrangles.
In any cast, they agreed on everything else, that is, without the group's prior work by the replaced coach, strong sports and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “for the most part in success” returned Heldt and Lehmann to the chorus – and even the man in the plastic bag acquies<0xC3><0xA7>a.
Category: World Heavyweight Championship
Warm combat in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly verbally and gesturally provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his world heavyweight title according to the version of the WBC federation.
At the unanimous consent of the judges, he imposed himself on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his world heavyweight title.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a point-to-point victory at the judges' unanimity against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time, Klitschko has proudly defended his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, Ukraine had already won twice the world championships of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed in the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, 39-time winner in 41 professional fights, has to confess twice his defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson has to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Arena of Bern, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight, from its height of 2.02 meters, by its opposite left.
Johnson, 11 centimetres smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the beatings of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko from getting his dangerous opponent into the game.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows only very rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having surpassed the distance of the twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insults Klitschko for treating him as a "villain zombie" who "is not really capable".
During Friday’s weigh-in, the champion couldn’t help but provoke Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose “so he could see his eyes.”
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko has been back in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered his WBC belt which he had previously abandoned without a fight.
This year, defending his champion title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
“I just took a hit in this fight and I’m in perfect shape,” Klitschko said, explaining his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it was British David Haye who, having given up the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was due to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotion company is considering now playing this match at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the Greens parliamentary group, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin, accused Defence Minister Guttenberg of lying in the Kunduz case.
The SPD parties and the Left (the Left) ask the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz air attack, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a falsehood" on the murderous strike of two tanker trucks last September, said the head of the Greens parliamentary group, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin, on Saturday during the ARD chain's "Tagesschau" (the 20h newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given in full disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is essentially the content of the NATO report, which was read by Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media reports, the goal of the strike was actually not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people had been killed or injured in the U.S. airstrike that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak in front of the Federal Parliament as soon as possible and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin and his Green Party colleague Renate K<0xC3><0xBC>nast are of the opinion that Ms. Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan federal government policy if the Chancellery, the Army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government's spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancellery has in no way influenced the military’s interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were rising to voice doubts about the real reasons for the resignation of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as was presented by the ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they provided to Guttenberg regarding the tanker attack was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some disturbing details from the Minister.
However, the two senior officials were told that they had informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein and a report from the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had asked in a mail for clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer.
On Saturday, the Department declined to comment on these allegations and referred to the Federal Parliament's commission of inquiry, which was due to take place the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The worlds of the dream
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in mental patients, or under the effect of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest themselves during sleep, everything is going very well.
When we lie in our darkened rooms, we can give ourselves unhindered to the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, one who, when awake, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being mad or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in mental patients or under the effect of the drug.
It is our imagination that is in question: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but which sometimes incites the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even though the trigger and the effect are distinct, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when balance, neurotransmitters in the brain - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - breaks down and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts often occur during schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of attraction on earth no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, illusions, and delusions that
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T turns into a cartoon character.
Her body is in two dimensions with criar colors.
The Earth attraction no longer has power over him, he plans to raze the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him are winged, grimacing devil creatures, the bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They pursue him, give him kicks with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over the body.
Tongue voices, bad, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo chain, actually making a loop and attaching it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around his neck.
He jumps.
The loop is detached.
Let it be a lesson for you, scream the voices in a chorus to take off his tympanum. "Go to a clinic and get yourself treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
Diagnosis: schizophrenic psychosis, paranoid, in addition he is manic-depressive, he takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During the psychosis, I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their life from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenic crisis, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitement, which causes them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relationship madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer make the distinction between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Just like the dream, psychosis opens the doors to a tide of ideas and fantasies emanating from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry at the Heidelberg University Hospital (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universit<0xC3><0xA4>tsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is at the heart of the situation, with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the ability to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience it once in your life with a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, “the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved.”
Thoughts and delusions are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real setting.
Why our brain does this kind of cabriolet is still a puzzle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to temporarily lose their perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
The researchers hypothesize that the people involved present with tiny brain lesions.
Neuronal maturation of the brain is thought to be disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is the way in which the abnormality of the neuronal system occurs and also the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains are warm.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of L<0xC3><0xBC>beck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
For the past ten years, Kasten has been compiling reports on hallucinations and the phenomena of illusory images: last year he published his results in a book entitled “The Unreal World in Our Head”.
Hallucinations are part of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychoses but also of an impressive number of many other pathologies.
Among them are mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, plaque sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising to see that under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain is warm but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like a brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimuli, stress, tears of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants admitted to having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lifetime.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania and goes to high school.
A young girl to do everything normal to really say.
If there were no images and voices.
During the recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long chested hair, speaks to him.
When she answers her friends, they look at her, surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy young girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K does not dream, she is sure.
She wakes up, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even feel her presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young sympathetic.
Are you crazy? she asks sometimes.
But she knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they are going to disappear again.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
The visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to follow the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is obviously explaining equations in the table.
At night the apparitions are generally frightening.
When, in the dark of her room, she waits for sleep that arrives too rarely and too late, she can often not make the distinction if she is already awake or dreaming, if the images she sees, the grinning faces or the young girl with bloody indentations on her arms or legs lie down or her cheeks are swollen.
Leave me alone, she screams at these creatures.
She doesn't talk to her parents or her friends, they'd take her for a madman.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She got her kiss last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact online with psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the likelihood is that they will have hallucinations after a certain time.
I'm guessing the brain isn't busy enough, so there's animation.
Sarah K., the only daughter, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called Dad, since she was old enough to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten "is taking place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychoses.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that ghosts are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one step between the dream and hallucination.
Unfortunately, in our world too focused on consciousness, we tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but it also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid form of experience, a particular form of the change of consciousness awakened by the dream.
Oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The oniroid state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is detached from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a world change takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, a capacity of organization that is given to us, to us men, so as not to fade into the abyss of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
Zurich’s Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book “Changing the Heart” as an act of saving the soul.
He is 49 years old, at the time of his conscious departure for a several-day trip after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created from every room, visits foreign places, travels through time. He sees himself as an old man in a railway sanatorium, a robot with his bed watching over his health.
He lives in the middle ages among the nobles who make blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek motorcycle who takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the Alpes and encounters a Korean mafia.
It is completely absorbed into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes describing what he has experienced.
In contrast to dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intense than real life.
The intensity of this experience brings out the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, the oniroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations, and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, says psychologist Kasten, “can cause a distortion of what we call reality.”
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snow may fall.
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
Kallen’s appointment as editor-in-chief of Burda’s editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, Spiegel told the newspaper.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are determined to integrate the company, said Hubert Burda, 69, in Spiegel.
All details have been fixed in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
You will also need to see if they are capable of doing so.
It is not possible to impose their children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to deal with them.
It would destroy children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the post of President-Director-General as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he took care of the Treasury sector i.e. he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Todenh<0xC3><0xB6>fer he also took the lead in marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17, respectively, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s appointment also serves as the link for the next 10 or 15 years.”
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families that have let themselves be driven by a bulimia of capital, which have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
This has never been my strategy.
“I never dreamed of universal power,” Burda said.
I absolutely do not see myself in the role of the country's head coach as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on much too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the objective that seems to have set itself El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the commercial center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, is home to prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its cos
There is also a food ray, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different varieties.
Spaxion offers you among other things to enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours in order to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a jacuzzi session, a massage while having a drink.
In total, there are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual “trainers” that guide customers’ steps, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (heating and stretching included), is enough to make all the muscles of the body work.
And, if after having worked our body, we want to go through the hair salon, the sign Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer hair repair rituals, lightness or nutrition, all customized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the order words of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Various décolletés
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona have an electric car
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Hall, has created the “Live Office”.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "Live Office" (Logistics for the Implantation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will implement mobility agreements, by implementing procedures, coordinating, and presenting grants,
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transportation of the future.
3 “Electric Cities”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the electric car.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
The aim is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
Among the latter are activities related to energy, and in particular to energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative that Endesa is involved in in promoting the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a set of complementary projects such as the G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT GREEN.
Zapatero announces “a future of peace” for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, sees “a future of peace” for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
At the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the Executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would now have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production sites,” said the President of the Government.
“With this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of peace for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), devoted <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 million to the projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilised an investment of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended for both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government measures to support demand, allusion to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by "40 %" in November.
20 000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Car Collection Exhibition, a meeting space for professionals and enthusiasts of the motor world.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabell<0xC3><0xB3>n de Cristal de la Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only will you be able to find motorcycles and collection cars, but you will also find items of all kinds related to the engine world at ClassicAuto Madrid.
Thus, at the exhibitors of the pavilion, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the collection engine that will make collectors and curious happy.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos de Mos and Good Old Times, automotive sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restoration, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration, or Cochera Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos, Mercedes Benz specialist.
Outdoor aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sporting exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Fitness tests with cars and collectible motorcycles will also take place on a circuit arranged outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sports spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, called i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150 horse gasoline engine 2.0.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good rating it got as a whole.
Details, vehicle finish, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver’s seat, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the dashboard and console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, that of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough housing to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, there is a large box with regular shapes.
The engine’s automatic stop and start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-litre and 150-horsepower petrol engine and with manual six-speed changes.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its fineness, low noise, performance and control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most demanded Mazda3s are the diesel models, those who do not do a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its great speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, that is, the one that has the largest number of standard elements.
Among the standard equipments, the track change assistant (RVM) which removes the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive interior mirror, the onboard computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, the self-contained air conditioner and the blu-lime, the blu-lime
In addition, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes, among other things, elements of the bi-xenon adaptable headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusions
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of the materials used, by its behaviour and by its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not do many kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the petrol engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
The “First” of Luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have us more than ever dazzling, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark "Lady".
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at its email, without offering the possibility of only seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In fact, it is more difficult to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, which is less than half of what the iPhone’s data subscription costs, for example.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American grandfather, but he has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming all over Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately look for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) in order to be able to view their mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly enticing and it’s been a long time since it should work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I’m concerned, I would need to have done a physics thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the little characters.
The repeated calls by the European Commission to propose affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely perceptible effect.
Outside of its country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it’s always curious that it’s called Fon when it doesn’t have Wifi) offers this type of rate, means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals allowing them to make their data network more profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other research on the Internet.
No subscription and no gallery.
This is a connected device and you pay when you buy it and not every month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: a lifetime-access shopping option like Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I look at my email on my phone, thank you.
I want it simply because I believe it is a more just formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to Barack Obama’s office in the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, she has, in fact, chosen the same to accompany him in the second moment, without a doubt, the most important of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize award in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar pattern on these two occasions: in addition to their similar color, a yellow pulling towards the green with bright reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a collar.
So much so that at first glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States follows the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and chose to wear the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If it was a thick lace for the job, on the other hand, it had a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium-heel green shoes for the first time, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now raised as it was being let loose the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of young generations who want to be mothers.
This is what the study “Fécondité et career professionnel des femmes en Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a” reveals, carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their professional careers limited due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether a woman works or not and the type of employment she is employed.
Those who do not have activity outside the home, work part-time or have unstable work, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, postpone entry into life as a couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed job have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling in as a couple. This figure goes to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. “These data show that women with a stable job needed more time in their lives to get it, which brought it back to life.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences motherhood, but less the start date of common life,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that crosses the age gap between the marriage age of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who did elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average, respectively.
“Another distinction also appears among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have completed elementary schooling get married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle- or higher-level studies reverse this program and give priority to getting a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a specific minor.”
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several brand products, enthralling the universal motto “Because I am worth it”.
The protagonist of Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, joins other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if selected were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, Anatomy Lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its greatest representatives, creators and models, from yesterday and today, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, are voted Best Model of the Year.
The Ass Poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
He doesn’t do it according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the core of the created character’s Ignition.
The trip is exciting and Vincent saves neither the fears nor the lighting.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an exciting invitation to reading and rereading.
I'll leave you here for a few moments.
On Albert Camus: “In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical, impulse, the same as I felt without naming it: pleasure against the fatal fate, morals without guilt, and innocence without any god.”
On Samuel Beckett: “Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, devoid of meaning, like the blade of the knife that nearly killed him.”
On Graham Greene: “Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he conjugated the emotion of adultery to the pleasure of murder, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven by way of perdition.”
On James Joyce: "L'Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the peaks of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be engraved on the north face, on which the best climbers still let go and always taken."
William Faulkner once said, “It was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a county landowner and other times that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the demented cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he did so in the flight of himself and invoking the posteriority with a violent speech to the ass."
On Dorothy Parker: “One day she got to her knees and prayed, ‘My God, I beg you to stop writing like a woman.’
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: "Sleep after effort, / after storm carries it, / rest after war, / after life, fatigued death rejoiced."
On Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband accepted very normally that she told him that Edward VII was playing it between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent went beyond madness.”
On P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: “What did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do if he tried to hide Joyce at Baroja?
What did Benet try if he didn't shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What has this done if it is not to aspire to the glory of this man so that he may serve him as a scapegoat?”
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a blood-melt, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they hit her with a stone.
Our outrage is immense because we don’t see what’s fun to attack free of charge a small defenseless animal that, moreover, was left in the air.
One must add to this the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, managed to fear for her physical integrity, since an energetic that attacks an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man, or, more definitively, a person.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., one Tuesday like another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog groaned all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint with the district commissioner's office, even if we doubt that it serves a great deal and in order not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We don’t understand what’s happening with young people so they find it fun to treat a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We don’t know where the right education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for the port of the helmet
The tiremaker Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the port of the helmet, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as the two structures have indicated today.
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, as it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin said the campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products” and said it was contributing to this goal through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign to encourage the two-wheeled helmet port, under the motto "To be or not to be", will feature a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to guarantee the widest distribution.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, because as a tire manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employers’ union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, the concept of the companies.
However, the good news should be nuanced, since the reference to the comparison, in November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite last month's rebound, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if you add all vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from tourist cars, pickups, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95,853 have been sold.
The big clouds that affect their demand the most have not dissipated, in fact, although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small or medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in the limitation of bank loans, other factors need to be added, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In view of this situation and unlike the tourist vehicles, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E has served little.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit from it, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, Ganvam recalled the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of Dealers foresees a year 2010 similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales (of tourist vehicles and 4x4).
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory. <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
As has been the case with the ABS anti-lock system and as will be the case with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
In addition, they are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a deficiency period has been fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many back-shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in case of emergency detected by the system thanks to the foot stroke given by the driver.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the car component manufacturer Bosch, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from all of its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: one in four accidents with injured people is estimated to be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver responds, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
While the workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on the 8th –, according to Javier Ortega’s plan, the manufacturer of the north-easterica needed to
Nick Reilly, GM Europe’s new president, hears that each point of the plan has been approved by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, is confident that a decision on Saab’s sale should be made in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining importance.
In the event that there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to slim it down to just under 80 kilos, leaving the balance at just 1,275 kilos.
This led them to switch, first of all, from the automatic roof that has been replaced by a manual dredged roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the tank to 64 kilos of gauze, to reduce the tank from gauze
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, thus gaining six more kilograms and replaced the door handles with tissue handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double clutch PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on California’s secondary network roads, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behavior can only be described as irrefutable.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it has long been the case that we have not tested such a small and lightweight model which, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in the turns, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles for the necessary time, until we asked him to sprint, brake, recover and push his motor again...
That's what we wanted out of it. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands on the steering wheel will indicate.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Sound from motor at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the “sports” option or thanks to a system that modifies the engine roar, already used on the Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, whether at stoppage or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The coating of the roads we went through with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car managed the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants barely noticed presence throughout the trip, while on some turns we found glass in the early morning and engravings, later in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultra-light, funnier car to drive and which is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
" Bag Girl "
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house parades, the singer displays her face as a bad girl with as much content as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or a "It Girl", it's a "Bag Girl".
Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a landslide victory at 91-82 during his visit to the hard ground of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic's team. It is thus at the head of his group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic which, with eight of his best three-pointers, scored 29 points.
Vitoria’s team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and collective work, even though she had to wait until the end to win the victory.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 three-pointed baskets, largely determined the final victory.
The match started quickly for the blues and reds, who took the lead right from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of Vitoria's team were marked from the perimeter, it was predicted that they had jumped on the Israeli ground with the hot wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was on the same pitch, but Alava's team chose Barak's home game and Eliahu's work, which was received by cheers and applause back to his old home, to increase their break advantage (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to notice himself as the best player in his team, with 13 points, although Splitter’s “less than six” rating already lets predict that this night was not going to be the best in Brazil.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from there, and the Avala team wanted to remind Vitoria that they did not win so easily on their field, and thanks to "the hand of Elias" they managed to get into the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellows taking advantage of the bright (50-49).
Other Difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from dead, needed to chain some skillful actions to take the air, and it was at this time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerged which, with three consecutive three-point baskets and the help of English and Ribas's reconquents, reconquented the
Avala’s team went out to play the whole thing in the last period and English and San Emetrio (60-75) advised that they were not going to let anyone take what they deserved for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for fouls, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis got closer in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory was running out in Tel Aviv for the first time.
Injuries Prevent Unicaja from Delivering Battle
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against the Olympiacos and gave him the head of Group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the absence of Unicaja players, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the victory.
The Malaga team was not intimidated by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion nor by the size of the rival, perhaps one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream of an aggressive defense and three consecutive three-point basket, two from manager Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio who overshadowed the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the home game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse the score 22-20, at the twelfth minute, when an action, a disqualified start of the battle, between the leaders of the North and Williama.
The Greek team began to function by showing its superiority in both camps, while the injury exit of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
Internal players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, crossed the 44-32 advantage, at the nineteenth minute.
An impossible climb
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos who, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to equalize the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, making the group head clear.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit from the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the encounter.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left some hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was almost impossible because the Olympiacos proved implacable when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
Croatia's Nikola Vujcic managed to climb the score to 81-62, at the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would earn based on their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of small real estate, employment and vehicle ads in Spain.
The “How much should you be paid?” tool calculates user salaries from more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you need to register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city you want to work in.
For the past week, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker “feels poorly paid,” said Albert Ribera, product manager at Trovit.
Based on the data Trovit<0xC3><0xA0> has from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, the Spanish are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer earns 45,226 euros a year gross and a French one, 31,059, while a Spanish one receives 24,000 euros.
In the same way, a driver earns 34,247 gross euros annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid job in Spain is server work, with 11 592 euros net annual, followed by vendor work, with 14 725 euros, and worker work, with 15 667 euros.
The most sought after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of driver, part-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president will have to abandon the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, head of business at the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
“He is aware that he must leave on January 27th, after his term, he must seek another destination.”
The channel also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the deadline: “My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government,” Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 election (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the political exile condition that the de facto government, presided over by Roberto Micheletti, intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much
After pink days since last spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant market note, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about a future of uncertain nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize the markets was to monetize debt by buying assets directly and indirectly by giving liquidity at near-zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been practically finalized and, without jeopardising their non-compliant liquidity policy, they are starting to put some sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their allocation to one year next week.
As a result, investors have doubts about the global economy’s ability to sustain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the risk premium reduction.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the deviations from corporate obligations are increasing again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected by it.
There is once again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the shelters chosen by investors, causing an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro area and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened with a further revision to the decline in the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence moral risk advocates, who were again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those responsible for global economic policy who had curbed the destructive effects of limiting credit on the destruction of employment.
However, the situation in Dubai is similar to a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore their place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case in Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It would be completely irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member country to fail to comply with its commitments.
What is logical, on the other hand, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are facing an episode of transitional risk premium normalization, after a few excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our differences in public debt increase as the obligations of European companies are met, we do not have to worry.
If European disparities were to decrease and ours continued to increase, then this would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecasting indicators oblige most study services to anticipate their recovery models and to revise their forecasts for 2011, in addition to the OECD and the European Commission, which are back in charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it is important to look at the future.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the time being “precaution is the mother of certainty”.
Connected Sectors
Iberdrola’s president, Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, was the first to intervene yesterday, in front of the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain’s energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, outlined for the press what he had mentioned before the sub-committee, at eight-close.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion by 2020 and an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion between that date and 2030, in case the nuclear power plants would remain open today.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue is changing, and power will need to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18,000 MW is needed, with other "support energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what his company claims, did not want to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate-warming policies.
According to him, there is “a clear long-term bet” in this regard, despite the “point-of-the-point” measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any event, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that decisions to invest, although they are in the long run, must begin to be made, as they take some time before they reach maturity and that a stable remuneration framework is necessary to address them.
Ferrovial Wins Aer Lingus Handling Market at Ten Airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of a privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Centre for Smart Infrastructure Innovation.
The alliance expects an investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to carry out research on energy efficiency on highways and at airports.
Acciona disputes its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concessional motorway in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The site is an estimated $1,700 million tunnel (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometer long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, such is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works and highway concessionaire company.
The city council hopes to have it by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the auspices of Erns & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
In anticipation of the presentation of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to 1 700 million Australian dollars (about 1 047 million euros) and in the last phase three consortia face off, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in lingerie, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists of underground works.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium is built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger, public company) and the railway company.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatisations, but getting into them is a big challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the already mentioned companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just won a place in this market with its 30% stake in Leighton owner Hochtief.
Millionaire Assets
Acciona is placed on a geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the grouping of companies to build and manage the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and draw on synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Bureau and the Northern Link (northern link), is called to connect the western highway from Toowong to the suburban road to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometers of tunnel.
The schedule set by the administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, the site is not expected to be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include twice two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide 500 million Australian dollars ($308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make extensive use of Hochtief, who yesterday mentioned obtaining a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national high-speed fiber optic network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have quick access to the Internet and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company sold the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the city of Brisbane. Work has not yet begun and Hochtief has completed sales for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O’Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC is awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, for an amount of 64.5 million euros.
The company obtained this contract a few days after being charged with the expansion work of the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The construction is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore is being sued for advertising from Renfe
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that submitted themselves to the tender organised by Renfe, four of which were finalists, including TBWA who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Telecom to curb competition
The French competition regulator fined France Telecom <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and loyalty programmes to consumers outside the scope of the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still a state-owned company, has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it places on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was also increased because the competition authority considers that France Telecom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore a recidivist.
A shop of applications
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile phone subsidiary followed the footsteps of other operators and opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries like Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have won 467.4 million, placing them in the third and fifth position of the clubs that have staked the most money in this competition.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for major clubs.
In fact, the competition has allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spaniards) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third on the continent to touch the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and the last winner of the old European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that have also charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, although they lost in front of the Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country in terms of the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution (disambiguation)
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this year, Michel Platini’s organization plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the qualifying matches (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and equality (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth final receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter final receive3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a has staked 2.5 million to have won the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are devoted.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four attractive seats.
The previous year's champion pocketed 40% of the money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid based on the number of matches played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
Nueva Rumasa Group listed yesterday the details of the share purchase offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos's capital.
A percentage that does not oblige it to launch a public procurement bid (OPA) for all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5025 per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this postponement.
Yesterday, Sos’s shares ended at 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa’s offer assesses the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
Jerez Group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of securities.
The CNMV assured not to have been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If this were to happen, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos's capital is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure his management.
In an attempt to stay out of potential purchase offers and go and come to court from her former directors, brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luis Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as internal audit director.
A decision that makes it the first woman to hold a leadership position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free from controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the supposed diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that over the next few months Sos will reveal new diversions of funds cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) told the National Hearing yesterday that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes Paterina's exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the OPA to be excluded from the Federico Paterina by Inversora Mer on 9 October.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with the current standards and that it considered "sufficient" the contents of the explanatory sheet presented, following the changes applied on 2 December last.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paterina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilized and that they could not in any way be transferred before the completion of the offer, which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paterina, in accordance with the rules in force.
New tools for the expertise of cars
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex job.
To calculate by hand the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including the parts and the labor can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the help of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That’s why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service and solutions providers for the assessment of claims and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, and then process and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of assessment tools and information development in the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, Commercial Director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard work, because you have to catalog each of the thousand pieces of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, a “smart” graphic image of each model is created on which you can click on the different parts of a tourist car.
If this is a massively sold model, the work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, for example, they have information about Porsches, but not Ferraris or Lamborghinis.
In the case of vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (generally mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million annually to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer different products.
The most common application is for repair and maintenance, but depending on the countries, there are also tools for the management of breakage parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
They include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is an open server for the professional Internet sector that allows you to shop on vehicles that are declared defective.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geo-demographic analyses or knowing the common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious accidents for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to official parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for assessing claims, breakdowns or debt servicing.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased at the rate of 20% per year over the last three years, and it has made a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she began her internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its turnover is realized in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
The global turnover of the Solara Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country, the company will receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>19.1 million, or 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the stock exchange of $1 million, and today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it is on the side of the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet Auction of Accidental Cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand next year to the remaining 15%.
The goal of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimate and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, check-ins and professional sellers who need to be registered before starting operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 vendors and 4000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
In accordance with Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collectible cars can be re-recorded, although they have been removed, after complex procedures.
Four-stage garage pricing
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user gets a quote in only four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 off-roaders, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and an internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the required part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the labor, increases or reductions, and then he can print the quote to return it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalog of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one intended for garages does not include the estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be the subject of a credit.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to make these images in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and rotate it to see the inner face.
