European inflation slides into food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the dizzying rise in food prices.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, recording - after 2.6 percent of the month in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent - the Union Statistics Office in Luxembourg announced.
Official forecasts were only likely to give 3 percent — Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decline, along with rising commodity prices and the reduction of forced labour, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: “negotiations” about inflation must be negotiated so that it does not have to intervene later on.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, beat the 12-year record; while in Spain it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation shot up in the euro area as a result of the galloping food and energy prices.
Quotas at the end of wheat increased by 88 per cent, and so the soy quota reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market rose 52 percent this year, reaching nearly $100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, but by 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain in the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to double interest rates during 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stagnation, early December support for the Democratic Youth Alliance increased significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced such a low level – 13 percent – in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of secure party voters – due to the greater firmness of opposition voters – would mean more than two-thirds (71 percent) support compared to one-fifth support for socialists (20 percent).
According to the poll, the Democratic Forum and the Free Democrats Alliance would not even reach the limit needed to have any parliamentary seats: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the secure voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the lowest point before – it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged especially bad the economic situation of the country, while another 46 percent believe the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as next year is concerned, the majority of the population has the deterioration of the situation and only one-tenth of the population expects improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of those polled, higher than any previous Gallup poll, estimated that the President of the Government would rather miscarry than do his duties well.
13 percent of the respondents trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny a lot, while Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n has the support of 38 percent of the respondents.
54 percent of the population does not trust the head of government at all and 27 percent do not trust the president of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control experienced discontent with the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year, 35 percent thought it would be desirable to keep the government and the head of government in power, currently this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believes that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the participation question answered that they would certainly participate and another 20 percent said that they were likely to participate.
By comparison, in "general elections to be held this Sunday" only 55 percent of the population would certainly participate and another 15 percent believe likely their participation. Based on the current intentions of voters there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
74 per cent of the population would disapprove of payment of tuition fees, 79 per cent of medical consultation services and 84 per cent of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of study rights, the payment for medical consultations, and that of hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has five times its prices
The average price level increase of 16 percent was maintained by the hypermarkets of the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs gold trading triangle, with the difference that this year the VAT has not been increased.
Article of Daily Economy
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs gold trading triangle the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth much higher than the thousand HUF.
As prices had already “fired” in food supermarkets in December last year, so did not experience a drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below the 9,000 HUF, today they can’t do it for even ten thousand.
Napi’s basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the basket with the highest value was 10,573 HUF.
(In 2003 that basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and maple seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed data from the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was equally surprising at this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with a two-liter redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan’s basket was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, regarding last year’s Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan by about 18 percent the prices listed in Napi’s basket.
Comparing last year’s most expensive basket values with this year’s cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while last year’s cheapest and most expensive basket values have been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year’s average price growth was HUF 1206, so during last year’s Christmas prices felt the increase in VAT.
It was this process that destroyed the trade, the supermarkets were visibly unable to make a decision on the price margin to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of the price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of a product’s circulation, he may lose a significant profit in the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF to the value recorded in 2006, while at the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, as the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased by 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets more than 30 percent the price of essential consumer goods grew.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some essential foods, recorded a price increase of more than 30 percent over the 12-month period.
So for example, in addition to the wheat, also in the case of the egg.)
According to Napi’s basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product which was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case only 10 percent price increase.
According to all the indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, being able to impose the drastic price increase even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the gold trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experience, most consumers of the three stores visited no longer care about prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking with them the food preserved by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, the three stores formed large queues in front of the boxes because it suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that inside the country the sales volumes are lower, numerous multinationals complain to the survey institutes because the revenues are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
Several thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals this year, primarily due to the misuse of antibiotics.
The prevailing hygiene conditions in hospitals, bed-wetting and staff overload do not favor infection control, says the head of the department of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of Hospital J<0xC3><0xA1>nos.
In a hospitalized man after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
One injured in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient soon afterwards had to return to the hospital as a result of MRSA infection and since then no major surgery has been possible due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
As of December 10, 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multidrug-resistant agents have been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, head of the department of the National Epidemiology Center.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections produced by multidrug-resistant agents has certainly been recorded, the rest is not known.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One-third of humans carry the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (SA) in their nose without causing any disease.
Infections produced by SA (e.g., throat inflammation, amygdalitis, skin infections, wound infections) respond well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once overly or improperly applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics are transformed into bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotics and quickly become infected under inappropriate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as infections of wounds or septicemia in the first place to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with the weakened organism, elderly or people of low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of Hospital J<0xC3><0xA1>nos there is nothing special in MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to Antibiotics
“These patients are isolated, nursing staff take care of them in rubber gloves and mask and there are antibiotics suitable for their treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are pre-tested to check for MRSA in their body, but even so, infection cannot be avoided in all cases.
It is not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA hospital infections in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of formation and infection with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
As this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients who carry MRSA in their body.
However, in Hungarian hospitals it is not fashionable to take microbiological samples.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient, said the head of the department of the epidemiology center.
The European Union makes strict recommendations for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological conditions.
Antibiotic therapy should be directed, i.e., microbiological tests should be performed to prevent resistance to drugs, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent in the case of outpatients or in basic care - said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
It is saved with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through health care staff.
Therefore, hand washing plays a very important role, the use of rubber gloves and masks, however also in this sense considerable shortcomings are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is infected by droplet transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least a distance of 1.5 meters.
Regrettably, it can also be experienced - Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz added - that in less favorable economic-situated hospitals is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater likelihood of infection.
In the opinion of Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, where appropriate prevention measures are met, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the pathogen infection can be stopped.
Government Program against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Sickness Insurance Fund, so in all countries it fights against it.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The program appears to be successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multidrug-resistant agents (including MRSA) and that of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative control of alcoholism of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The expert official report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the district police commander XXII has been made.
The possibility that he was driving drunk or in a shaky state can be ruled out by the then retired district police commander XXII, who on Tuesday called and caused the death of a passerby - reported Friday Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, after the case had prepared the report on the periphery.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary control of alcoholemia that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcohol before putting himself behind the wheel.
The then head of the district police station XXII, on Tuesday with his private vehicle folding into the street Kossuth Lajos of district XXII, ran into a 55-year-old man who intended to cross the street, but not in the designated pedestrian area.
(The latter fact, i.e., that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Transit Code are not attenuating circumstances, the driver must always give up the step by folding.)
The passerby lost his life after being hospitalized.
The district police chief resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The investigation of the case is carried out by the Budapest Investigation Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements in Budapest on Friday for a total value of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million to finance education, transport and the environment infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget transport and environmental protection projects, which will be carried out from the grant of cohesion funds, of which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million, the contract will be used to repay the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million credit agreement is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for this Hungary objective, on the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million the decision will be taken later, by extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million contract for innovations, which the budget will mainly employ for the University of Debrecen’s innovation and research project.
During the talks they also covered the topic of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
The agreement was reached that by the time Hungary finalizes the details of the financing of the Metro with the EU, they will re-address the issue that if necessary or not to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
The interest on the credits is adjusted to EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charge for maintaining the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is admirable – the attention of all of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country previously mentioned.
What, where, and who buys in the EU’s even cheaper market, will quickly get tougher?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred objective for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is without a doubt some Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments on the ski slopes and the chalets on the beaches.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the beaches of Albena, the "Golden Coast", the "Costa del Sol", the former Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
In the same way, the capital Sofia can be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, thus being a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria, also strive to change their lives and their way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Also present are Maltese and Cypriot promoters and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in the ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups – says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, besides for them it is important the proximity of a big city, the shops and generally a local doctor.
The second category consists of the buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included among the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group consists of real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of real estate is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they have experienced an annual increase of 21 percent.
The increase in the price of real estate significantly exceeds the growth of wages.
Fodor and the six hundred Hungarians
According to Minister of Environment and Hydrology G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, the expert-level meetings will end on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening will continue the minister-level negotiations on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world are debating the Bali Roadmap, which provides for the post-Emissions Reduction Period, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
There are currently lively discussions on the particular between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not currently want to negotiate on precise figures, although it tends to agree that compared to the situation in 1990, by 2020 emissions responsible for the greenhouse effect decreased by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major topic of the conference is whether industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing or unwilling to offer material and technological assistance to countries in need.
A further agreement was reached on the assistance to be provided to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be headed by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Piac es Profit".
The six hundredths of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Hydrology G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 level, regardless of whether or not the “agreement after 2012” will be signed and is willing to commit to reducing even 30 percent if the other major developed regions of the world and their developing countries are also in line with their commitments.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol pledged to decrease by 5.2 per cent, within this the then 15 EU member states committed to meet an 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce by 6% the greenhouse gas emissions from the 1985-87 period, which our country will meet," the Ministry of the Environment said in a statement.
It is very much at stake in Bali, since in two years it will have to sign the international agreement on long-term climate policy, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed by after 2012. In this case the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol, would not be immediately followed by a new international system of reduction of emigrants,
With this, the reduction of emissions would be delayed and an increase of more than 2<0xC2><0xB0>C of the Earth’s average temperature could not be prevented, according to scientists, which would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British Army recruits on YouTube
Units of the British army in a video distributor publish footage of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube’s services: Special Forces deployed in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos about their actions against the Taliban.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in the general body of Kandahar operations, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
There are already 139 recordings from the air force soldiers that have been uploaded in this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of actions carried out in both Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the air force had uploaded the videos with recruitment objectives, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defense they also serve to present to the public the true objective of the British army's presence abroad.
This type of propaganda almost costs nothing compared to conventional television spots of recruitment – said defense expert Gordon Mackenzie – instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans have made a video game.
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the meticulously edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear on the distributor, for example about the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers speak as a maximum of losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fighters.
In addition, from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos have already been uploaded to the Internet recorded in real operations, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different way to recruit with the free downloadable shooting video games called America’s Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly instead of the soldiers.
T<0xC3><0xB3>mbola y pastelillo salada at the Christmas party of the ministries
Labour minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth doesn’t seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye in 2007 with salad cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate their party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with a tombol and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so enjoy the power.
The state offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for Ministry workers.
At Christmas of the Orphans will receive gifts from the children of the fallen soldiers and for Christmas of the Missionaries the relatives of the soldiers who currently perform missions abroad will be invited. Also a reception will be offered for the press.
This portfolio will allocate $25 million for the festive atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held at the Casa del Futuro, with a total budget of HUF 4,320 000 and the ministry’s six hundred workers are expected to be present at approximately three hundred and fifty.
At the festival of the portfolio will reign an atmosphere of Christmas, artists will also act and there will be a tombola draw.
The ANF’s Christmas cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that the workers of one of the departments of the ANF are also invited to another Christmas party that will celebrate a contest management company called the Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Teatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we have not been able to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF party, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of Lucia’s day on December 7.
The CNAJ did not charge them anything for the use of their facilities.
Fifty people participated in the dance.
The party began with the greeting words of the minister and after dinner there was live danceable music.
Responding to the question of [origin] they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear a dress or evening dress.
Health, work and local government portfolios are being prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
Instead, Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year work meeting.
It has the participation of one hundred and eighty guests who – as the press department reports – will take only coffee and salad pastel, so the party will not cost more than 350,000 HUF.
The minister for local governments, Gordon Bajnai, will instead simply provide with his colleagues in the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Development classroom.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will celebrate a Christmas party in its own hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget will be paid the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres is the minister, MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
Instead, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the schedule of the afternoon of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year’s reception on January 20, the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple reception stand, which will be invited only to specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting speech from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not hold any Christmas parties - this is what the corresponding press departments told [origin].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio, they were unable to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the festival that will be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are coming together.
The League Trade Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions will form a strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday’s strike that will last indefinitely.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday – the day the final public health law vote will be held – work will begin.
Certainly this action will cause great difficulties in transport, since the railway traffic will be stopped completely and until 13 o'clock the workers of the Budapest Public Transport Company will also be on strike.
On the afternoon of Friday, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike that will be held jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions.
The strike committee of the LIGA and the National Machinists’ Union will also be formed, which will coordinate Monday’s actions.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating unions will speak on strike indefinitely, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike.
Instead, if the law is passed, strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the National Assembly it is also possible to vote only on public health law in the very early hours of the night, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, significant difficulties in transport will have to be had: in the railways will stop working indefinitely, in the morning a part of Budapest’s public transport and more than half of the intercity bus transport of Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies may be stopped.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike for indefinite time, others for definite time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement on even the minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approached, more and more people are travelling on the trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m., the workers of the Budapest Public Transport Company, the Budapest Airports from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., will hold a four-hour strike of the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electric Industry and Energy Trade Unions of the Electric Industry and Energy Trade Unions of the 2
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will speak on national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Workers of the Health and Social Sector (SDTSSS) who are part of the Forum of Trade Union Cooperation will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation that will enter into force next year.
The third is that, even before 2010, in the case of advanced pensions, they ensure that the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Trade Unions, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the rail sidelines and expects another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk of the Hungarian Guard increases
According to the Political Capital’s Risk Analysing Division, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, from several points of view has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In the company’s “risk warning” it is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is the fact that “with the worsening ethnic tensions existing between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur”.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - the representative of the research institute added.
They claimed that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the Gypsy problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing differences between Gypsies and Gypsies."
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflict erupting.
In addition, according to the institute of research, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, “significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country”.
We are reminded that since the autumn of 2006 it has received increasing publicity and momentum for the reorganization of the radical and far-right groups of Hungary and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been established in the country that define themselves as "national self-defence associations".
“The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense – even armed – (civil defense, national defense, public order defense), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, i.e. the state.”
They stated: all this is done in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction of society with politics and political parties.
To highlight civility and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
In recent months, in many neighboring states, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures from certain neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this affects the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks were increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar way to, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the mass unrest of the Gypsies that occurred in one of the neighbourhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to constitute the guard, arguing that the organization’s goal is “national self-defense”.
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been “gypsy terror” in Bulgaria, yet the state has remained powerless and indifferent to the facts – recalls Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has sparked a lively discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Roma organizations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Gypsies of Hungary also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense – can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Political Capital Research Director Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz asked the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, they report to the public, as happened in this case, publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary, the law accurately defines the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that the next year will be less - reorganize the working days.
Not even in the EU or in North America are parties unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between a national holiday, a state holiday and a public holiday.
Festive days are mainly related to religious festivals and historical ephemerals.
Let’s celebrate the New Year as well: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive – the latter especially so that you can rest those who have spent celebrating the old year.
Throughout the year we have eleven red-numbered parties on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on 15 March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and on 23 October, a commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the State, on May 1st, the Labor Day, on November 1st and 2nd, we remind our deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, in our country are two-day holidays Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it often becomes a bridge when before or after the holiday there is a single working day.
In exchange for the extended weekends like this, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
It is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly before or after the party.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory, however, for companies and service institutions that, due to their function, work continuously even during holidays.
This year the order of work can only be changed around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24 practically life is stopped in the country, as according to experience, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our holidays will coincide with mid- or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda around the work party will be modified so that, for four consecutive days, the workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day, so that in return on Friday May 2nd will be a festive day.
The other change relates to the 23rd of October party: on Saturday 18th of October, you will have to work instead of Friday 24th.
On the other hand, the next year during the end of the year party can be rest, since from December 24 it will not be worked almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six Small Disadvantages to Hurt Your Colleagues' Lives
E-mails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing: they are all part of our daily folklore at work.
You have to decide whether you adapt to small annoyances or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Advice.
I'm sorry, I forgot to let you know that you've been sought out by the marketing department," one of your colleagues says.
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best you feel it and try to fix the issue, you better call the marketing department to tell them you forgot to deliver the message (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time the issue is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to oral explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can bitter the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more annoying than when you want to grab a document, an office tool, or your phone and you can’t find them.
Do you remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but for this morning it disappeared?
Can you find your lost pen on the table of one of your colleagues?
Do not take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be angry with you for withholding their things.
Don’t pick up envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out ahead of time.
Are you joking about your colleagues’ private lives?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don’t pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about the private life of your colleagues!
Don’t abuse your colleague’s trust when they share their most intimate secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even though others know the things about him.
Are you getting sick leave unwarranted?
When you call the office on the phone and say you are sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or good, you feel like that day you prefer to rest; think about what others must do your job, your unstoppable tasks, your job forever.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you must stay at home, communicate with them, so that your colleagues or boss do not have to face your absence the next day.
Tarareos, laughs, phone calls
Are you put into your work, but are you suddenly pulled out of it by the laughter of your colleagues?
Have you unintentionally heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to listen to it?
Don’t bother your colleagues with your tarareos, chants, loud conversations (less when you make them over your head), patalies, constant blasphemies, expressing your dissatisfaction out loud.
All of these can be annoying, although they are not currently deepening into a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don’t blame others if you haven’t finished something on time, forgotten to send an important letter or message!
Don’t allude to the chaos eventually reigning in the office, or the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must correct the mistake!
Ask how you can fix your lack!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and shoes: Very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Do not see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don’t be disorganized, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation demands it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car progresses slowly in the usual morning jam.
Sounds like a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm going up the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female chorus as a real jewel intervenes.
The channel mr2 plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national music life didn’t hurt us much with high-quality electronic pop.
But now this jam seems totally different when you’re listening to Zagar’s new album.
Some new and interesting songs from the national [b2]digital [b3] underground gradually change the image and although again it is fashionable the rock style garage, breaks guitars, the national electro pop has proved: there is novelty under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he started his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to triumph, when he was asked for film soundtracks (pl.
Ferenc Turkish Season).
The wider audience knew the ensemble that initially acted only in small clubs when the wan2 magazine selected its first album released in 2002 from among the 50 most important national albums, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trendmaker, able to sell itself also in the Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are in fashion, but no one has asked them if they wear this label or not.
The set reacted as it should react: it prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the early years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the old set of Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
The reference on the airy, on the flight, but in addition to the airy music, now appeared – according to the spirit and trend of the time – the guitar that sounds strongest, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album in the Millenary Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rgy Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the set The Puzzle.
The album includes a true success of the mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi channel that recently broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This station brought to the ears of the radio listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
Everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu questions the Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: What are you playing, to what extent is music dedicated to a select audience?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The definition of select audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally just for sale, making it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has larger traditions.
There, not only the fifteen and twenty-year-olds attend concerts, but also the oldest ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public have in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good to see more and more people attending our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is a mutual influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow Yonderboi’s example?
He works alone and made his career better to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don’t follow his path, even though sometimes they try to compare our music to that of him.
We rather work as a team, rely on each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they compare our work with the music of Yonderboi, as many of us started our career in his group and from there we took another path.
hvg.hu: In Mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi Wings of Love's hit list is in the first place.
Many people first heard Zagar's name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open up with this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn’t intend to compose great hits and sell our record with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We add it to the end of the album, trying to relax after the sound of the album and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of good-voiced soloists from our own national music scene.
This created that chorus of six women – Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC3><0xAB> Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh – who were later baptized as Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly that way or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the record, we thought something was still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
That night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It was almost the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited then, but of course I also needed the Divas.
With my voice I would not have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and on the record it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay’s short solo), they have no role of their own, they all sing together and no more strongly than music, so music doesn’t just accompany their songs.
Also on the stage they are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says about it, about which we forget for a while our ego, who from where it has come and where it goes, so let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have liked to have others feel the euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you dedicate the most work to?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually to none, rather when mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want the groove to work and then, little by little everything was put in place like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with the concerts and because I have already "released" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
It's an unfaithful villain.
This is what Jerome Kerviel, the giant French banker of Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Trade Bank, points out.
He lost about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and, without a doubt, with good abilities.
He long ago intuited, unlike all major Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel’s responses according to French media outlets, such as the newspaper Le Monde, is that it was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
The crisis not only in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he says in his responses.
Exactly, in the summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity already saw her come early in the year.
In February, they started hearing some news about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
“When I won my first $500 million I didn’t know how to notify him,” Kerviel admits, adding that nothing has been left for him at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had forged the records in such a way that his discovery would not be reached.
He even managed to trick the bosses, even as the Eurex Stock Exchange began to become interested in their businesses.
The risk has become a benefit
Were you afraid you'd find out?
No, no, no, no.
“I thought I had earned $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy.”
Where did he get so much willpower to take that risk?
In my position, I had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, just after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was between $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
I still knew I was never going to win as much as the others.
“In my first interview in 2005 I noticed that they were looking at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel told the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this was a boot mechanism, and wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
“This is like a snowball,” police said.
But it is said that the chiefs knew about all this or rather suspected it.
"As long as he was making money, his eyes were closed."
Only that, after, came the blow earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to wipe out all the prints.
When Monday came to work, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion because of it.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
“I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn’t have a vacation is a runner who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his record,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has the potential to achieve 365 billion
Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, of which the Czech Republic can achieve <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>365 billion).
This represents almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of the seven operational programmes, approximately 125 billion crowns will be issued for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain about 100 billion crowns from the Enterprise and Innovation Program.
Most of the money will go to transportation, up to $150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Business and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should get funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly arrived countries that use them least.
A 20-year sentence for the former president of Nicaragua, the court ruled
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals ruled on Thursday the 20-year sentence for the country's former president, Arnaldo Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, who was convicted in 2003 for the collapse of $100 billion (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Despite this, a time later, he was released from prison to go on house arrest in his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this time, according to the AP that, the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is again between bars.
According to the President of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, will rather depend on prison officers if they let German finish his sentence at home or if they make him go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how German was constantly transferring government money to a company’s account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Some of this money ended up in the fund that German created to fund his campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how the budget was approved.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first elaborated by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year’s budget was already approved with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not be allowed not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view, although the most influential, passed the new law quietly.
It's a big paradox.
Every government starts and ends with every chapter and budget departure, like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and that is why they pay special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State Budgets of the last Social-Democrat governments suffered from three defects that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenses of the mandaters who are not only pensions but also social benefits that were approved before last year's elections by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first deficit.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
Despite this, the greatest risk is not in the state budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
The watchmaking pump, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from taxes, fees and loans from banks, often issued, without meaning, obligations with which they disproportionately owed to their municipalities.
In recent years they managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy stocks and other development networks that they received from the state and from privatization.
They currently do not have this resource.
If we stick only to the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, a few years ago, is going through stages of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, of what is called <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to order state finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to borrow.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that it falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to nations that, within global measures, are less threatened by poverty.
That is why mass social programmes are not needed, which, unfortunately, have in recent years been unnecessarily inflated with gigantic measures.
And while they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending passed this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform do not change then it will be the real end of any policy in this country and, governing who governs it will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a bit, we can say that the politicians who govern will turn into officials, mechanical distributors of most of the retirement tax money and social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure from the normal expenses of the presidents’ expenses.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the previous government had not wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We do not want the politicians who govern to become only officials, so we must be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and fees, the tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
The Monetary Mark will receive more than $100 billion through tenders.
In these tenders, banks auction interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send to tender forty billion dollars, and then another twenty-four billion will be facilitated by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states agree on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in his customer report.
“This coordinated action by central banks likely slowed the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent sixty billion dollars on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
“Central banks should really be afraid of what awaits them even when they decided to take this step,” said ABN Amro’s chief economist Kieran Davies.
“It seems like the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same access to loans problems and that they will have to lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate that is used for lending money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even as central banks in the U.S., Canada and Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
“It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks helps to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now emerged with the closure of the UN’s international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
“There the debates are barely structured, they are artificial fires of words, substitutes for the solution to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this topic is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his translated book in German because, as he said, "many times I only encounter the caricature of my ideas."
Interested parties can now be informed about their various opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement on the warming of the planet among scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor represent possible disasters and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are in vain, useless and useless.
In addition, as a man experienced with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose untested opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
To the questions of the present, he repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable environmental advocates but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers were given the date and therefore failed to change their old driver’s license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for change so that officials will give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the roads without the valid card.
According to traffic, the carnage hasn’t changed mainly those who don’t even want to drive anymore.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in carnage change, the offices of the metropolis are full of requests and interest in the new carnage has increased.
The City Council calculates about 2,000 daily clients.
A half hour is expected in the queues.
In Prague, about 140,000 new drivers have not yet been removed.
The issue of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay fifty crowns.
Drivers who must change their license plate and do not reach the end of the year, but will go out on the roads without the valid license, will be at risk of a fine starting in January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the breach with a warning.
In case of an administrative offence, the fine will amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a person who does not go anywhere could receive a fine.
They could probably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to moderately enter fines of one thousand crowns, at most.
According to the spokesman for the transport ministry, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driving license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don’t want to drive should hand over the driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers will gradually have to go about changing the other types of driver’s license.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to Berdych's accomplice detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych will spend 13 to 10 years in prison.
The Prague Superior Court decided as the final deadline the reduction of sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives of the Prague department against organized crime were initially going to fall between the ages of 14 and 12.
The decision of today can no longer be appealed, only by the revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this case charged but he is awaiting first the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this, he has already been sentenced in other proceedings to a total of 16 years.
You can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement in the arrest of 19 people and today the Supreme Court revoked 16 of them.
Most of the defendants’ accusations were rejected by the investigation because they were invented causes.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members in accordance with Berdych passed information from police sources to the criminals, covered up the thefts, and helped the members of the criminal group avoid punishments.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The indictment refers to the criminal acts committed by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As for the theft, their victims suffered serious health impacts but are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without a gun permit.
In the home registry, police found pistols, steel core ammunition, a laser driver, and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the indictment, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of nearly twenty men in this process, the court has already found Berdych and other defendants guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring other trials, and in some cases have not yet appeared.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who have so far avoided trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the Czech authorities.
One account to change a few children: 12 million
For changing a few children in the maternity home the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital in T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l is in principle not in accordance with Veleba's proposal.
"We don't approve of that demand, it's too high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's meeting.
“In order for us to get an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty sent to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a residual value.
We remain in the opinion that there will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said.
The amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>’s family wanted, for every month they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as the basis for negotiating the compensation of the specialist's report, only that it was developed at the hospital of the Motol faculty in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better supported by men although they struggled with recriminations for the change of girls.
Women carry him worse with the trauma they are currently living and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba added.
Veronica and Nicola were replaced by nurses at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebic maternity home last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xBD> and P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>.
The governor of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, handed over 100,000 crowns to each family at the end of October as compensation for the mistake made at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must withdraw from the reserve fund and can exceptionally ask for help from the administrator.
The court to date recognized them a proportionately low compensation, the sums calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the lawsuit over the Kingdom of Valaquia brand.
According to the judge of the Ostrava provincial court it was the first to use the Kingdom of Valaquia brand but the project was created for many years by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> with whom the actor collaborated.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not present herself today in oral view.
According to your lawyer, the cause is probably not over and your client will appeal.
“The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasites of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka’s popularity,” Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka’s lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Valaquia, everyone comes to him the image of the actor and comic.
The same idea has Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
“We have about 10 years of work behind us.
Searching for money and inventing activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is money.
“After years, I have realized that the project is successful and that I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work,” he added.
A Profitable Business
According to the court the brand Kingdom of Valaquia was first used by Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in his television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
Then it was not about guiding him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> was asked to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From that comic origin came a business and a lucrative business activity of which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> later created the company Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to use his name and signature on passports and even offered his owners discounts to visitors to his farm and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also determined today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used a simple idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka made public on the stage for her own business benefit.
“It is clear that Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia,” the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who devoted themselves entirely to it.
The collaboration between the now decomposed parties continued until the year 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka the official coronation in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
From then on there began to be conflicts between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> whose culmination came with the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the chosen one forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, was derived from the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, as the mother queen.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed an indictment against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his society, which to this day has been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, who are already preparing Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
The new king should come out of him.
He didn’t want to reveal any more data or dates.
“We have no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can present himself," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
I’ve never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its drive characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, exists on the market, and this one, is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five-door, I complained, for example, about the headspace in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer from the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
Step inside quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only flaw is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate more the invention of design although already the car seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when we complained about short seats and backrests.
Also unlike the model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the body measurements have grown.
In the Combi disappears the aforementioned lack of space in the header.
Suitcases to the Suitcase
But the main thing in this vehicle is your luggage.
This should be rated as very accessible (thanks to the folding rear door) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that provide an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and they can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But we stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic mode it has a capacity of 428 liters which in comparison with the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the same type of vehicle sold in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav model, we find that the Peugeot is left behind with its noticeable 52 liters.
On holiday abroad or when placing your child’s stroller your value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I should quote the floor that remains quite flat after knocking down the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four gears
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth is what a 1600 should look like that would depreciate the familiar five doors.
It is silent, consumes little and above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the <0xC5><0xA0>KODA then that it seemed as if the exhaust pipe was plugged in by a trap, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with 1400 injection ignition for 329,900 crowns, still can.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The Premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbags in the headers, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wipers, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It’s a lot, but it has the team’s add-ons on the Fabia and it will come to a pretty similar number.
Now it is only up to you to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools.
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries attend, and therefore, locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record those cases where conflicts between emigrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is very well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where conflicts between Slovak natives and emigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and bronches among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was picking sticks at a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense she said the girl was insulting her son with racist tone insults.
The police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls hugged him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
“When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him I was leaving him, he made us the bait for throwing us apples and pears, and then he took off his pants and showed us his ass," another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student, was described.
Complaints are on both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with migrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above, show us how the environment in English schools is beginning to be quite tense.
In Britain, there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools in the Czech Republic.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled, whenever you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
the palm trees and everything included with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean Sea island you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island finds much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Greater Antilles.
In the Spanish era, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and port of cargo of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
And then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 20s.
He sent him to build one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, as everything that was criminalized in the US (and therefore banned) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings emerged, through wide avenues running cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a hacienda in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio they left their signatures the stars of the world of spectacle and politicians from all over America.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita ab<0xC3><0xA1>nen you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, cocktails are mixed according to your wishes.
And those cars already in the cult of the 1950s, still operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived a long time ago have oxidized between these wet and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old neighborhood, is deteriorating noticeably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments as there are in the surrounding area.
Other places are metamorphosed into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money needed, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguin and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the unique world and that is highly valued by railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the huge plantations to the sugar mills by narrow pathways in steam or electric machines.
Their cars for decades were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose brother models that exist in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The best known place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, there is no need to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the already mentioned Hemingway estate there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not stop visiting it.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows on limestone soils.
Mogotes, limestone pylons and steep high rocks in the valley falls, and in their caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which rock valleys that hide dense vegetation are formed.
The valley is the place where the highest quality tobacco is probably grown in Cuba.
Visiting some of the pure habanera factories can be found with your final product.
Someone might find it interesting that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was filmed there.
Trinidad (country)
Old aboriginal city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French settlers who arrived later, in four centuries has hardly changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is such a remote place that even in the 50s of the last century there was no road linking it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built, and therefore nothing was destroyed, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than just an afternoon, it is worth getting to know interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n Beach or the sugar factory valley.
the night belongs to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which with its music animates the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
A small town in the far west of Cuba, some consider it to be the most beautiful on the island.
This view has certainly already been confirmed by the road itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (actually it is a cross that arrived 100 years later) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with its same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most famous, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, pure, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of Copper, the Shrine, the African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, all of which could be filled many pages.
However, as they say, it is better to see it ever.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, say Americans
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working as expected, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country coincided in Edinburgh (Scotland).
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban are growing, today the eight participating states are discussing the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the U.S. this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces into greater activity, Britain sees as a priority to strengthen the Afghan government’s authority and the delivery of development aid.
“Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population to begin economic and security development on their own," Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
The Ninety Percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to U.S. Army data is higher than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions grew by 27 percent last year, and in Helmand Province by up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which a quarter are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit as for the organization and equipment of the units.
They are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
“We will have to think seriously about specific goals for the future and how we will achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not happy to know what we have on earth and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the closing of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
Among the countries attending in recent months, there has been controversy over whether all the allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Passive was criticized, for example, Germany.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the fighting demands there are not as high as in ours, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun this week called the German soldiers vague.
"Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and posted a photograph where the British troops were playing a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
The state debt will reach a billion in 2009
For each Czech Republic, the state owes 84,000 crowns.
Total debt rose in September to 842,7 billion crowns.
This year the government planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns.
However, in early December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the economy of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic grew at the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt in early October.
For each Czech Republic, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Throughout the past year the state owed more than 111 million crowns.
“For now, it seems that thanks to next year’s low deficit, we could cross the border of a trillion crowns by 2009.
Next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and one trillion crowns,” iHNed.cz, the country’s finance economist David Marek, told the server.
Next Finance economist Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora similarly sees it: “We could spend the trillion during 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don’t know yet.
If the situation on the political scene was seen to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don't see such a change," he added.
The Doubt Grows
The state debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
State debt is paid by means of Treasury bonds, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
Foreign debt has so far grown from 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion kroner z since June was reduced by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
“The total interannual debt from the first to the third quarter created 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from obligations where there is a 20 percent growth.
It is bad that the debt is growing but on the other hand it shows that it is going to be negotiated until there is a pension reform,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
From the 2007 state debt management and payment strategy it is extracted that the government planned this year to lend 159.2 billion crowns.
At the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the state budget evolution.
The amount is composed, above all, of the deficit of the state budget this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the expected 91.3 billion crowns.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with some 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for the payment of pensions, 43 billion crowns to finance state obligations and 1.8 billion crowns in payments of loans from the European Investment Bank.
I compared today in front of a court in Jart<0xC3><0xBA>m for giving a name to a plush bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam has been sentenced Thursday afternoon by a court in Jart<0xC3><0xBA>m to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting students aged 6 to 7 give the name of Muhammad to a stuffed bear when all depictions of the prophet of Islam are illegal.
He was patient with a penalty of whiplash.
This 54-year-old British school teacher based at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, has been arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with assault on Islam and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of students to the Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the class plush bear.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the bear photo with the following caption "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the Prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' fellow Muslims, a professor at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I'm sorry I just asked the children to vote for a name," it's just an "innocent mistake" according to him.
Opinion divided by numerous schoolteacher students who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never speaks of religion in class".
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
It is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have concluded a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the statute," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
Underlining that peace in the region was " at stake " , its American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“We do not foresee violence for now but we are entering a very difficult period,” he added, noting that “obvious tensions exist”.
End of Mediation on December 10
The troika mediators, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go one last time Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90% Albanian-populated province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council by December 10.
Baden’s discussions, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was commissioned by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the granting of independence in Kosovo, insist on a pursuit of negotiations beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Khartchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of administration by the UN in Kosovo, the West considers independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to unilaterally proclaim it if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," Kosovo Autonomous Authority President Fatmir Sejdiu announced at the Baden hotel where these "last-minute negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, has given part of his grief.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to murder and deportation."
" Dominant Effect "
Serbian President Bor<0xC3><0xAD>s Tadic has considered a compromise always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said it was particularly concerned about a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a commitment is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto.
" The Parliament of Kosovo shall have the last word "
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the statute " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by Albanians would be made " in consultation " with the West.
Bush Begins Agreement Between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he met on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations in order to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between his two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised he would do anything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must put an end to its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides ' obligations regarding the peace itinerary they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would seek " to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This denomination covers the three main pilgrim problems of the point of dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the US president, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be “global and in-depth” and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things.”
Upon his return to the courthouse, Olmert pledged that future negotiations would be "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to complete them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush fixed the end of the implementation of his co-existing Palestinian and Israeli " two-state vision " .
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made an effort to do so on Bush’s part before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes to Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud estimates in his Arabic daily interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As always in these types of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the French National Police General Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17, Luisa-Miguel Street, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"It was not in intervention but in patrol, and it was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without rotating light," explains a police source.
A Kawasaki-branded green motorcycle, "unapproved, or not authorized to circulate on the public road" (read below) and driven by two helmetless youths, circulated "all gas".
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the surrender the step to the right," the police said.
The control of alcoholism practiced over the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (the collapsed front, cracked windshields, ripped bumpers) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>re de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation for " involuntary homicide and denial of aid " to the IGPN, co-hosted with the Val-d'Oise Departmental Directorate of Public Security.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor specifies that the IGPN investigation at this stage ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this minivan arrived relatively quickly to its left".
Yesterday, a type of slot, no doubt caused by the rubbing of the shoes on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been timed for the police car to come to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have gone very quickly from the site, thus not providing relief to both young people.
The IGPN, being cautious, would also set aside " all serious shortcomings " on this point.
"It's the most difficult aspect of the investigation, it needs more investigation, about which one must be very careful," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of its windows that precisely gives to the scene.
“We then went down with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital to try to resuscitate them,” the witness said.
There was nothing to do.”
Then he saw " a completely terrified policeman, who was barking.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, apparently, with the certainty that the people present in the unexpected situation of the young, the police have been driven by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
Always according to this witness, the reliefs arrived "about twenty minutes after the march of the police".
They also performed heart massages, in vain.
" I will not allow it to be assumed that police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firemen arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions Rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday repressed the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, nearly 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, witnesses said.
The latter replied with stone shots, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been questioned.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been interrogated.
In Islamabad, the Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers' movement gathered on Monday the support of religious parties regrouped in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president "called on the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the state of emergency and the waste to whom they swore an oath in front of Musharraf."
" Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled "
The Supreme Court of Pakistan refers directly to the measure of exception proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to decide in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on October 6, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
“Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court’s rulings,” the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president "no longer values" after the establishment of the state of emergency, Information Assistant Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform here on November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy head of the army.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unforeseeable
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Still today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) are not expected, according to a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), 40 years after the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
However, the liberalization of contraception allowed for a better "fertility domain", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years has gone from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less per month for a couple of every five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most enjoyable to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his International Space Station (ISS) crewmates to perform the spectacular repair of a tear-down and indispensable solar panel to continue the station’s scientific activities.
A risky exit that amassed records due to its duration, its removal from habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "sharpened" by astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had released the Harmony module from the Discovery launcher, a thick cylindrical piece in charge of soon hosting the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing gear for the modules-laboratory.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After displacing it, the crew began reorganizing the solar panels of the module that have a span of 76 meters.
And that’s where one of the panels, which unfold as accordions, has been damaged in just over a meter by a cable that has been ripped off.
The display has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
The astronauts, who initially had to perform a check-out of the Discovery launcher, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to the end of the 30 meters long remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to carry out the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Tall, sturdy, very skillful, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been tasked with "operating" the "wound" solar panel.
After having precisely inspected the damage, it cut off the faulty cable and installed "table" types in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second "spacewalker " who had stayed close to the air lock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, an insulator-wrapped hockey mini-bar to avoid electrocution in solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "scattered" by astronauts aboard the station.
Upon completion of the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a half-day rest before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for the return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the Stock Exchange
The EADS stock is currently in sharp decline at the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautical and defense group announced it had tended to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with A400M delays.
EADS currently loses 4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.96 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its 2007 operating result forecast in response to delays generated by the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft’s maiden flight.
The cost to mitigate the delay in delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the home of the European constructor EADS.
Due to these loads, EADS will be forced to announce new operating result (EBIT) targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without any further cryptic accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be remembered that EADS operating result failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to loads linked to delays in another program, that of the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the ballot box: the Russians are going to massively opt for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today directs voters a televised message about public chains, already registered but the contents of which are kept secret.
He does so as leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president didn’t let anything get transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting to deliver a new charge against the West accused of interference – his topic of preference during the campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and we want fairer, more transparent and more open elections, no incident elections,” he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
Report a campaign under pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there has never been such a dirty election, even in the time of Yeltsin.
After the crackdown on demonstrations over the past weekend, former world champion Jaque Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, is banned, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians saved the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
The Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful united Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever the case, in legislative elections as well as in presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel owners of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin re-established the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic outpouring," said Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians “willfully renounce personal responsibility” of those who had briefly given evidence after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon touches all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of that the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: "What to reflect for?
Those in power aren’t too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million files, stored over 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not so far available only for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and nominally, at the request of an ex-victim or his right-holders.
The eleven states in charge of its management – such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to open them to seekers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
The historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to conduct searches "particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, the director of these files administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nomination documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the supposed homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the deported or subjected to forced labour and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their indemnification.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t in Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches around 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The European Union's foreign ministers had given their approval last April to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
“A free trade pact will do very much to both economies,” and “India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” argued Peter Mandelson.
Europe represented the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants change annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", had declared this week Daniele Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation to the European Parliament and to the European Parliament.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about easing the current turn of concerns about credit conditions, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion offer at the 5.75% base rate in five weeks, an unusually long offer.
" To alleviate concerns that the conditions of the financial market will be particularly tightened at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of their expected reserve contribution during the period of open-ended trading.
The bank needs 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) to be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until January 10.
This is the first time that the BoE Bank of England seems to put liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that " it is prepared to take other measures to maintain " interbank lending rates per day in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5,829% on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6.6%, higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England have been combined with a significant penalty index that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the change in the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny consideration of PS party proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group on Thursday refused to discuss articles of the socialist law proposal on purchasing power, which amounts to a devaluation of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS's national office, including a 50% increase in overwork for employment, the re-establishment of the TIPP (internal rate for oil products) floating, a check-report, or a check-report.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session has been raised at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes live, between majority and opposition a few hours after Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS deputy leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the corrective finance bill reviewed by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is coming out
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who inspired, more or less, the current movement of festivals in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio after, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizing tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" he has ever attended, C3's Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn's work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as the market and worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we are stuck in low-level policies because of the current administration, pursues Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival at an exceptional venue that recently took place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurfaced the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, having dissipated in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban setting.
“The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while ours are rather held in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both an impression of a rural festival to the European and urban way to the American way.”
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says this festival’s hotel offer is “very big,” for example, that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been issued to the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under the press.
“Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 teammates, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal in front of Terminator
It’s not easy to lure Hollywood movie dishes to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to compete with the Governor?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it’s going.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best,” he says.
The Race to the Festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte’s priority is to promote the film here.
The Oscars race has begun.
All West Coast festivals, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present Quebec films, give them value and make sure that the filmmakers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on a poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four shorts at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? The experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks before the close of the exercise, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, this year experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock exchange usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not advisable to make forecasts based solely on statistics, especially because in the current context, uncertainties are lurking in the markets, at least in the short term.”
Although they are not supporters of the stock market taking off in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing to quality values both in long stretches and in color."
Therefore, they believe the stock market will have a rather side-by-side, non-volatility-free behavior “especially because the impact of the likely decline in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions.”
Javier Barrio, head of BPI sales in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there is going to be a rally.
“It’s not the thing for many joys,” says the expert.
The Ibex has lost about 4% from the highs set on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to portfolio restructuring and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert points out that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes the rally will take place in the second week of December, after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said: “We are close to technical levels and could therefore see a rebound in the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the US as to the consequences of the crisis on the credit market.”
The analyst is confident that they will be positive.
Analysts agree on choosing the values that will be in charge of taking Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that “this year is about great values.”
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco assures that the increases will come from the hands of the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, if given.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other builders like Ferrovial and FCC to follow the same path,” the expert explains.
cyclical consumption will play a key role in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a bassist month on only two occasions.
The authentic end-of-year rally was held in 2003, an exercise in which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the technological bubble pinching.
This year, when the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a rebound of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (currently the Ibex is up 8.36% since January) and if it can count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate much of its offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group that decides to give the jump to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 in the afternoon, and open on Saturdays from 10 hours to 20.30 in the afternoon.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that wanted to expand the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its offices on Saturday in exchange for opening an afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of Popular’s experience will be decisive for other entities to point to this initiative that is secondary to the trading schedules.
This is exactly the goal that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture the particular customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, autonomous people and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling of the existing ones.
To do this, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by customers from different streets.
In this way, the extension of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the space of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, says this restructuring is not a big investment, although a larger hiring of staff, since it goes from having about six employees per location to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to gather there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, explains <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems to be right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 operate under the Mundocredit brand, which specializes in immigrants, also with very broad schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these locations PopularMax will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero said.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time in the stock market of its rival Antenna 3
We've got it.
With that phrase he expressed his satisfaction yesterday Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the closing of the market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
“There was only one aspect of his joy: ‘It’s what hurts me, not because we’ve grown more, but because we’ve fallen less,’” he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, ‘we have fallen less’.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That profit places its loss on what we have been doing year on year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and held by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488,88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which fell 1.52% yesterday and accumulated a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (editor of Five Days) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first TV channel to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenue, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the subsidiary that manages the group’s advertising.
If this data were to become reality, the television network would record an increase of 3.6% in its advertising revenue from the year 2006 of 965.4 million.
For its part, the net revenue of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while the net revenue of TV grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point out for the best relative evolution in Bolsa de Telecinco is the high pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
“We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, which we have already given value to with 33% of Endemol."
According to analysts, the market is showing some tiredness at this time.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 by 4% and in 2009, by 7%.
It is due, they explain, to the fact that the projected revenue growth has been reduced from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antena 3’s profit forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves transposition of Mifid, which entered into force on November 1
In parallel to its parliamentary process, which ended today with the vote by the Congress of the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to public hearing the regulations to be developed by the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to ensure the protection of investors and regulate in detail the activity of the entities for the markets to function efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, while reinforcing investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow to provide financial advisory services to both specialized firms and individuals or legal entities and create a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory societies (FIs), which join the securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of operations on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment services companies to disclose information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all operations they perform, to facilitate oversight by the CNMV.
In its passage by the Congressional Economics Commission, several modifications were incorporated, among which it highlights that securitized debts are considered a “complex” financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated with the debt of high-risk U.S. mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics and Business can develop 30 years after the actual decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists was passed in 1977.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of others, will not require authorization from the CNMV and will be able to provide its services of marketing products and customer acquisition to different investment companies at once.
Harmonized CPI increases five-tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which later serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an advance on how prices in Spain evolved during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide comparable data on time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The above indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of its publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the forward indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to match the final date, which will be announced next December 14.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second vice president and economy minister, Pedro Solbes, has stated that the rise in 4.1% of the CPI in November is a “temporary figure”, but at the same time has pledged that the price index will continue at “relatively high” levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of Congress that “although the figure is not good” Spain’s inflation differential with respect to monetary union remains “more or less” the same in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not have such a high rise.
“We expected a figure of around 4%,” the Minister of Economy acknowledged with respect to the figure ahead today.
Virgin plans to raise <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.8 billion) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At that time, it was amassing record deposits above <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months due to the distrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of one hundred percent of that money offered by the Government and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues in British banks that are deposited in the next three years to achieve those remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion to reach the target of <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for his eye-catching advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50 million (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named Virgin’s consortium offer, in which three other companies are participating, as its favorite to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the People’s Party) this morning for his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot unfolded this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then mayor of the municipality, and that according to sources of research consulted by the SER chain, could be the 'header' of this plot.
The officers continue to register the municipal units and the City Council and no further arrests will be ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, he has been charged with the libel of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot uncovered earlier this week.
As the SER chain reported yesterday, Juan Morales, the lawyer of the so-called “popular” MP, was stopped leaving Morales’s home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the research, according to research sources, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people have been arrested.
Bono agrees to lead the PSOE’s bid for Toledo and chair the Congress if they win the
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to head the PSOE list for Toledo for the upcoming general elections and be president of Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced at a press conference by PSOE Organization Secretary José Blanco and Bono himself, after the meeting he has held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he pointed out that "it seems" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over Congress if the socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n as president of Congress, who made public on November 15th his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his career in active politics to fight climate change in the university sphere.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president of the government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over Congress, in an “act of transparency”.
If he reaches office, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or shouting" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk calmly and with sociage is Congress, the president of the government has been interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, and “his good work” and has not wanted to be seen already occupying his position so as not to fall into what, he said, his opponents could see as “prepotence.”
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate change movement is subject to relentless persecution by both the skeptics of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it is bound to show an iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and believes that that struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a “new contract with the planet”.
That approach forces you to explain why the action, or inaction, of your government has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who are responsible for the breach, in what sectors it has occurred and why its government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires it to explain with maximum clarity to the Spaniards what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to make, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been or will not be such explanations.
It’s because it’s about getting paid and getting paid.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the cent of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so electorally dangerous to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With impactful phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it’s limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and you don’t want us to ride a bike or cool off with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hotel businessman for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation reported today.
The edril was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose offices he is currently with numerous agents, who have also visited the City Council of Urbanism and the municipal management company of the Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three arrests add to the six carried out last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the redevelopment of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two others were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs the Court No. 1 of Totana.
The first six arrests have now been made available to the court.
According to sources, the former mayor of Totana and now the PP’s autonomous parliamentarian, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as well as the current girlfriend of the former mayor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Sole de Inmonuar, an agency integrated in the aforementioned Group, and through which bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Group of Urban Crimes of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven records, most in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a well-known poultry products company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were reclassified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the nearby car parks in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico square; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Advises, focused on the promotion, sale and installation.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by the way at the head of the PISA report on educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of Blackbur’s book.
“The content of the Philosophy signature has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the deaths, a bachelor’s student, cited in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Councilor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes.

A colleague passes information on the introduction to the Criminal Code of Internet Download Crimes:
A. The downloading of a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to one year.
Instead, if you steal discs worth less than 400 euros in the store, it is considered simply missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to 1,000 euros in the store, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the discharge charge (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of the discharge (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous row has a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected and unlicensed films by the authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
In the end, if my colleague is right, someone is shaking hands, a very long hand.

My GP gives me one of his articles on rare research titled, “Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less.”
That is, the feelings generated by workers’ monthly pay depend on what their peers earn.
The study has been conducted through tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.”
The researchers noted that if both of them got the same paycheck, the activation was moderate, but if one received double, the activation was higher.
I don't know if this conclusion was required by so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing the war criminals of the Balkans for eight years since the prosecution of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bittersweet taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre – in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died – former General Ratko Mladic and former Serb leader Radovan Karadzic remain at large.
His names are on that list from which takes its title the documentary of the Swiss director Marcel Sch<0xC3><0xBC>pbach, 'The List of Carla' (2006, not released in Spain) which, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the fugitive criminals and pressuring the governments.
Which insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of possible accidents, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, card age, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having a car is just the beginning.
And that is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is embodied in an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being liable for the obligation to pay the compensation in case of bankruptcy.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, the age of the carne, the marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on the statistics, so the more likely they are to suffer an accident, the higher the fee to pay.
It is for this reason that both adults over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as the statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of sinestrality due to their prudence.
Also, taking into account the numbers, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the likelihood of having some kind of permanence.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
It is for this reason that the driver has to study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various drawbacks when it comes to hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and the age of the car.
While the ideal to be well-insured is all-risk insurance, there are other cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for an entire risk with franchise, so they get insurance coverage at all risk but at a more feasible price.
This type of agreement would require the customer to pay a portion of the sinestra amount.
“The part of the amount of the sinester that the customer provides will be pre-set based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount,” said Luis Noguera, chief executive officer in Spain of First Europe, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not to those caused in their own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A piece of advice.
If you are under the age of 25 try to be careful and avoid sinister as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, being able to reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate owned by the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on that base rate.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its benefit.
If the company has had a good year, it will be possible to increase the bonuses,” explains Noguera.
After the age of 25 drivers have it easier when it comes to hiring insurance, as the rate of sine-estrality is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to hire an entire risk franchise.
“Normally, young people can’t make use of the experience previously acquired when using an accident, and even when driving,” says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the ‘fear of the novice’ has passed.
However, if the client is married but still does not have children it is preferable to negotiate insurance at all risk, as long as their economic situation allows it, of course.
For its part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest rate of sinestraality, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at all risk with franchise (which could be 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one at third party extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
“They carry out a more relaxed driving and have a greater purchasing power to allow themselves the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchise,” Luis Noguera said.
For retirees it is recommended to have insurance at all risk with franchise (being this one 150 euros), or one to third party extended when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the event of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic looking for a point worth the eighth in Milan
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they need to achieve their respective goals in closing the league of the 'Champions', as the Italians serve them to be first and the Scots to judge their classification.
The Italians add ten points and have already certified on the fifth day their pass with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to ensure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that he receives Benfica, who has four, does not advance.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to compete in the Club World Cup in Japan, where they debut on day 13 in semi-finals in search of a place for the final of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw at Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to come out for a win, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better cross in eighths.
Gordon Strachan's team could even serve as a defeat to qualify if Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't be trusted because equal to nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to bitter the night to the Scots, who trust to get into eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last season with a Kaka goal in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 away.
Expecting the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar to which only the victory is worth, in case he loses the Celtic, both to get into the eighth and to continue in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with a win, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators since they disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place Vancouver group.
Around 20,000 people ran out of tickets to attend the concert that included a video that tells the story of the group that angered in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that picks up its main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five Spice Girls members came out on stage wearing bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the audience who clung to GM Place, even though Victoria’s nerves had banned him days earlier.
On the eve of the show’s start, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star “has not seen our costume at all, so I’m nervous about what she’s going to think about the show.”
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the quintet to dissolve two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the show began.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said of the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, “things have been fixed and we all love each other very much.”
But many things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon arrival at the airport, an army of nannies was waiting for them.
Of the five, seven are children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will play in Madrid on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia’s export of fuel to Western Europe.
The majority of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rock between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopolistic gas owner, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money Ukraine was due to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it will charge Ukraine more, as it has pledged to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be Ukraine paying 40% more for Gazprom’s imports.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
“Changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations of Central Asia.
NHS ‘must test foreign workers’
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor criminal background records of employees outside of Europe, a watchdog said.
The general auditor Robert Black’s recommendation came after a foreign doctor was found to be related to the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Black also showed his concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of how many foreign personnel it has.
However, her report pointed out other controls that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European economic area, following the attacks at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after striking a jeep at the gates of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attacks in the UK.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks on candidates, to ensure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although Scotland's health board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside the UK.
The Auditor General’s report recommends, among other measures, that the boards should have guidance from the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside the UK.
“While we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review,” the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: “Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that necessary information is available in the number of foreign NHS staff.”
BMA Scotland president Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he explained.
Scottish health authorities say there are currently 1,161 foreigners, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, in part because the boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely complied with.
This includes passport controls, work permit, and qualifications check.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide for foreigners in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “It was of great interest that this work was carried out in the wake of the Glasgow airport terrorist attack.
He added that the Scottish government, along with health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of pre-employment control guides for all working groups – including foreigners – what they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates the film awards
Control, the biographical film about Joy Division late vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for best film.
The trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress by the thriller "Notes of a Scandal".
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film – in black and white – featuring the soundtracks of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – was produced with only <0xC2><0xA3>3,000.
But he also won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic caratula of U2’s Joshua Tree album, awarded with two awards – best director and best debutant director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning ceremony – such as Julien Temple’s film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, won the award for best documentary.
The award for best actor was won by Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a London-based Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg’s Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for hard play, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The fifth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named in honor of Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it’s really an honor.”
The Independent Film Awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Fans and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia said it had arrested 208 militants of terrorist cells who were planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda supporters have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants formed by foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000-strong force to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world’s largest oil plant, after a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi interior minister, said 18 of the arrested belonged to a cell led by a "missile-launching expert" who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning the killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active to stop Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining al-Qaeda as militants to fight the allied forces and to support the Muslim Shiite government, which is considered heretical by the most extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the royal family’s government-dominated policies.
The militants — recruited by calls from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the country’s pro-Western government — targeted foreign residences associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, since five months of work," the Interior Minister's spokesman told state television.
The arrests also include a 16-person "media cell" in Medina, whose goal was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims considered infidel and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 other people charged with providing financial support and support to the militants.
Venus' climate may give an idea of Earth's future
Venus may have once been an appropriate place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a twin Earth than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had similar conditions to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has been studying the planet for a year, provide an overview of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the University of Oxford’s Department of Physics and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, says: “It’s becoming clear why the weather on Venus is so different from Earth, when it’s two planets so similar.
“Our new data make it possible to build a scenario where Venus started as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago.”
Police decommissioning "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they declare to be enriched uranium, was decommissioned yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
It's still open
Mitt Romney says it’s not worthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record questions in video and send them for dissemination among the candidates.
None of the questions posed on Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than the snow monkey who asked Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican party on YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party in the face of next year’s elections.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to aspirants.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to raise the dial when they heard ideas they liked: broadcasters noticed approval spikes when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The night’s harshest word exchanges were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a pointer in crucial surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation as he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an “amnesty” (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, got along with the issue.
No one has the word to be nominated, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share points of view: increased border surveillance, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fear of China’s toxic toys and other overseas concerns, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other issues appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – now, against all expectations, first in Iowa’s most recent survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the election.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is stepping up in Iowa, coinciding with Liberal Ron Paul’s fundraising campaigns, and his heated statements from Wednesday’s debate.
The two have emerged from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America’s greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the game is split and the result is far from clear.
Dolores Laboristas
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it also emerges.
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They don’t seem to have sold out influences, nor are they exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor extramarital finger sucking.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the British Labour government party, worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million), for about four years using fake names, and that the party did not denounce it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election, foolishly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and trial poverty in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative loophole.
A trio of retired generals began a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a half-time job.
Now they are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary-General (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it’s clear that the prime minister can’t make things better, that he doesn’t have much time left, that suspension is all the more: public officials are starting to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government gets defensive and doesn’t focus.
On the one hand, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that it is new.
Although he wanted to renege on Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as chancellor of the errory.
And even though it’s not directly involved in Blairish’s setbacks — or “partners’ cash,” the political party funding investigation — voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, not been cheated directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what the naturally Stalinist tendencies of Mr. Brown have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with gifts of charity, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be so, but the decision is not made by him.
The laws against anonymity for major political taxpayers are clear and there is a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abraham’s agreement, and that it was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraising who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these performances, although the bulk of the payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but is dilute in decision-making by a family matter, a commission of inquiry on the matter—conducted, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Committee on Standards in Public Life, since he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for genuine reform of party funding.
This will require hard cooperative labor with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the unions - bitter measures for a partisan like Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is in acting with impeccable probabilities and solid competition.
Sharks cards
The Mortgage Crisis Subprime Is Infecting the American Credit Card Market?
When there’s blood in the water, it’s natural for back fins to swim excitedly around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their sights set on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis infects other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that have more than 30 days delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken over 1.4 million positions in its U.S. consumer finance business, in part due to the weakness of card lenders.
However, it is very early for panic.
Latency and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody’s, a rating agency, the third quarter’s crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American People's Bankruptcy Act (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in Bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of latency) would be growing again, or it could happen that the conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of its debt consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is pretty strong, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emissions volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are running out.
But credit card issuers look more at cash flow than asset values, so falling prices don’t necessarily drive a change in borrowers’ creditworthiness.
They can even work to take advantage of the transmitters.
Incentives for consumers to continue cushioning the mortgage decline if the properties are worth less than the loan value; and as a result, the payment of card debt rises to the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid asset retracement.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans,” said Gary Perlin, chief financial officer of Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit crunch pushes America into recession, the industry is undoubtedly facing a more severe future.
You have to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British banker found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility in the frauds with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became a famous cause in Britain for extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after Enron's 2001 collapse.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to have alerted Fastow in 2002 that it was the target of a government investigation into Enron's fall.
The indictment against the bankers - dubbed the "NatWest Three" - alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron society controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of frauds in Enron, which helped his spiral into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary’s interests at zero, but the three Britons knew it would value on the rise.
A company under Kopper’s control bought the subsidiary’s bank interest at $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers collected 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two counts of conspiracy in the collapse of Enron.
The trio of Britons were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make its failing businesses seem successful.
The collapse caused thousands of jobs to be lost, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron’s founder, Kenneth Lay, and former chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling, were in charge last year for their roles in the company’s collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Not down or out in Moscow.
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly direct from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
“It has a capacity of up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
“But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it’s for private family flights or for presidents of a company.”
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day consumer orgy held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract new wealthy Russians to all kinds of products, from mahogany-crafted yachts to diamond-encrusted car grills worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks cautiously at a bright orange Porsche in the stand next to his."
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and cauldron compared to us," he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.”
Fueled by the oil boom, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when it was on the high.
“We lived the same way back in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came together in Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
“Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the world’s largest consumers and spenders.”
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their part of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a luxury industry conference will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-rate rich include 103 billion Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think-thanks.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
“Women are flawlessly prepared and men are very worthy.”
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in an afternoon suit, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit he wore as a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum shorts, M<0xC3><0xB6>venpick ice cream, custom pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically in a stand of Dutch royal Delft porcelains, in front of a wall-sized reconstruction of a painting by Rembrandt, made of hand-painted tiles.
“Of course, the Russians are more interested in the ‘bling-bling’.
In fact, the sellers said that the rich Russians of the most trajectory (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from striking logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people: cash millionaires, millionaires’ emissaries or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of the King Koil beds, said he sold two mattress systems of $70,000 each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three chain-shaped car grilles to Rolls Royce Phantom for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with embedded rays of Swarovski-colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
“The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes won’t necessarily drive on those wheels,” Mr. Karapetian says.
“He’s going to keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars.”
Even if many of his Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karapetian makes it clear that the phrase “Russian millionaire” does not mean exclusivity, given the surge in real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if you’re not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich with the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths filled with one million-dollar fake ticket piles.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped shaking up piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their phones while resting on heaps of money, or pocketing a couple of millions.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” says Karryev.
‘Snapshot’ surgery could cause death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant “A Little Healthier” and saw an ambulance go up White Cape Cod, two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police car appeared from the police patrol.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance go up," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant's supervisor, that day Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works at West Scott Avenue 212's house.
The authorities still do not determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but wait for the toxicology test although the results will not be available for a few weeks. This will help solve the mysterious death that has plagued the upper ranks of Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been an assistant to the director of police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," McCarthy said of Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me.”
Mr McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcohol Control Commission, and who left two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for the County Union Attorney, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
“That’s one of the possibilities,” Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m.
On November 21st, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
It’s been more than a week and authorities have said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say whether Mrs. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
The researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door at Mrs. Castro's home, where a marquis rose is located in the front of the house, and a thief's dalmatian in the back.
A blue drum labeled "vainillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was found at the car door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks to one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its harsh political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch with this or that one,’” he said.
“She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn’t.
It's embarrassing."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to raise the stock market
Shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to ease credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which were increased with the calming comments of the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
The stock exchanges eased in London, New York and across Europe after Ben Bernanke’s number two Donald Kohn, president of the reserve, declared that policymakers should be “flexible and pragmatic” in responding to the continued tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid rising credit market samples, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence was “partly reversed by the improvement in the market in late September and during October.”
If the upward trend persisted, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
Observations also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales that hit the record low in October.
The consequences of financial turbulence were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset losses on its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those positions are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, at closing to 13,289.40, while the S&P 500 broad index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of Britain’s top companies.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6%, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Earlier, it was highlighted the resurgence of credit stress in the markets after a strong demand in a three-month fund auction of the European Central Bank, which considered those loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Federal Reserve and the ECB’s action and inject extra funds into London’s stock markets strained the credit and lending rates to three months “free” among British banks, which meant the biggest increase since September, of 6.59%, after a no-show.
England takes trial on the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas here, each as difficult as the other.
Who should beat No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And none is less important than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is on loan – with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, the director of England, is starting to fill in bids to become a non-national selector.
Those who don’t get sixth place will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the bottom level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than capacity.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, because judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say which is a good level for a cricketer, unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim at the next chance?
The figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but so do they have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the captain’s eye at the same time as taking a “wicket” and a batsman to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to make an impact as a player someday.
But capturing the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who certainly plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself to “fit and bowl” like the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of them.
The games of Shah or Bopara at the Asgiriya stadium can only be a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man’s career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who came to become a major player, and despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion at today’s session at the Asgiriya stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah’s greatest experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable early 88 debut test in Bombay, 32 first-class centenarians versus only 6 Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has an excellent record against spin bowling.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two May turns against West Indians in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next encounter, it seemed to have taken from his "batting" some momentum than in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team is happy to live in swords.
He is arrested for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he flipped his vehicle at an exhibition for England car sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate looking at the distance, to say excitedly, “Did you see that?”
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slip pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not excel, as the tea leaves suggest, he is the one who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work – and the fight against Al Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the refugees who were left without cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who led them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and it’s safe now.”
“They say Mahdi’s army stopped killing people,” he says, referring to Shiite militia of religious militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to stop for a moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa to Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shi’ite neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an allied U.S. force helped take Al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan’s recent arrivals was the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had been driven from their home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after urging citizens to rise up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues.”
“That’s why I came back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were drawn to the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops established groups of “worried citizens,” armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many claimed to have returned for visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, gave voice to the common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees’ visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," he said.
“I can’t believe in a government that supports the criminals who set my house on fire after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that Sunnis have been expelled from Shia areas and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will bring sectarian tensions back up and the struggle begins.
The little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sarandese lack only an educational field.
“Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlander that we are not French – that was the ironic bike about ourselves from the smallest federal state for its fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saar, which in a study by the Institute of German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" took fifth place.
In this way, high schools by tradition have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbr<0xC3><0xBC>cken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their university career here with two or three diplomas.
Therefore, the percentage of foreign students is high, of 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than the average in high schools, many of whom do not have a baccalaureate.
“The Saar uses the system of vocational education,” says Axel Pl<0xC3><0xBC>nnecke, an expert in the education sector at the Institute of German Economy (IW).
More than one in five young people do their bachelor’s degree in the Professional School, so it turns out that Sarre is 7 points above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety the range of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, relative to the population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical professional training and increasing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Sarre Ministry of Education forced higher schools to do more advertising for the specialities in Engineering Sciences.
“After the first PISA study, we made some reforms in schools of general education,” says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative tests across the country.
For children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. In the meantime, this model also mimics the other federal states.
The comparison with the upcoming studies will show whether it has increased student performance.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students who were late in school development decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
But overall, the Sarre didn’t improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the detriment of the Sarandese, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Sarandese are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory subject in the Secondary Education Institutes.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez changes the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez lets the schedule in the South American country be changed by delaying the half-hour clock.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is now a comedian in Spain.
As the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State has reported, according to the new law, the time will pass less than four hours GMT.
Thus the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, as the enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States would in its day impose an obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced the rupture of relations with his neighboring country Colombia due to the action with hostage taking.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Uribe remains the president of Colombia.
“My dignity does not allow me to do so,” says Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is pushing for constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, their power in the country could be greatly expanded.
The reason for the conflict was Uribe’s decision to withdraw Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s mandate in negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was about the release of the hostages.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez said Sunday that the decision made by Uribe has offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: “Why don’t you shut up?” is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who was upset by the continuous interruptions by left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decline in real wages threatens German employees despite a strong economic downturn.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Hans B<0xC3><0xB6>ckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real-wage account in 2007 than the previous year.
“The fault of that is the weak evolution of wages, the rise in value-added tax and the tightening of food and energy prices,” Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Research of Economic Cycles told the Bild newspaper.
The new unemployment insurance charges may also apply to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck told the newspaper Neue Ostanbr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% as it passes from one year to another is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a politician from the German Social Democratic Party.
On Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food and oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, these are increasing by 3%.
Venus: twin brother of Earth.
Despite its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to Earth, something that had not yet been proposed. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and swirls in the poles, the same ones that also appear in winter on Earth.
For the past three decades, researchers have suspected that there could be rays on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, the rays fall from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles to the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous Urey-Miller origin model, lightning caused life on Earth: storms may have caused reactions in the ocean that, for their part, had given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it is not so: if there ever was life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there can be no life on the surface of Venus: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface they reign temperatures of 500<0xC2><0xB0>C, oscillating so that temperatures can be reached below zero.
“Possibly, Venus is a ‘devilish’ twin of Earth, but it remains a twin,” Russell said.
The main objective of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many "Nature" articles, according to the researchers, highlight not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
“This also demonstrates that neighboring planets have more common features with Earth than we had assumed,” ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, the researchers also discovered in the southern polar region a vortex formed by the fastest rotating clouds.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high Earth's atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has a mass almost equal to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet is also called a morning star or evening star orbiting the Sun for nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: one day on Venus is equivalent to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not look much like Earth, scientists start from the base that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
Water had accumulated on both planets that remained on Earth in the oceans, but on Venus dissociated in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's rally with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Federal President Horst Koehler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and that’s why he demanded that the grand coalition end that fight for the Dalai Lama’s reception.
“In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation,” Koehler told the Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time, Koehler showed his understanding of the Dalai Lama's reception by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
“While I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me,” Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in foreign policy meddling, the Federal President stressed, defending Merkel for the reproach she received in making a new policy with China.
“The Federal Chancellor didn’t take the traditional course of Una China’s politics away.
China knows that too,” Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his displeasure at the reception of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), the German finance minister, but also, according to information sources from the magazine "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese head of government, demanded Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving the Tibetan religious leader in his official position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama demonstrated that it is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now also includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that disturbances such as those occurring in France will occur.
Battles with police on the streets, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not take to the streets.
They were barricaded, the vandals shot the police with guns: after serious riots involving young people in France, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We also have to look to our country’s social problems not to take the form of violence.”
“We have to take that seriously,” he said in the Neue Presse newspaper, published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis on solving these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: All this is already bearing its first fruits."
It's still early to set the end of the alarm aside.
At the same time, Schaeuble pointed out that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as they do in France.
The youths played the role of serious riots in the streets with police north of Paris last night.
In Tolouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany, called for greater efforts by the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the unrest in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as it is in France.
Despite this, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above the average.
It is important to ensure that there are more vocational training positions.
Kolat stresses: “We have to give a perspective to young people.”
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", larger than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, “But after all, we have to be careful.”
It must "provide the opportunity for young people to receive a job or vocational training more quickly."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police participated in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
The authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burned cars.
Since the previous day, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that the police will take strict measures until necessary.
On Monday night, around 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The unrest began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the youth was not the fault of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The performance far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content has reached its final point and that nothing more is to be expected from it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate action, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House, it must be said that she does not live in the country that would have to be ruled by her.
As for the accusation that she had repeatedly engaged in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial mode and so he showed that he does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the Lower House it was made very clear to all that this rebuke was appropriate.
There could be no minimum interest or feeling for the problems of the country.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that escapes in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: the prevention of climate change: it was highly praised for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but it says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising herself - for two years the head of the Christian Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford so much modesty.
For it engages in expressions so that an impulse comes to people.
And thus it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke the inner problems are appearances of little value.
The poverty of children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
The only thing that is dedicated is to talking about this topic using subordinate prayers.
It’s amazing how many times you’re wrong when it comes to supplementing for kids.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It begins to stumble "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was more concrete information.
The Attacks section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate by Republican presidential candidates on YouTube and now they must fear only one candidate from the outside.
From the very beginning, tensions between the candidates are noted.
Mitt Romney accused his opponent Rudy Giuliani of turning New York into a “place of refuge for illegal immigrants.”
He, for his part, responded with grave reproach: "I would like to say that his own house was a 'port' for the illegals." Giuliani replies to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: As so far the Republican group has no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were sent to YouTube, also don’t have much content.
“With this way of isolation we let Hitler come to power,” that was John McCain’s reprisal to his opponent Ron Paul, the only one of the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives much criticism from war veterans in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown simulate his death.
Public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that while the campaign’s most important topics are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised conservative values and denied the rise in taxes.
This way you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
“I was wrong at the time,” Romney said, and apologized to the public and the television audience for being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought of the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf ruled without a uniform.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pervez Musharraf, the president of Pakistan, took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his mandate as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he took power with an incredulous military coup, the former general ruled the state for the first time as a civilian chief.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state’s attorney general, after the Musharraf oath will very soon annul the state of exception and will fulfill the second condition of the West.
Since it was proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court there have been many supporters of Musharraf, and last week the country's Supreme Court rejected all the resources before the controversial new election of the head of government on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s follows its activity: three members of "Harmony" took part in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release, a copy of "Live 1974" was made that was written in the band's best time.
They were already very famous in foreign countries at the time.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of them its box, its cables and above all its buttons.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking from the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Everyone contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock fans was the fact that the Harmonia band would once again make music.
What we have to rebel here is this: the questions have accurately shown that the name of the band retumba in people’s minds, but it wasn’t so special that after 32 years the public would miss it so much.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the misunderstanding Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to members of Cologne's band Can 2003 for their life's work, the room could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths with astonishment.
Later Michael Rother spent time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and at that time I did not achieve a great effect in the public, however, it got it later thanks to the others.
Some time ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the Berliner Schaubuehne basement.
Later, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a time, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist on the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band which at the time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians from Cluster in exile at Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
It was a life of an artist full of surprises.
As they say, one day a flag of Ottenstein's Harmonia singing association appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in using the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn’t just about getting to know yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that, in this recording almost 50 people participated.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do rehearsals from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against the customs.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up getting into esoteric themes and secured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since had more success than Harmony had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that is to be thanked by Groenemeyer.
His music company Greenland set out to cultivate this own German contribution to preserve it as live music.
Like the work of Roedelius, the band Neu! was once again discovered.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all of Krautrock's influences on the following pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno’s phrase, accompanied by special music, fills the room: “This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future.”
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The story of the development of the legend is shown in black and white photo projections, where instruments with cables are seen.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and the battery in order to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Nowadays, electronic music is just as it should be.
Three people who delve into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of B<0xC3><0xA1>rbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere it is coughing, whispering and in a good moment of emphasis it is singing "Aaaaaaaah!"
Krautrock was always a term of English origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Those who here shout "68!" are also right, but now Harmony keeps calm.
On the stage it is reflected very well on what is already evident.
Where does music start and where does it end?
That can break one’s nerves or give one a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But the two did not have much conviction.
Either the concepts are set a lot in action and shooting or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, are still hiding in the Balkan Mountains, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, actor Richard Gere was rediscovered.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and unimportant roles in women’s films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why do movie titles have to be so long and shot?).
The film has a wonderful presentation to the eye: in the background, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life had already passed, who as a monument to the ruin of his decadence has now been preserved.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be only a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a few words: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acting very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with it.
The meaning of the film is lost to actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a state of war.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" one can investigate, because in reality there was never a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and another scriptwriter (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story of American reporters in the war going to detect a war criminal Serb called "Zorro", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something the army can’t do and every time it turns out to be a crazy journey.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first we are introduced to Simon Hunt, who is not left to be simply a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also envisions a love affair with a Muslim Bosnia that will kill later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is far from the reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with impressive speed achieve what they could not achieve for five years by NATO, the CIA and all the world's headhunters, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians just one way to go.
It is so bad, that they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still free, and highlights that Americans and French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so a very famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, how hard it is to be evil."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they prove how hard it is to be good.
The problem lies not only in the genre of war films in the Balkans.
He recently published in a newspaper that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
There’s almost always a rule: when a star goes through a crisis region or through the minefields, then something like “Rangoon” appears with Patricia Arguette, “On the other side of all borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Bloody Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood rolls a good film about the Holocaust by taking as an example the film "Schindler's List".
Classics such as the Vietnam War works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not celebrated unanimously as masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that’s because scriptwriters don’t have the slightest fix (which is necessary to be able) in telling good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" turned out so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know that the Nazi regime was actually so bad.
Maybe you shouldn’t be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant gaze of an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's only because some things never change."
The great cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed and in Yugoslavia will always rule the war.
Von Beust receives in response negative criticism about the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received a lot of criticism from politics and the economy for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic in estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, general manager of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said Wednesday this resignation was "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the big city has fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
“Without this goal, political, sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level.”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "that refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg’s ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for the Olympic Games, but is decided by the German Olympic Sports Federation," says von Beust at WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the Sportbund decision expected in early December on Munich's request for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
“This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we would have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will have no chance.”
In spite of everything, this dream didn’t end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to let the opportunity go, if at this point the plans are ruined," said G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Plo<0xC3><0x9F>, HSB's director.
A waiver of the application is contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate that he made at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Federation of Sports of the Higher Schools (ADH).
There von Beust designated Hamburg's request for universities in 2015 not as a "substitution" of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Federation of Sports of the Higher Schools appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social Democratic Party (SPD-B<0xC3><0xBC>rgerschaftsfraktion) blamed the Senate for not taking advantage of such valuable time for building houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate delayed the development of the small district of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, MPs for the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required integrated planning of Olympia for little Grasbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU emphasized the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg’s request for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
They are not wooden boxes.
He who relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" gloss-boxes on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" also raised doubts about the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes from 1968 by Andy Warhol, the Museum Moderna Museet in Stockholm conducted internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which are the former director of the museum, are the "Brillo-Boxes", and the former director of the museum "Mull<0xC3><0xB3>t", are the "Mull<0xC3><0xB3>o" in the mull<0xC3><0xB3>.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Glass-Boxes" in New York, painted the wooden boxes red, blue and white, with the same sample that they had "Glass" soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his 1968 works at the Museum Moderna Museet there were exposed hundreds of cardboard boxes. These were not made by Warhol (due to expenses), but were brought directly from the "Grill" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but examples (which were only objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden some wooden glints, but they were not exhibited at the Modern Museum.
Witnesses at the time now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Stockholm-type" "Glass-Boxes" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auctions some of them were purchased for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous museum director Pontus Hultén made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden they were produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But actually, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had already died three years ago.
Lars Bystr<0xC3><0xB6>m, the head of the Moderna Museet Museum’s curators, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. They were first printed and ground their pressed silvers and then painted to oil with brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the pressed silvers. In addition, it is not oil painting, but acrylic painting.
“These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol’s official Brilliant Boxing list,” says Lars Nittve, the director of the Museum Moderna Museet and adds that if the “Andy Warhol Art” Authentication Commission in New York does not arrive at any conclusion, the Museum Moderna Museums will be exposing these boxes.
Already in July the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious allegations" that they are soap dust boxes.
But from that moment everything remained in absolute silence.
Rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers who had entrenched in a hotel in Manila have surrendered and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter he could not answer for spilling blood.
Soldiers loyal to the government had assaulted the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been entrenched in the building for hours.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, were on trial Thursday for attempting a coup d'état in 2003 that ended in a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to suddenly be able to deposit with about 30 supporters.
Obviously the military police officers who were supposed to watch him had passed to their ranks and followed their mutiny.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The president called an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Advisor, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
“People are fed up,” Trillanes said.
"We call on people to move to our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously led the elite Scout Reangers troops, said that within a short time the other military troops wanted to continue the march.
The big government critics called for a big demonstration against the president on Thursday.
For months his government has been blamed for corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention for the mutiny that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempted coups against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be Versatel’s largest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company’s absorption.
There are also options to further increase the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
On Wednesday, they already made assumptions about entering the business, after the Brendenberg bank increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market that means that the financial institution maintains the equity securities for a third partner.
United Internet already the day before made participation with nearly 10 percent to the telecommunications company Drillisch.
Drillisch in the capital expansion measure placed 17.4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares of them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies started negotiations on DSL-products marketing co-operations.
“We’re strengthening our collaboration,” said a United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies founded a company together with MSP, to acquire the competitor Freenet.
United Internet reported that at the start, the two companies want to be happy with the participation of ten percent to Freenet and do not make use of their right, i.e. they make participation to 18.49 percent of Freenet.
This meant that both companies maintained all options, especially participation in the anonymous Freenet company.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This “game” with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German market of Telecom.
At the end of the third quarter Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
So far, the holdings of United Internet and Drillisch directly had 6.01 percent of the stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
