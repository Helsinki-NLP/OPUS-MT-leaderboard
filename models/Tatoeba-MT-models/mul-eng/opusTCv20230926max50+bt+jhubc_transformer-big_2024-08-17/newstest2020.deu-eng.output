Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen was extinguished. This was reported by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire had broken out on Thursday night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire brigade was in the wreckage with around 200 people.
The fire could have been extinguished.
Anrainers were called not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, additives for lubricants are produced. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of the US-Briefs and the US-Briefs
About 400 people work in the plant. The chemical factory has already provided for headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 the gas methanethiol escaped through a leak and the surrounding environment smelled far after rotten eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city’s wastewater system.
Woman announces job to search for 57 days for her missing dog
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and announced her job for extra. The seven-year-old Border Collie had been removed from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days was missing from the dog every trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was horrible. I got mean," Carole King told "Daily Inter Lake." She and her husband had left the dog Katie in the hotel room while they were going to dinner. After returning to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had put the dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere else in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four, four and a half hours ago", Carole King remembers towards "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door has opened, Katie is ready to leave immediately.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But from days were weeks. “I never gave up. I never lost hope,” said Carole King to “Daily Inter Lake,” who announced her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Kate's disappearance, Carole King got a call. A man reported to me and said that she had found herself in his yard. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared again. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly her dog stood under a tree. "I didn't want to hug her.
Losses in the Bundeswehr: machine guns disappear unscathed
Friday, 27. September 2019
Six machine guns of the type MG3 are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. The remains are unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "terrifying" extent.
In the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition are disappearing again and again - many of them so far without a trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons parts and almost 20,000 ammunition. This is evidenced by a list of the German defense ministry classified as a closed case.
According to the paper from the office of Secretary of Defense Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one gun part and 3474 ammunition have so far appeared. The weapons and weapon parts that are still missing are, among other things, two types of machine guns of type MG3, four types of rifles of type MG3, four types of rifles of type MG3 and four types of rifles.
The extent of weapons and ammunition losses at the Bundeswehr was "terrifying", said the left-wing Bundestag deputy Martina Renner. This is all the more true, since in the course of investigations there was hardly anything found. The left-wing politician also spoke of a "possible balance of the race".
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves Iranian port
More than two months after its capture by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker set in motion and left the Iranian port of Raqqa.
The tanker had already been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it initially remained in Iranian waters, and the shipping company said it wanted to wait for an official announcement from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" had been charged on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on charges of violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was thus on the controversial, temporary determination of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the British-responsive Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the most important sea lanes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the seas. Tensions in the region have increased tremendously in recent months. The U.S. trade shipping has become increasingly tense with the Gulf of Iran and the conflict between the United States and the Gulf of Iran.
Merkel praises the courage of people in the peaceful revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has appreciated the commitment of the people in the GDR, who took to the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, brave citizens would have shaken up the GDR regime at that time, Merkel said during a feast of the Thuringian CDU faction became the first candidate of the German Communist Party.
Musk set a record for delivery
Tesla’s quarter may hold a record. Despite a boom in deliveries, there have been recent losses in the electric car group.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock market. "We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail from the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk’s circulars said. The challenge is to bring the cars to the customer quickly. To do this, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of business with an increase of over six percent. So strong has not added to the price for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well over 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be produced in the current and coming quarter year. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom there was.
Mystery Solved: That's Why We Can't Quit Ourselves
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from being able to tickle themselves. Scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found this with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. There have also been advances in the question of why children are so fiercely against the kit.
Finally, it has also been shown why only the closeness of a tickling hand caused laughter even before the touch. This lay on a deep layer in the large brain, which caused laughter already while waiting for the tickling.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats with "smiling" in the ultrasound range respond when they are bitten by humans. This "smiling" is mediated by the part of the large intestine, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-touching
Until now, it has been assumed that the brain can be different between self-touching and touch by others - that is why people can not self-chitze. The Berlin researchers now found in the experiments on the rats that laughter is the same as the activity of the affected area of the large brain during a hive.
But if you pass the self-touch and the touch by others at the same time, the laughter is also suppressed. This suggests that the rat’s brain cannot distinguish between the self-touch and the touch by others. The new findings put close to the active brain that people can’t shake themselves, shake them.
The rats have also been trained to tickle themselves. In this way, they discontinued this initiation in the experiment, therefore, sometimes prematurely, showed escape behavior or scarecrow. This ambivalence is the same as the children's behavior. The ambivalence of the tickling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster averted: Great fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen was extinguished, which was reported by the Normandy prefecture of the AFP news agency on Friday, and the fire broke out on Thursday night.
According to authorities, no hazardous substances have been released. The samples taken do not give any reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in the wreckage with around 200.
Schools and Kindergarten closed
Residents were urged not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
Factory owned by U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett’s Lubrizol company
In the chemical plant on the banks of the Seine, lubricant additives are manufactured. The factory is owned by U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett’s Lubrizol company and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly strict safety regulations. The plant employs around 400 people.
The chemical factory has already in the past provided headlines - for example, when in 2013 the gas methanethiol escaped through a leak and the environment largely tainted by foul eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, around 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city’s wastewater system.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first session of Parliament after the suspension of the mandatory break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister is threatening to lead the country on October 31 without an agreement from the EU, but should Brussels not accept his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, how he wants to achieve this, he wants to achieve that.
Speaking about Cox, who had campaigned for Britain’s stay in the European Union, the prime minister said: “The best way to honor Jo Cox’s memory and reunite this country would be to complete the EU exit.” Cox was assassinated by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Commemoration of Oslo and Ut<0xC3><0xB6>ya attacks revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Ut<0xC3><0xB6>ya with 77 dead, a memorial will be unveiled on Saturday in Norway in honour of the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of around 1,000 iron roses, reminiscent of the roses in the valleys of Osmen and the valleys of Osmen.
At the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will now be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims.
On 22 July 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first set off a car bomb in the Oslo government district and then dozens of participants of a youth organization camp on the island of Ut<0xC3><0xB6>ya, killing 77 people.
Iran Releases British Tanks
The UN general debate did not bring a solution in the Iran conflict, but now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran was able to plunge into the sea again. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker Stena Impero, which has been stuck in the Strait of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters, after being released by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk reported.
The "Stena Impero" have left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew are now driving for medical examinations to Dubai, said Reederef Erik H<0xC3><0xA5>nell. By noon the ship had left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he told Swedish TV.
"This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had arrested the tanker on 19 July on charges of violating the regulations of maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well with their circumstances, H<0xC3><0xA5>nell said.
The British government suspected a response to a similar incident in British Gibraltar following the establishment of the "Stena Impero": there, at the beginning of July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, destined for Syria, was put on the chain.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Bravery measures, it was a trade deal to free the "Stena Impero", London vehemently showed back.
The Strait of Hormus is one of the most important sea lanes in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the seas. Tensions in the region have increased dramatically in recent months. The US and the Gulf of Iran have become increasingly tense.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse Iran of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran denies that. The United States was left alone in 2018 from the international nuclear agreement, which would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time destroy its political and economic power.
Due to the dispute over the “Stena Impero” and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of merchant ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Straits of Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protection forces for the security of the Gulf.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
In the face of the sanctions imposed by President Donald Trump of America against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to reposition themselves in the People's Republic of China. The financial leaders of Asian companies consider their products
But now India itself has become Trump’s focus. From Haudegen in the White House denominated as the “Kingdom of Customs”, America has removed the trade preferences for 2000 products from the emerging countries at the beginning of June. The US is prohibitively visiting India high tariffs and demanding better motor vehicle access, mopeds, mopeds for more.
On the world map of trade wars, the frictions with India are clearly just a sideshow. In addition, America considers the world's largest democracy also through the security glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China's claims of power in the South Indian Ocean.
The problem, however, lies in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development, has a difficult situation in the socialist republic of India. Also under Modi. Its reformer is mainly focused on the bureaucratic madness, which in the multi-ethnic state has been gaining profits for a long time
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, much has turned out to be better in India in the first five years of Modi. However, this does not apply in trade policy. This means that new, internationally uncompetitive companies will be able to compete with foreign suppliers.
In the West, Modi is addicted to the nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country. This impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic prime minister only knows too well which vocabulary Western managers like. At the core, the virtuoso became an "India First" lawyer, but never defended by a lawyer
The inauguration of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac is scheduled to be added to Paris next week, according to a report. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the cemetery of Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, according to a report by the AFP news agency.
Bringing competitors to the finish line: Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championships
The world’s highest peak was not reached long ago, while the world’s highest peak was at the foot of the hill, where there was a warm-hearted scene at the Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba started to swing dangerously. He could hardly stay on his feet until the goal was reached.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," said Dabo, after the race in the Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly drew the attention of the assembled journalists. Shyness he had left first, wanted not to talk about his heroism at all, wanted to talk to him as usual.
He did this with repressiveness in the evening - and much more intense than he would have thought. For this heroism will remain in memory. For Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the finish line and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, the end of the endgame was not spent in the endgame with all this five minutes after the <0xC3><0x89>thiop<0xC3><0xA8>re.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, went to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha, although according to official data with 18:10.87 minutes, he himself was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was only running all day".
Millions of Masses: Egypt Prepares for Wild Day of Protest
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in advance of possible government-critical protests. In central Cairo on Friday there was an increased police presence. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked.
In the past few days, police have stepped up their street checks and pedestrians’ phones have been partially searched for messages and photos related to the protests, and hundreds have been arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
In the past weekend, there have been protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. In the past years, there have been protests in Egypt, and in the past, there have been no protests in Egypt.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests did not increase, according to two groups of observers. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported more
Arbitrary arrests
Many people have been "involuntarily arrested", "just because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time'", HRW told detainees on appeal to lawyers. The allegations against the detainees range according to their lawyers from "distribution of false information" to "distribution of false information", to "discrimination in prison", to "discrimination in prison".
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country, which means the government is blocking websites and online services in Cairo to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online Dealers: Senders should be able to donate returns more easily
For online traders, many returned packages are lost goods. Around 20 million returns land on the trash. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While the companies could not be exempt from the sales tax on donations, the ministry explained on a question from the Green Bundestag Group, which the newspapers of the Funke media group reported on Friday, but the traders could not pay the market value of the unsold returns to such a low level that they do not pay the lowest amount of sales.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had determined that the federal citizens would return every sixth package when ordering online. Around four percent of the goods – about 20 million products – then landed in the trash. They would be donated to companies after the current legal situation would cost additional money, because the financial authorities then revalued the amount.
Green group leader Katrin G<0xC3><0xB6>ring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a ruling that companies can evaluate non-sales products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. Companies should be able to rely on the model not only to be punished for donating online.
Banksy art at auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
Streetart-Star Banksy's famous work, "Devolved Parliament", is to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work "emphasizes the restoration of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world to the basic attitude of animals and tribes". From Saturday the painting is to be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the south-west of the UK, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion the work, which was "Parliament" in the former "Question Hour", was re-released.
The image could change the owner for a million dollars.
At the first meeting of the House of Commons on Wednesday following the lifting of an impeachment by the Supreme Court, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had delivered a hard-fought exchange with the opposition, and Johnson wants to carry out the already twice-displaced Brexit on October 31, if necessary, even without an agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered with the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted an image depicting a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a knife. The work sees thousands of truck drivers visiting and visiting others every day.
Brexit debate is like a “walk in the park”
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s fierce verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred in his top adviser’s opinion. Compared to the election campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a “space walk in the park”, EU’s position will be “said on Friday.
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in parliament hard in recent days and accused them of, among other things, "betrayal" on the people, accusing them of endangering MPs because they could become a target of murder threats, he dismissed as "humbug".
Cummings said the only way to rest again was if MPs would finally respect the British decision to leave the EU, and it was not surprising that people were appalled that Britain was still not leaving the EU three years after the referendum.
In the face of the charged mood on Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint. "We should speak with respect to each other," it said in a statement. "And we should listen as well."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for U.N. intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in its first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan told the U.N. General Debate in New York on Friday. "If this goes wrong, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst". The United Nations should have a responsibility for Kashmir.
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers each control part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. At the beginning of August, India had the Kashmir region schism in the Autonomous State of Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
Protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Over the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with hard hand. It shoots with sharp ammunition at the population, over 2,000 prisoners are imprisoned in the Arab prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting time was never done by the general in 2013.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of perspective and the feeling of being suffocated by their own government drove millions onto the streets. And this is a problem that even the regime of el-Sisi does not get hold of, no matter how hard it is to resist.
Today, every third person is living in poverty. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the rate of inflation is ten percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The last one is not
T<0xC3><0xBC>v tests in the terminal: BER boss: no more "showstoppers" for capital airports
For two months, it was checked whether the complex plant interface works in the BER fire protection interplay. The operators are satisfied with the course. However, the hose is not yet finished at the BER.
After extensive tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year, which is for sure, said Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the Control Board.
Airport manager Engelbert L<0xC3><0xBC>tke Daldrup spoke of a successful completed test, but also said that there are still shortcomings to be addressed in the terminal. "We have many details, but we do not have a real showstopper". He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contained buffers.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction completion announcement is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year this was planned for this fall.
Hundreds of defects in power cables have yet to be fixed; the pipeline wants to check them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the inclusion of the flight operation, intensive work must continue on the processing of defects," it said in a written communication.
L<0xC3><0xBC>tke Daldrup said that in many cases there is lack of evidence, less of new cables. There is also no release for all duvets on which the cable tracks hang. The airport manager expects these to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal is still not working satisfactorily. The problems had led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is smoke shorts that are going down in case of a fire like a canvas, so that the smoke does not have to spread with new ones.
Problems with fire protection and other building defects as well as planning defects have been delaying the airport's opening for years. It was originally due to go into operation in 2011 and the cost has increased from two billion since the start of construction in 2006 to an expected opening of around 6.5 billion euros next year.
As the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the managers plan to expand the airport, which is why it is planned to go to a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on October 18, as President Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new CEOs. Finance chief Heike F<0xC3><0xB6>lster will switch to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, HR chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked F<0xC3><0xB6>lster. She set the airport finances on a firm foot.
Chemnitz: Machines blasted for drugs - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and chased several machines into the air in the Chemnitz city area! Now the perpetrator is finally in jail!
Over the past two years, the number of cigarettes and parking machines exploded in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply, resulting in millions of damage!
The police captured a 33-year-old German after two detonations at the end of May on the B<0xC3><0xBC>rgerstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and at the Furtherstra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations into the conduct of explosive explosions in Tate unit with a particularly serious case of theft conducted by the Chemnitz Criminal Police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "With the loot, he apparently financed his addiction to narcotics", the bomber had exploded four times between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019 parking machines on the B<0xC3><0xBC>rgerstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60 000 euros!
The auto-bomber is now in custody, and police investigations are continuing against him.
It is possible that he was also responsible for further automatic jumps in Chemnitz and adjacent counties.
AUA takes on Eurowings flights from Vienna
In the midst of the price competition with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed on Friday.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa Eurowings ticket flyer is thus de facto dissolved. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft in Germany, four remain in Vienna. This will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In Salzburg, three Eurowings will be transferred to the Eurowings and the so-Jets will be transferred to Salzburg in the future.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesman explained. The flight times are to be tailored to connecting flights. The aim is, on the one hand, to strengthen the hub Vienna and, on the other hand, to increase decentralised traffic from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna will only serve as a "Production Company" in the group sister company AUA. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be served with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. The onboard product should not be adapted to the date of EuroFlugen, but should be adapted to the date of EuroFlugen.
At the airport of Vienna, a price battle broke out after the Niki-Pleite. The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion only announced on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna next summer will be on 16 aircraft. The Irish low-cost airliner will send four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, as well as the crews, in the same way.
Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary’s campaign statement that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years’ time, contradicted AUA CEO Andreas Otto on Friday: “We remain number one on the site, in five, six or ten years.”
Queen-Enkelin Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were best friends. Now the last of the four is married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) is supposed to have stopped at the hand of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31), which the palace announced on Thursday.
“We’re extremely excited to announce our engagement, and we’re both so excited to start this adventure together and can’t wait to actually be married,” the couple, who have been together since October 2018, said in an official statement.
“We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the coming years of love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie clipped the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also immediately posted on her Instagram account.
A Royal Festival
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information on the date, place and everything else will be announced in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the softening of the number nine of the British succession and the real estate mogul will be a similar big feast as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on the Causes of Heart Diseases
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to take a closer look at the heritage of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the heritage of 9,000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to trace the causes of cardiovascular disease in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) said on Friday. The K<0xC3><0xBC>hne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. The Swiss high mountain clinic Davos, which is part of the foundation, and the University Hospital is located in Z<0xC3><0xBC>rlichspi.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diets are among the most important influenceable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only known to be insufficient, said the researchers.
Currently, in more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - are known, the clinic said.
According to the initiators, the aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the research of other diseases of the people, according to Stefan Blankenberg and Head of the University of Herzzen.
The chairman of the K<0xC3><0xBC>hne-Stiftung, Klaus-Michael K<0xC3><0xBC>hne (82), also emphasized that there is a strong desire to use the data also for the research of other diseases. The clinic of the foundation in Davos is currently mainly treating allergies.
The biosamples of the healthy participants come from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is by far the largest local health study in the world. In the case of inheritance encryption, the protection of anonymous data is strictly adhered to.
According to UKE, a person’s heritage can now be deciphered within 24 hours. The net cost of doing so is 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is due to start on October 1, 2020 and is expected to reach 9000 per year.
Nigerian Police Release Hundreds of Abused Boys
In Nigeria, the police have released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to information from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims were partially still minors, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo told them.
The boys had been arrested under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. In fact, the patrons of their teachers had been detained under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children aged nine years old, had been arrested in a raum.
The Koran school has been in existence for about ten years, according to the data. Residents had paid attention to repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents had been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school, said Sabo. They had been harassed by the suffering of their children and had not been harassed by the police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often deficient state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee relief agency, therefore, in the last ten months, more than 40,000 people have fled to Grenat over the past nine months.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police release 400 children from school
Police officers have freed nearly 400 students in a school in northern Nigeria from horrific conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said in the town of Kaduna.
The children had been discovered there on Thursday after a reference in an Islamic school. The conditions there had been "inhumane". The officials arrested the school principal and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were kept in their school like slaves and chained to chains. Some were sexually abused. Television footage showed battered and injured students in a markedly poor state of health.
World football election: Further allegations against Messis and Klopps K<0xC3><0xBC>r
Football "Signature not valid"
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Cup is the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honour and thus a record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted in the World Cup, accusations against FIFA come from other countries. Egypt was not valued at all - with a curious justification.
In recent years, much of FIFA has proved to be a ruse: the World Cup awards, dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Cup election has so far failed to convince the Nationals to step away from it, and the National
However, after having already complained about Nicaragua’s captain, he did not vote at all, other grievances are now coming to light: Egypt complained that the voices of national coach Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account.
The FIFA apologises in so far as "the signatures on the election forms were issued in capital letters and therefore not valid", and the Egyptian association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without reply.
Sudan's coach was also surprised.
Even from Sudan, there is an outcry about the election. While the situation in Egypt is comprehensible, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was rated at the end: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in second and Sadiouf in third place.
Juan Barrera, Nicaragua’s captain, said: “I did not vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information on my vote is wrong, thank you,” he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted in his name.
Henry's message came from the association on Friday: "Yes, but of course there was no intention. The completed election documents were "irresponsible" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, said in a message of the association.
The other cases are now being examined by FIFA in an investigation, but stressing that the election process has been supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Football Election - and J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: high-ranking Republicans speak out for official inquiry
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly spoken out for an official investigation into the U.S. president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Wherever the investigation is going, the facts are more determined than what is going to happen."
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
Republicans have so far resisted criticism of Trump over the Whistleblower affair, only a few have been able to recognize dissatisfaction with it. Scott’s statements are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party. In the process, the moderate governor of Virginia had already turned against Trump’s policies several times, and had already turned against Trump’s policies, such as defamation.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. “It’s a deeply disturbing situation,” Baker said. “The right course of action and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and get her to the bottom of it.”
Scott and Baker, as the governor of the U.S. states, have not formally entered into any consultation in the proceedings against Trump, which is decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore above all symbolically important. However, even the first senators of the Republicans have expressed criticism of the situation.
The affair could lead to the introduction of a process of ouster against Trump, which the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into, and they accuse him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment process. With its majority in the House of Representatives, Democrats could seek so-called impeachment. However, the decision about an actual impeachment fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for the success of such a procedure have been raised in the U.S.
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had illegally piloted the port of Lampedusa on board the rescue ship Sea Watch 3 and 53 Libyan refugees, according to fierce protests and international criticism, and her Austrian president, Alexander van der Bellen, was once again the head of the Austrian parliament.
Now, new serious charges against Rackete are being made, so three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could not have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. Suspects have been caught in a detention camp in Messina (Sicily).
It was reported by police in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had been raped, tortured and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and tortured by the migrants and were repeatedly harassed by them.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they can’t know exactly who gets on the ships. “We can’t scan who the people are. They come without passports,” said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It’s going to be very likely that the
Italy’s right-wing former interior minister Matteo Salvini immediately apologized to Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk aims for Tesla's record-breaking delivery
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost to the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
“We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk’s circulars said. The challenge is to bring the cars to the customer quickly. To do this, Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of business with an increase of over six percent. So strong has not added to the price for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be generated in the current and coming quarter year. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the payloads are low. Despite the boom there was.
U.S. Budget Struggle: Just One Bridge Financing Again
The new fiscal year will begin in the U.S. on October 1 without a proper budget. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on transitional funding until November 21.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in spending ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 budgets, the United States will once again be there before the new fiscal year begins on October 1, with no spending plans. The Senate has passed a bill on Thursday to the House of Representatives.
Shutdown Cancelled
The Federal Administration is now provisionally funded at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the 2019 financial year ending on Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws that the various departments and authorities cannot allocate to the new budget.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate also has ten of the twelve spending plans that are more or less viable.
The ghosts are already separating mainly on the topic of resource allocation for the field of homeland security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the wall building, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The Democrats have been disturbing the wall building plans and the military of the building itself.
The ghosts are separated from the wall building
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than agreeing on all 12 spending laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transition funding beyond November 21st. A shutdown is also then not excluded.
Against the background of the Congress's continuing inability to agree on the twelve spending laws in good time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas to automate the process of popularity are gaining in the background.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is also expected to be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government bill, according to which all women can use in vitro fertilization to increase the demand for anonymous sperm donation.
The proposal still needs the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that in the future, numerous "children without a father" could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agn<0xC3><0xA8>s Buzyn defended as an "opportunity" for society. It represents the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her conception, the costs of artificial conception are to be borne by all women.
Fertility with sperm from dead husband further prohibited
By a narrow majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment that would give widows access to the sperm of their dead man. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial fertilization is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there was a dispute over the past of the Parisian woman,
Many members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic in Motion, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had, on the other hand, expressed themselves for the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner.
The initiators of the now-failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be fertilized in the future with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization in France is only allowed for heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that breastfeeding remains prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - it is still often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Compensation for climate: calls for air tickets for Unis are getting louder
A lot is being flown to the universities, which is why the country wants to have a climate tax in the future. The principals say they don’t have any money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also limit themselves to flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The discussion about the climate change on flights from universities and universities, which was postponed until the end of the summer break, has begun to resume. After the conference of the National Rectors of the Netherlands had skeptically responded to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities.
Russia is once again catching North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB intelligence service, the detainees are said to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were already arrested. At that time, there was a shootout between the border guards and the boat crew. The three Russians and one North Korean were injured, but the fishermen were not injured.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way in Russian high seas. There, the Coast Guard of Russia drives patrols according to their own information to protect their marine biological resources.
30,000 Inkfish confiscated
During the re-checks, 30,000 inkfishes were discovered and seized on the boats, and data were seized on three fishing and two motor boats and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
According to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been detained there for some time this year, according to the Russian fishing authority, according to complaints from local businessmen this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the far-eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with dense synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would also be used to make small mermaids and mermaids out of the wild.
In the future, only 18,000 remain: U.S. lowers asylum ceiling
The “most generous nation in history”: Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country on earth is facing protection seekers: as the State Department in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal influx of refugees will be further lowered, and in the future, above all, threatened believers and Iraqi asylum will be granted.
The U.S. government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the admission of new refugees once again. In the 2020 fiscal year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, a maximum of 18,000 people are to be left in the country, as the U.S. Department of State declared.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically lowered the reception readiness for asylum seekers from all over the world in recent years, with far higher reception limits under the previous administration of Barack Obama.
The projected upper limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980. However, the U.S. Department of State called the U.S. "the most compassionate and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly supported the language usage of the incumbent U.S.P.
A “responsible handling” of refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets a lot of opposition from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to block. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency. Whether there is a temporal link between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is possible at the time of the Trump stand-off is unclear.
The U.S. government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith – and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and thereby are in danger, as stated by the Foreign Ministry, according to the Guardian.
The U.S. wants to achieve that, in particular, people from this "northern triangle" of Central America are applying for asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has only concluded with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements in order to immigrate to the U.S. southern border to Mexico.
Court orders release of Orang-Utan from zoo
An orang-utan girl has been transferred from the former zoo of Buenos Aires to a detention center for human monkeys in the United States at the request of the Argentinian justice. The "Sandra" born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986 was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so her release was not forced to do so.
Since the 53-kilogram-heavy human monkey is not able to adapt to life in the wild, it is expected to live in the free-range of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", quaranne must be a cub in the former pet of Michael Jackson.
After her birth in Rostock, Sandra spent a few years at the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 animal rights trial for Sandra has helped to make the Zoo of Buenos Aires a green park.
Record for Swiss extreme mountain climbers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
Dani Arnold, the extreme mountain climber, has managed a new Hussar ride on the almost 3000-meter-high Great Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double floor or other means, the Swiss captured the 550-meter-high northern wall of the Great Wall in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, T-shirts and only supported by absolute freedom of swindle, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds to climb, thus subjugating the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
The U.S. sports goods manufacturer Nike has directly booked a significant profit increase in spite of the trade conflict with China. The net profit directly increased to 1.4 billion dollars in the last quarter (nearly 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year's online market, as the Group is ahead of all the service
Sales rose to $10.7 billion over the three-month period until the end of August. Nike sales rose by 22 percent in China, benefiting Beaverton, Oregon, from its approach to mobile phones, mobile phones, and mobile phones.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that with strategic investments, Nike will continue to drive the "digital transformation" of the sporting goods manufacturer and thus expand its competitive advantage. The investors responded pleased with the quarterly figures - the shares of the sporting goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Life-long stadium ban for racism in Italy
As a result of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Roma, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong ban on a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil had been mocked by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked him to join his club
The club responded late Thursday. He reported the fan’s account to Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma supporters are never allowed to visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. The Italian fans regularly scandalize racist abuses against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and that is very serious about the identity of the players.
However, there had been discussions about the supporters of Juventus Turin for years, too. The Italian authorities now have 38 randalizing fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years.
Fans are linked to ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra-fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused of serious blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigation with an announcement last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-leaders are supposed to put tickets behind the black trade, have "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve, and are said to have blackmailed Juventus employees to come up with cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole vintages are thought of with catchy designations. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the particular life feelings of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" On September 21, the crab catch officially started at Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, which also introduced the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Public Works Department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.

Iran-U.S. conflict: Ruhani talks about end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani has spoken after his return from the UN General Assembly about an alleged U.S. offer to lift sanctions, and the United States, in return for talks with the Tehran leadership, had put an end to all sanctions, Ruhani said on his website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted Iranian official on Twitter: “Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed against him so there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no.”
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and would have pushed for a meeting to take place. "And the Americans say, I am lifting the sanctions, they should have added to the manner in which it was done."
However, if this advance did not take place in an acceptable manner, Ruhani criticized. In view of the current criminal measures and the "poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear deal with Iran with Russia and China. This is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. Rufierting France President Emmanuel Macron had at the UN Council
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Almost 200 aftershocks
After Western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within a short period of time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people have been injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake on the previous day, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged as a result. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake shook the Marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the million-strong metropolis. Now the government wants to deploy a commission to prepare the country for the future.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, badly built residential buildings collapse – among other things, made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly occur in Istanbul.
City planners such as the well-known architect M<0xC3><0xBC>cella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas, which were registered in the center as a refuge, have long been built. It was only on the 20th anniversary of the G<0xC3><0xB6>lc<0xC3><0xBC>k earthquake in August that the Istanbul Chamber of Civil Engineers had warned that an estimated one million buildings were not built in Istanbul.
The epicenter of Thursday’s quake was in the Marmara Sea in front of the Silivri district and at a depth of about seven kilometers, as the disaster protection agency Afad reported. A smaller aftershock caused even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said on Twitter that injuries or damage had not been reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings in the Silivri district for security reasons. Some students were crying as on pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly at risk of earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian globe. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the earthquake in 1999 around 17 times more than people in Istanbul.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. The earthquake on Thursday already hit the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags packed with everything they need to get ready next door, and schools are bringing kids how to behave when the earth is shaking. When the next big quake comes, it’s unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered minor damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom). According to his two sources, Mosheer and Mosheer, the mayor of Istanbul Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom).
Warning for aftershocks in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Buildings bulging. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It was more violent than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned people on Twitter to get rid of them.
According to official information, the time of the quake is 13.59 am (local time) and just minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a subsequent quake, which was reported with a magnitude of 4.0 on the judges' scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of magnitude 4.6 shook the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the millionth metropolis, the disaster protection authority Afad reported on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that caused headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually decompose - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher S<0xC3><0xBC>kr<0xC3><0xBC> Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he told CNN Turkey. "These could be the signs of a bigger earthquake," Ersoy told the broadcaster. "Earlier or later, the big earthquake will also come."
Already a few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake caused great concern in Istanbul too. In Albania there had also been a severe earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 people injured. Also on Lake Constance this year.
Parliament: New fuel in Ukraine affair

USA: United Airlines flyer locked in toilet - flyer diverted
Because a passenger was trapped in the board toilet, a flight was diverted by United Airlines. The toilet door had been blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, according to U.S. media.
In the case of an unplanned landing on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally able to be released from the narrow cabin. About an hour after she was locked in it, U.S. media wrote calling on other passengers. To continue in the direction of San Francisco, the passengers had to change their machines.
In a video posted on the Internet, which is supposed to come from Flight 1554, according to US media, is seen as several people trying to free the woman. "We're working right now to open the door, Ma'am. We're going to get you out, okay?" says a man.
Kakerlake: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it – and his protagonist is unrecognizable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation", the British successful author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will not be published in German on November 27, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) shared. This is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who in his past life has been ignored or hated by Will as the most powerful
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If the parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers are shamelessly lying as once the Soviet leaders, if Brexiteers in high positions were to answer a no-deal, I can only answer a question in a letter
Kafka's first published 1915 story is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "turning into an enormous ignominy", is gradually ruled out by family and society, and eventually falls into disrepair. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka, to describe a world steeped by the head.

Thomas Cook: All trips cancelled until October 31st
German travel organiser Thomas Cook has cancelled all travel until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency application. Travel could not be "approached for insolvency reasons", the company said on Thursday evening.
These include bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>GER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which have already been paid or fully paid. As is the case with travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company has left open.
Thomas Cook, in Germany, was involved in the litigation of the British parent company and filed for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, <0xC3><0x96>ger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to send money back to hotels from now on
On the other hand, from this Friday hotels abroad, which are still hosting Thomas Cook vacationers, are expected to receive money from the Zurich insurance. Payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that vacationers are no longer required for extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesperson for the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and under the condition that Thomas-Cook-Travelers from these hotels will no longer be able to make individual payments from these hotels.
The insurance responded to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own information, had been forced to pay their accommodation on the spot. Some had therefore to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be matched with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance spokesman said. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook package holidaymakers from Germany were still on their way. Zurich Germany has secured the holiday and return trip of Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
However, the now announced withdrawals to hotels by the Zurich Insurance only help travelers who are currently on the move. For Thomas-Cook customers who just want to fly on vacation, it looks bad. The company already booked late Thursday evening, all trips would be valid until October 31.
As for travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In accordance with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be checked, it said. In principle, the insurance Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and apply their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosives in Angola
Prince Harry continues Lady Diana's commitment for a long time, and in Africa, he is now walking directly in his mother's footsteps.
Dressed in a blue splitter jacket, Prince Harry has set a mine in Angola on fire and destroyed.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust in the town of Dirico, on Friday morning, in front of running TV cameras, he set the fire circle. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the savannah landscape, without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone still has more than 100,000 relics of the past decade.
On the fifth day of his trip to Africa, Harry then wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo on the trail of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same explosive master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to reverse the path she went at the time.
Harry, 35, and his wife Meghan, 38, have been on a 10-day trip to Africa since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The risk of a no-deal remains acute
but Johnson's decision to postpone the Brexit negotiations has been made clear. Johnson's decision to postpone the Brexit negotiations is not guaranteed. But what statements have been made by the polarizing British people for a long time. The recent verdict of the Supreme Court in the UK can be overturned.
Boris Johnson says deal is still possible
But the pressure does not seem to pass on to Johnson either, and in the meantime, when he visited a hospital, he made indications that he would support an extension of the negotiations in the event of a no-deal by the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best of all, with a deal, I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
But time is not running out of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. After six weeks, Johnsons could have given the EU and the British negotiators time to prevent a UK exit from the European Union without a deal. But the recent talks have not reached a breakthrough.
U.S. authorities: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths in the U.S. related to the use of e-cigarettes in the U.S. has increased to 12. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injured in this regard, the U.S. Health Agency reported.
Fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
Millions of times the videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared in online networks. The construction contractor and actor living in Spain is calling for a "people's revolution" in it. For this Friday, he has made further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military calling for a "people's revolution".
The security authorities are in any case alarmed. In the center of Cairo there was already an increased police presence to be observed. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. Already in the past days the police had been hanging on the streets and the police had tightened their photo controls by hand.
On September 20, the protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Just last weekend, protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura were held with hundreds of participants. There had been no such open protests in Egypt for years. The security forces responded accordingly. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) had been detained since 2000
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. According to this, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after he had overthrown the democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Mursi in years of being a blogger and has been a blogger.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday and was welcomed on his arrival in the port of Hamburg by the skipper Boris Herrmann, climate activist Greta Thunberg with the race yacht "Malizia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the effects of global warming on his sailing ship Dagmar Aaen on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar researcher. He waited for years for the young generation to speak. It has been known for decades that the earth is warming. Yet many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place with the exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the filling of the seas. During the expedition, among other things, Greenlandic glacier ice was measured with a drone and netted to micropla.
The polar explorer from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" as part of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us, the survival of the oceans is at our heart, Arved Fuchs is a great role model in Argegen Verhungen", said the skipper of Arver Boris Herrmann.
Expensive Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for pasta 430 Euro
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: This seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill included 80 euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, triggering hot reactions.
“Such cases are damaging to Rome’s reputation, and we urge the police to consider whether this is a fraud,” a spokesman for Federagit, the travel guide’s association in Rome, told the Roman daily Il Messaggero.
Immediately came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, justified the local owner. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. Also a drink money of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with a resignation procedure after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats want to check that with their investigation in the House of Representatives now as soon as possible - the talk would be from weeks until a decision was made.
At the beginning of the scandal, a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky is reportedly due to be made public. The accusation of the whistleblower, who has brought the conversation out of concern for national security and for democracy of the United States with his complaint to the public, has been monstrous to the public, the president has made a mockery of
The core of this project is also to be seen in the co-written text of the conversation with Selenskyj, which is now published, although it does not reflect the full wording, but the July 25 phone call is only an episode of a much larger story, in the center of which Trump stands above all his personal lawyer, Giuliani.

The lawyer and former New York mayor seem to have infected themselves with right-wing conspiracy fantasies set on Trump’s 2016 election counter-candidacy: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics at the time said, to never construct an occasion for the U.S.
The President's version of Giuliani and the President is: The former vice president and currently promising candidates for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, the former president of the United States, the former president of the United States, the former president of the United States, the former president of the United States of America, the former president of the United States of America, the former president of the United States of America, and the current candidate of the United States of the United States.
In fact, the process was somewhat different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. In addition, Shokin himself was accused of deeply corrupt gestures, the U.S. government was opposed to the far-reaching

Polish Scientists Rescued in Antarctica <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Three Polish scientists have been rescued from the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on their way with a hose boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for the mines.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 we received the message, just before ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the tube boat."
Poland has been operating on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists working there.The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Warning: Smartphone DO NOT charge wirelessly
Practical, but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should still not be used.
Since recently several new smartphones have come on the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - above all the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessary.
High Temperature Adds Battery
Researchers warn about the wireless charging of smartphones. This is according to the findings of the University of Warwick that the device is extremely harmful. Due to the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a phone normally by cable, the battery will not heat up to 27 degrees, the battery will not heat up to 27 degrees.
Capacity and Lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a crucial factor. Since every single degree of iPhone plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only absorbs capacity, but it also lasts not so long. The battery lasts for less than a minute, so the battery lasts longer.
Practitioner
The technology is very convenient: Simply put the device on a suitable charging pad - these should be already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and exhaust fumes. Since the standard is used with the Qi (which is used for inductive energy transfer)
Everest-Stau Photographer: 13 Eight Thousand in Six Months
A Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world in just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition organizer said.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 8,000 in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: From him comes a photo of mountaineers who went viral in the spring, standing on Mount Everest snake.
The image of the mass migration sparked a debate about stronger security measures on the 8848-meter-high mountain and highest peaks of the Earth. In May, eleven climbers died in the ascent within a few days.
A problem for Purja could become the ascent of the 14th Eight Thousandth: At present, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is called bad weather among other things. Earlier this week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to talk to China to enable him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four bodies were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists-visited rock fortress Sigiriya. The animals were believed to be between 15 and 25 years old, according to the police spokesman. An autopsy was arranged to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed every year. The perpetrators are often farmers, on whose land the animals had previously remained harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed annually by elephants. This usually happens when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka, and the death penalty is theoretically the death penalty.

Thomas Cook's Management in Criticism

Elon Musk to increase Tesla shares
This was written by Musk in an email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) from the industry blog "Electrek". The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it went on in Musk's circulars.
The challenge is to bring the cars to the customer quickly and Tesla will have to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares went out of business with an increase of over six percent. So strong has not added to the price for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well over 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be generated in the current and coming quarter year. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the payloads are low. Despite the boom there were few. Despite the boom
UK government wants to circumvent Brexit law? Johnson withholds
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hiding whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the latest law passed by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit. On a similar question, he only told reporters on Friday that his government will abide by the law in force.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal deadline, should no agreement be reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that complicates negotiations with the EU.
Former British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday suggested that Johnson could try to use “political schikas” to circumvent the law, and that Johnson could use a procedural bar that would postpone the law’s entry into force for the period after the EU exit.
Johnson said he was aiming for a deal with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."

Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani has raised pressure on European treaty partners in the fight to save the historic nuclear deal. “Unfortunately, the European states are showing incompetence or lack of readiness when it comes to concrete actions,” said Verhden, referring to the fallout at a press conference on Thursday at the UN’s New York border.
Against the background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in retaliation included the pledge to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The US withdrew from the agreement in 2018 alone, in order to "maximum pressure" Iran to change course in which Trump's retaliatory policies are perceived as aggressive.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used or prepared the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium, and Iran is also preparing to build more than 300 additional centrifuges, according to IAEA data.
Perhaps the Europeans were not ready to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and burdens of pressing US sanctions, Rouhani argued, but there will still be further talks, which hopefully will come up with a solution.
Rouhani denies Iran’s involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the common position has changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. However, the US-backed Huthi rebels had initially acted as a deterrent to the U.S.
"Those who raise such accusations must present evidence of this," Rouhani said. However, the European leaders in the talks with him during the UN general debate could not have done so. Instead, they would have called only on the Prime Minister to carry out an attack on the rebels in Yemen like this one.
Before possible talks with U.S. President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the U.S. administration would first have to be lifted, Rouhani demanded, urging the government in Washington to shift to a policy of "dialogue and reason."
Comet from another star crosses the solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This was only achieved once before. The comet allows for conclusions on other solar systems.
What was initially just an assumption is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named after its discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The far-reaching comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also ours.
2I/Borisov is, after 1I/'Oumuamua from 2017, the second interstellar object to be seen during a transit of our solar system.
2I/Borisov gives astronomers the rare chance to get close insights into a foreign solar system before it vanishes on no-show. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as the astrophysical institute of the canaries reported, the octopus, the octopus, the octopus, the octopus, the octopus, the octopus, the octopus, the octopus, the octopus, the ocus, and the octopus.
According to the analysis, the comet has been intersected on a so-called hyperbole path, which has been transmitted from our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as reported by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been sighted at the approach. Thus, the researchers remain for many months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then will still be visible until April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes", explained Farcacchi.
Several observatories have already visited the visitor. For example, a team around Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined in a first survey the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers.
Scientists from the Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to those of comets of our solar system, and this suggests that the
The discovery of exactly two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests, according to the IAU, that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such peak visits are, it is still possible to estimate a possible mission of the next interstellar visit.
By 2028, the agency intends to station the three-part Comet Interceptor (German for comet interceptors) at a waiting position at a distance of 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth. According to Esa's director of science, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Hasinger, she will visit either on her own as a fresh comet system.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
Just before the 70th anniversary of the People’s Republic, a first passenger plane of China United Airlines landed at the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for the captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers will be delivered annually at the new airport, and by 2025, there will be 72 million. Chinese President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China’s latest prestigious project will also be “Senster” due to its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which are to be expanded to seven later, and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-Bahn transports passengers in just 20 minutes to downtown Beijing.
Even during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly told them that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 and which is much smaller, has been postponed several times. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger machine landed after four years.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - from which the British space agency UK Space Agency dreams. Ingenergen is going to be able to make this flight designed for the 2030s at supersonic speed a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency intends to work closely with the Australian Space Agency. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As previously the only three-passenger aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde had passed from 1976 to the end of the year.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport", writes Reaction Engines, among other things on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means flying at least five times as fast as the
Insurgency in Washington: Trump wants to track anonymous tippers in Ukraine deal
In the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down possible unsightly locations in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," Trump told U.S. Embassy staff in New York on Thursday, the person in question was almost "a spy" and with such in the past "a little bit different" than today.
This was considered a intimidation attempt against tipping agents. The event was not actually public. However, several U.S. media outlets spread audio clips of the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted angrily to the president’s statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced on Tuesday preparations for an impeachment trial against Trump. Their allegations are primarily based on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence officer, who has been charged with serious charges against Trump and his government headquarters.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government employees, after which the U.S. president "uses the power of his office" to achieve that another country interferes in his favor in the 2020 U.S. election.
At the heart of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate what could harm his political rival Joe Biden, who is just kidding about the past business of Biden’s son Hunter in Ukraine.
Whistleblower only accused the White House of having a look at the Ukraine phone booth. He was also accused of concealment: leading government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the cover. As usual, an electronic wording protocol was fabricated from the wording of the complaint.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known; the New York Times reported that it was supposed to be an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of tweets on the topic, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had spread second-hand information that would have turned out to be inappropriate. Therefore, there may be no tipping pointers at all.
As Trump expressed in New York about those who were supposed to have leaked information to Whistleblower, outraged, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded with concern and lamented, Trump’s statement once again undercuts the integrity of the government.
The House of Representatives has been conducting various investigations against Trump and his environment in various committees for months, and in the face of Ukraine’s allegations, Democrats are now pushing investigations with renewed force to initiate a possible impeachment procedure against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a timetable for our investigation," said the head of the Intelligence Committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked the ship sharply, accused him of misrepresenting things and again demanded the resignation of the chairman of the committee.
In a statement released on Friday, more than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy field, who were mostly working under democratic but also under Republican presidents, argued that if the impeachment process were to be followed by a possible impeachment procedure, the Trump administration would have to take action.
There is no precise timetable for further proceedings. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment procedure. But the decision about an actual resignation fell in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such proceedings are still pending.
VW-Operation Council: Jobs are "slickly" degraded
The plans of the VW brand, in which production costs could be further reduced, could go at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the automaker’s operating council. The brand aims to reduce its annual manufacturing costs from ten billion euros by 2023 by two billion euros. Of this, 500 million euros will be saved in this year already.
The "Future Pact" negotiated between the company and the Works Council in 2016 already foresees the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany by 2020. In principle, a workplace can only be dismantled by the carmaker if it is proven that 20 activities are no longer required.
However, as our newspaper learned from business boards, jobs in production, which are not actually available, are "sliding" down by another route - that is to say, by the official course, so that free-standing regular jobs would often not be re-occupied.
In these cases, the Board of Directors has no means of forcing the re-employment. In many places, there is a lack of personnel, the increase in labour, the concerns about the gradual bleeding out of the vehicle factories, and the growing fear that the production of the vehicle could be diverted to and from Germany and elsewhere.
The VW brand wants to further standardize production worldwide and control new projects centrally. This also aims to reduce costs and speed up decisions - behind which is the goal to increase productivity and thus increase competitiveness. Production CEO of China Andreas Tostmann told us in a manager's conference:
For example, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year. Tostmann told reporters that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be reduced by 1.1 hours.
20 hours.
In our region, the Stammwerk Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The works Braunschweig and Salzg<0xC3><0xBC>tter produce components. For VW-intern VW-intern the rule of thumb is that there must be built 800,000 cars a year, so that the plant is only profitable in Wohlsburg.
As CEO Tostmann has already announced last year, in Wolfsburg, one million cars are expected to roll out of the band “perspectively”, which is supposed to make it possible to bundle the golf production in the parent plant – because the Zwickau plant is transformed into the location for the e-auto production of the Golf-Ferti.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. That is why expectations now rest on Golf 8. In spite of all efforts to build the e-mobility first the bread-and-butter-buttersburg.
Voodoo forced into prostitution: human traffickers convicted
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn in, dragged into the Ruhr area and forced into prostitution, and six suspected human traffickers have to go to jail for this.
Six alleged traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to up to eight years and three months in prison in Bochum on Friday. The defendants had dragged young women from Nigeria into the Ruhr area and forced them to commit prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the defendants had yet to take a bribe.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought by means of Libyan locks in tube boats over the Mediterranean Sea. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to complete the alleged lock costs of an average of 25,000 euros. Lohn was paid off.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on brothels in the trial. "The work made women physically and mentally difficult to create," judge Isabel Hoffmann said at the announcement of the verdict. "Some were right on schedule.
The judgments are based on the commercial and gang-related inclusion of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, surrogacy and serious forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm’s ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group has once again threatened Ufo with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will inform "on October 14 about the labor control measures in the LH Group", said Ufo-Tariff CEO Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have been refusing to conduct the negotiations with Ufo-Tariff for months.
In this point, Ufo is now looking strengthened after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the tariff agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and, on the other hand, examined the court's decision to file a lawsuit. "I think that a second court should consider the matter.
In August, Lufthansa filed an application with the Landesarbeitsgericht Frankfurt to have the status of the Ufo as a trade union examined in court. The company argues that the trade union has not used a representative board for months and is thus unable to fulfil its role as a tariff partner.
In the past, there has been a fierce leadership struggle in the divisional union, during which numerous members of the board as well as the advisory board have resigned, including longtime union leader Nicoley Baublies. The Ufo had, due to doubts about their leadership, expelled an already-initiated member of the board of directors and the advisory board.
Easier entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not exactly known as an international tourist magnet, but that is now expected to change. The country in the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, it wants to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the tourism commission said.
“Saudi Arabia’s opening to international tourists is a historic moment for our country,” said Ahmad Al-Chatib, chairman of the Tourism Commission.
Saudi Arabia is hard to reach for tourists so far. Visas are usually only granted for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state. With the new rules, the orzconservativeKingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones hit two of the most important oil installations in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, national oil production drastically broke down, oil prices dropped to a height.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are preparing for a wedding
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos in her Instagram Stories, on which she can be seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had been in Los Angeles’s youth group.
Justin posted several colorful, including banana-printed outfits on Instagram and asked his followers: “Help me choose my smoking for the wedding,” according to media reports, the celebrity couple wants to marry church next weekend.
The Biebers gave the word "yes" in a New York office a year ago, and there was no big party at the time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that the two found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in the western Czech Republic. The wreckage was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Mechin), police said. The dead included a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been searching for the machine since Thursday evening, after the crew had issued a distress signal by GPS. A military helicopter was also in use during the search. The cause of the accident has yet to be determined. The crash site is located about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plosch Rezen) and 100 kilometers north of Pilsen (Pluch) north.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, there are also diseases, alien species, non-sustainable logging and the growth of cities causes the threat, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) reported on Friday in Brussels. It has not examined the stocks of all the other 454 species of trees known in Europe.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "threatened", "strongly endangered", "threatened from extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct".
Evergreen and wild ross chestnuts threatened
One of the authors, David Allen, of the German Press Agency, said: “Most of them are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the transformation or weakening of their habitats.”
It also looks bad for the wild ordinary red chestnuts. They are considered to be "dangerous" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan mining moth next to a mushroom. It has been spreading from southeastern Europe to the whole continent since the 1980s.
Strawberries and moose are also in danger
At the same time, the IUCN scientists created new European red lists for soft animals, shrubs and moose. More than a fifth of soft animals and moose and almost half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This was mainly due to the destruction of the wild boars and weevils.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underappreciated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. "We need to limit the impact of human protection on our ecosystems and limit the protection of these ecosystems.
Istanbul Earthquake: 34 Injured Reported
In the latest earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. No deaths were reported. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged since the quake on the previous day, with nearly 200 aftershocks. The magnitude 5.8 earthquake shook the Marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday, triggering panic in the million-strong metropolis.
Now, the government wants to use a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Under the Marmara Sea lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and Anatolian earth plates.
One of the heaviest quakes was one of the magnitude 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was at that time in G<0xC3><0xB6>lc<0xC3><0xBC>k southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed.
Already on Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 earthquake shook the region around Istanbul, calling on residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira appear in the half-time show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. The singers announced on Twitter. "It won't be bigger", wrote Shakira to a photo of herself and Lopez. She's excited to be in the Super 2nd Bowl.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had been dreaming of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - that's when she saw Diana Ross fly into the sky at the half-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL can be 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored to stand next to another artist on one of the biggest stages in the world and represent Latinos and Latinos from the United States and around the world. "And then again on my birthday!" the main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, "It's the best time
Shakira is from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining viewership
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most-watched TV broadcasts in the United States. Even if you’ve seen the numbers drop recently: This February, the show attracted the fewest viewers in the United States in more than ten million years.
In the past Super Bowl half-time show, there had been a stir: In the dispute over the handling of quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February, media reports say that top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 was leading the half-time show.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, was predeceased in the 2016/17 season before NFL games at the National Anthem from protest against police violence and racism went to his knees. Kaepernick himself triggered a movement with his protest, numerous players took over the gesture, Donald Trump took over.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to be expensive to pay for travel provider Thomas Cook’s lawsuit, according to a press report, which threatens high depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans, including credit Suisse, the Financial Times writes in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would probably have to write down on their books totalling up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.8 billion (around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion), according to the report.
The creditors of bonds would have to purchase amortizations of <0xC2><0xA3>900 million to <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion, and the lenders would have to buy between <0xC2><0xA3>550 million and <0xC2><0xA3>825 million, and the amounts actually to be amortised would have to be at the upper end of the range, an expert told the paper.
How great the losses of the creditors will actually be in the end, will be shown after the bankruptcy proceedings. A person close to this procedure did not have too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 aircraft of Thomas Cook in the UK will be "old" and many of the properties will be rented in the same place.
Rackete allegedly brought killers to Italy
Sea-watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are believed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We can't rule this out, but we don't have any secured information about it ourselves," said Sea-Watch refugee organization spokesman Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of having raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators have been arrested in the detention camp in the Italian Messina. New builders stressed "couldn't come to check on them, they couldn't come to check on them.
On 29 June, Carola Rackete had smuggled migrants into the port of Lampedusa and rescued a ship from the Italian financial police. On that day, the three suspects are expected to have arrived there. Investigations are underway against the captain for aid to illegal immigration.
U.S. Warns Federal Government of Huawei
The head of the US Internet Agency Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government to trust the Chinese network equipment maker Huawei.
We believe the risks are too high,” Pai told the “trade sheet” with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a “national security law” that obliges any company “under Chinese jurisdiction” to comply with instructions from security agencies.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests,” the FCC chief continues, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to request a “confidential declaration” from suppliers.
Berlin first wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Trade Journal", relying on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not consist only of the hardware:
Precisely the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time,” Pai said.
It would be "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency, "regardless of where it would be able to check each individual update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC chief continued.
The Chinese company Huawei is making close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership relationships are opaque. The employee company that allegedly belongs to the company is not necessarily independent of the government,” Pai told the "Trade Journal".
Pai was recently involved in talks in Berlin to promote the position of the U.S. government employees within the company.
Chemiefabrik in Northern France burns: Schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A giant firewall lights up the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire has been extinguished after hours - but the clean-up could now take days.
After a fire at a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and kindergartens in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be opened in advance on Friday, the competent prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to expose themselves to smoke. Injured there were no victims. Farmers and breeders were called to their
The fire could be completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There is still the risk that after the deletion odor is spreading, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police officers and gendarmes were employed at the fire station.
A giant black smoke column had previously risen from the chemical factory. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol plant, which manufactures additives for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city center.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In 1976, a devastating chemical accident occurred in the Italian Seveso near Milan.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news channel BFMTV that there was initially no "high toxicity" detected in samples. However, a pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out. In the river, dams were built against pollution.
The fire broke out early in the morning around 2:40 a.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the Eurozone.
Germany must invest, and the sooner the better,” Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens in order to make the necessary decisions.”
Those countries that would have budget slots for more investment would have to act, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these gambling halls, the minister added, referring to its country’s high state debt, which accounts for more than 98 percent of gross domestic product. French government debt must be “stabilized” and “lowered,” Le Maire said.
In recent years, appeals to Germany have repeatedly come from France to make more public investments to revive the European economy, while German politicians have repeatedly called on France to get its budget deficit under control.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday foresees tax reliefs of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 billion for households.
The French government is reacting, among other things, to the protests of the Yellow Vest movement. The new debt is expected to fall to 2.2 percent, according to an expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson dismisses question on Brexit tactic
British Prime Minister Johnson is sharply critical of the "Capitulation Act" passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes the British prime minister to avoid a chaos Brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole, but to address this possibility, the Tory politician refuses.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is keeping himself covered up about whether he wants to implement an irregular Brexit - despite the law last passed by Parliament, which is intended to prevent this from happening. On a similar question, Johnson told reporters only, his government will abide by the law in force.
The law requires the government to request a postponement of the withdrawal deadline, should no agreement be reached with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major had on Thursday expressed the suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political scandals" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural bar that has shifted the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit.
Johnson’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, said he felt the political discussions about Brexit were “walking in the park” and was confident that the desired EU exit would still be there: “We will enjoy it, we will win time, we will not be spending time on it.”
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" in the run-up to the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as chief strategist in the UK government's seat of Downing Street, behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister into a near-escape situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (pockets) plunges deep into the very private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visibly proud and touched when he presented the picture book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, including the illustrious guests Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Chris-Frenters-Frenters.
Following the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting look into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of the legacy of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film".
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made it, a few hundred of which are now first published in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments", writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, there is always one at the center: your husband Paul - how much you want him.
There he does not dance with his daughter Mary on her shoulders, telephones in the bathrobe with a bag on her head or wears a shapeless moonboat. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary Bet family, but that beyond the spotlight on their farm in South England or in Scotland, Carthage has been saying that a normal babysitter also lived in Scotland.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the instant. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than mere snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to clip it at exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you clip it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it might have to be a completely different photo.
There is the light, the composition, the image cut and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but besides everything anecdotal is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes are already looking like abstract paintings.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from neighbouring countries despite US sanctions against Iran, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published Friday that Turkey could not stop importing oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there,” Erdogan said in New York, where he had attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil, as some companies had “retired due to US threats.”
Nevertheless, Turkey “will continue our relations with Iran particularly in this matter and in many other matters,” said the Turkish president, who has repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. According to the United States, Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear program and is not adhering to the agreement.
Its sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf region have increased significantly in recent months.
U.S. government wants to restrict admission of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict the admission of refugees. The U.S. Department of State said on Thursday that the annual upper limit of a resettlement program should be reduced from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees. That corresponds to a cut of 40 percent.
The State Department said the United States would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, but the main task is to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the U.S. immigration system is overloaded.
In the future, the U.S. government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are being persecuted for their faith – and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as is apparent from the statement of the Foreign Ministry.
Under the program imposed in 1980, refugees from UN camps around the world are selected and resettled in the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program’s history. Already the current upper limit of 30,000 is a low value. As the predecessor of Trump, Barack Obama was a low value.
“This is a very sad day for America,” said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, who said the United States would continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the world’s most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the U.S. - both legal and illegal. The U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming fiscal year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump: “Come near a Spitzel”
U.S. President Donald Trump has targeted whistleblowers in the whistleblower spying business. Whoever has given the whistleblower who accuses him of abuse of power, “comes close to a spit,” Trump said, according to a recording of a private event on Thursday afternoon in New York.
When asked about the person who informed Whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, Trump replied, “It’s coming close to a spit.” Then Trump added, “Do you know what we’ve done in the old days when we were drunk?
Observers assessed the latter's comment on a possible reference to the death penalty. The Democrats sharply criticized Trump's statements and accused him of intimidation of witnesses. It was also an attempt to prevent a congressional inquiry into a possible prosecution against him, to prevent the prosecution of the defendant, and to prevent the prosecution of the defendant from being prosecuted.
Whistleblower accuses the president in a now-publicized complaint that Trump has abused his office in order to invite interference from another country in the 2020 US election. Specifically, it is about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Selensky, referring to his summertime sophistication:
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower himself and his informants are, but as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is said to be a CIA intelligence analyst.
Refugee boat chained: baby and toddler drown in <0xC3><0x84>g<0xC3><0xA4>is
Over and over again, people are trying to get from Turkey to Greece via the Aegean Sea, where the often too small boats are regularly moored. Seven migrants have now been killed in the sinking of a hose boat - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the sinking of a tube boat. Among the dead were also a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be rescued from the floods from the occupation of a passing ferry.
Among the victims is also supposed to be a locksmith, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea, mostly in much too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) 17 people arrived on this route.
The Who break off concert
A US concert of the rock band The Who has come to an abrupt end due to the impossibility of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday night (local time) in Houston, his voice failed. On the eighth song, Daltrey said to the audience: "I think I should leave it, as long as I can.
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologised and added that Daltrey could "not really talk right now". Townsend promised the audience to come to his expense at a refund concert, but an appointment is not yet set.
For Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, The Who said they will be re-recorded at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Renting suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tingling
In New York, WeWork became the largest office worker.
Within a few years, WeWork will rise from a small startup to a driving force in the world’s most expensive real estate markets, but now the company is in crisis.
WeWork's bankruptcy threatens to disrupt the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had dismissed founder Adam Neumann as its chief, moved the planned stock exchange and began to sell subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the executives.
WeWork now hires large office spaces in the long term and hires them in the short term in part small units to members. These can be individual freelancers, small startups or whole departments of large corporations. So far, MiWork with this business has been burning money at a breathtaking speed.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now signed leases with terms of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge commitments could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to economist Dan Alpert of the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, had been operating on nearly 300,000 square meters of office space in the past 24 months.
Even in the UK’s capital, the balance on the real estate market could shift noticeably without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is head tenant, in an office building bought last year by Sparkasses fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros in the center of the financial center.
Many landlords have converted their real estate for WeWork’s requirements with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners would have to write off part of the expected billions of revenue. The owners have not managed to gain access to the - but scarce - reserves of WeWork
Russia once again caught a number of North Korean fishermen
A total of 262 more poachers have been arrested in the past few days, who had been illegally fishing in the waters, the Russian FSB’s domestic intelligence service told Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way in the Russian high seas. In 2018, the coast guard of Russia is conducting patrols to protect their marine biological resources. In the case of the new controls, 30,000 incinerators were discovered. In addition, the data were recovered after three fishermen and two fishermen were killed.
The Russian fishing authority did not issue any fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, according to the media, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been detained there for some time in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with the dense synthetic nets banned in Russia. These would be used to make small fish out of the mechs and mechs.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured in the arrests last week. A similarly wounded North Korean later died of his injuries, according to the FSB. On September 17, Russian border guards first set up a North Korean patrol boat after a North Korean patrol boat.
U.S. Bans Ex-President Castro
The U.S. has imposed travel bans on former Cuban President Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Castro and his children, and the U.S. State Department on Thursday said in a statement with Castro’s involvement in “gross human rights violations.” As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean state, more than 100 police officers would be arrested and imprisoned in front of a system.
As the head of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also blamed for human rights violations there, through the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro. "The violation of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime are due to the former President of Cuba and the former President of Cuba, Mr.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued a travel ban, among other things, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition has been raging for months. The U.S. has imposed a number of sanctions against Maduro’s government and imposed sanctions on him in retaliation for his actions.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduro. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of sent doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government in suppressing the government.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go to the streets again for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is planning to resume actions and announcements in dozens of countries around the world. Due to the time shift, New Zealand and Australia are expected to start before the protests move across Europe to North America.
How much the global opposition will be on this Friday after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg herself was good things. "Last Friday more than four million people have struck for the climate. This Friday we do it again!", she wrote on Twitter. She added.
Especially in Germany, last Friday’s influx was very large. A good third of all the world’s mass demonstrators – around 1.4 million – had participated in the protests in 575 German cities. This time, according to the movement’s list of towns and villages in Berlin, according to K<0xC3><0xB6>lten, in at least 65 cities.
At the age of 15 at the time, Thunberg had sat before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 in order to call on the politicians of their country to make a stronger commitment to climate protection. From this, within a short time, the Fridays-for-Future movement has arisen.
Together, they call for more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate catastrophe, and above all, under the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be reduced to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York almost a month after a two-week transatlantic session with a high seas race yacht, where she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she was the Head of State and Government of the Netherlands.
Russia bans smoking on balcony
People in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This includes a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the emergency ministry said on Thursday in Moscow, according to the agency Tass. The ban is expected to come into force on October 1.
Those who still smoke must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should set off a fire, then the penalty will be higher. According to the ministry, the ban also applies burning candles. Grilling meat dishes on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Attack on cybercriminals - Investigators remove servers
In the fight against cybercrime, German investigators have for the first time raised a large server provider for illegal businesses on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle, through the internationally active criminals operating their craft.
This was shared by the Prosecutor General’s Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening in a major action. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
The suspects’ customers are said to have been the operators of the world’s second-largest darknet marketplace for drugs, “Wall Street Market”, which investigators had destroyed in the spring. Also, the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was overrun by a cyberattack, according to the Attorney General’s Office.
This is the first time such a host has been raised in Germany, it said. A web host provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
In the access action with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and in neighbouring countries. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, investigators want to inform about further details.
New Global Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go to the streets again for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and announcements in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as J<0xC3><0xBC>chen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to take part in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests <0xC7><0x80> Who are Thunberg’s men?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that heat up the climate. All the more amazing that even a 16-year-old girl keeps the powerful people in front of her own mirror or wants to be in control. But what is the climate behind it?
Greta Thunberg, on the one hand, has moved beyond the masses and brings young people up to a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young man has managed to win a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212 he has won the prize for a child named K<0xC3><0xB6>lnus, who has been named after him.
But there is a lot to be done about it. We don't have time for it. We don't have time to save the world. Greta Thunberg has a rich PR manager on her side. Her mother also published a book that was well-sold thanks to her husband.
Is it morally right to enrich oneself financially by saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain groups of people work together with stockbrokers during the world rescue operation? No matter what position is ultimately concerned with it, it is important from the point of view of democracy and is always reflected in the point of view of democracy.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crosses Through Our Solar System
A strange comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The assumptions of astronomers have confirmed: A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. He was named after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently employing astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov on the Crimea. He looked with a self-built telescope towards the sky and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that has not comets from our solar system that he is two.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain insights into a foreign solar system from close proximity. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. The comet is clearly of interstellar origin, and thus moves up and down from the sky, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC).
Comet has already been sighted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But only before it is so far away, astronomers can observe it in depth. In contrast to its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in its approach, which means that it can be examined from the ground for many months. "The object will be reached by the mid-December with the greatest brightness of the telescope and then
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about Comet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body appears to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de Le<0xC3><0xB3>n puts it, the spectrum of the tail star is similar to ours.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years, however, may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids are constantly re-occupying the researchers, and it was only recently that a giant asteroid passed by the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson shocked at brother
When Boris Johnson leaves the cabinet, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, and his sister whispers in clear words the warlike language of the prime minister as "tasteless"; he is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Treason", "Treason": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to equip - at least verbally. During the interrogation in the lower house this Wednesday, this came upon the massive outrage of the opposition, and in the meantime, more critics have reported: Dozens of bishops and his own sister, Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, dragged, quartered, teased and feathered". She considered this to be extremely reprehensible. She recognized the EU's anti-parliament to Johnson's "Don't say again"
She was particularly upset that her brother Jo Cox, an EU-friendly House of Commons MP, was murdered by a neo-Nazi just days before the 2016 exit referendum. Their memories could best be honored by passing through the Brexit, Boris Johnson was angry at the House of Commons.
The widower of Cox also sharply criticized the prime minister. "It makes me sick if Jos name is used in this way," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to be passionate and determined about what you believe to be a - no matter what opinion you are in. But no matter what side you are on, you should never be offended.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, Jr., had resigned his office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory MP. "I have been torn between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months - it's an indissoluble tension," Johnson said.
Johnson's language also met with sharp criticism in the church. As the "Times" reported, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "is not worthy of this country". In a joint statement, they declared: "In the past days, too, the language is also in the hands of the reshab,
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform in the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is putting on a strong sign: In the semi-final show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming U.S. Football League semi-finals on Thursday (local time).
“I feel incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the United States,” Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American football league, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2 in Miami. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Herftica Floor") is puer.
“I love the Super Bowl this time putting two women on the stage – and two Latinas,” Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show “an explosion of fun and energy.”
The 50-year-old was born in New York City after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" major hits and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works in the actress and is the actress in November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer, making her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is expected in the United States every time with excitement. This year many consider the selection also as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the biggest U.S. sporting event and at the same time a giant commercial show. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones have been there for furor. As a rule, Germany is watching over 100 million away in the NFL Finals.
Last year, there was political controversy in the foreground. The reason was the dispute over quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to raise himself in protest against police violence against Black when playing the national anthem and for this reason, among other things, Rock President Donald Trump had been attacked hard by the quarterback Colin Kaepernick.
An actor and YouTuber is setting up Egypt’s ruler: first, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have been incarcerated in the past two weeks have been incarcerated in the past two weeks, the former has been incarcerated in the Cairo airport. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi has been incarcerated in the streets of Egypt, the former has been incarcerated in the past two weeks, the former has been incarcerated in the United Nations General Assembly, the former President has been incarcerated in the past.
Lands leading to error - this attempts in the opinion of the president of the other man, who is currently determining what is happening on the streets. Mohamed Ali of course remained abroad, where he escapes the access of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he was trying to enter the Egyptian ground.
He goes to the head of state directly and in a completely rustic language. While the people are hungry, shivering the president in luxury and being allowed to build magnificent new palaces, it is said there. The army leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, is pushing the reins of corruption and enrichment.
The proteges had not been arrested since last week. The proteges had been arrested for the first time since Sisi's seizure of power. The proteges had been demonstrating thousands against his rule and almost 2,000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "millions march" for this Friday, and the video went on.
From the town of Mansura in the Nildelta, where protesters threw banners last week with the portrait of the president in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the roads of the fall.In Cairo, several subway stations were stopped in the inner city
Mohamed Ali caused these measures to change his tactics: "Our target does not have to be the eating place", Ali said in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us collide with police officers". But as a retraction, this is not to be understood: "All of Egypt is the eating place".
If the provider promises too much power
If the Internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options.
Those who enter into an internet contract do not need to blindly trust the speed data of the providers. Customers can check for themselves how much of it is actually achieved in case of any setbacks.
Finally, the pre-promised transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bavarian Consumer Centre.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than that of the provider, there are various test options, so the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transfer rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the testing of the providers is carried out according to the provider-specific specifications and is therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively," says the consumer centre of Bavaria.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of 14 days, as a rule, in order to produce the promised performance.
If this does not work even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and, in some cases, also request compensation. However, if there is no success, only the lawsuit will help.
First-ranked Republican to be investigated
As the first high-ranking Republican, the Governor of Vermont has spoken out for impeachment investigation against U.S. President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that comes from is determined by the facts that are being determined," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in a phone call to investigate the interventions of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
Republicans have so far resisted criticism of Trump over the Whistleblower affair; few have been able to recognize dissatisfaction with it. Scott’s statements are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump’s policy on several occasions, and has already turned against lobbying for retaliatory measures, for example, against lobbying.
Spider-Man to remain in MCU: Further Marvel movie planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August, it was announced that Sony and Marvel would go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how the Tom Holland films should proceed.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man is getting another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home", according to several U.S. media outlets, so the film will be released in July 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel-Booss Kevin Feige is quoted as saying: "I'm glad that Spidey's path will continue in the MCU. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are very pleased that we can continue working on it ... He's the only superhero with the ability to continue working on his Sonsey in different universes.
But what about the sudden good news? Apparently, Sony Marvel is supposed to have submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, Disney, which also includes Marvel, would participate in the revenue of upcoming Spider-Man movies with 30 percent. However, the news is not confirmed.
How Princess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now reached the grand finale. In the final there were many Happy Ends and as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years.
One foreword: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some of the most memorable scenes with today’s Duchess showed some reflections. For example, the moments of the failed and the lucky one after his wedding with his lucky one.
But even her real husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned only occasionally in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) steps in the direction of the altar to marry his fiancé Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey makes a bewitching, bewitching 4
<0xC3><0x84>g<0xC3><0xA4>is: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned in the sinking of a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard said on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are crossing over to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean Sea. Last year, 174 people were killed on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that both countries will be joining forces.
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner responsible, he wanted to "inform Turkey about the refugee situation" in his country, Seehofer said on Friday, after which he wanted to be able to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help with the situation.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission on Friday confirmed Seehofer’s planned trip with EU Commissioner for the Interior Dimitris Avramopoulos and France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, an unusual number of migrants from Turkey continue to arrive, with 654 people being transferred to the Greek islands on Tuesday alone, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increase in the number of refugees and migrants arriving illegally via Turkey to the Greek islands has led to doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement, which was concluded in 2016. In contrast, the EU wanted to send back all refugees and migrants who came to the Greek islands illegally.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only arduous on the Greek side due to lack of staff. Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos have almost 29,400 people, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: In a camp with capacity for 650 people, 5,200 are currently under Migra.
There have never been so many since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, the state broadcaster reported.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, president of the German Society of Cardiology.
Green politician has to be held accountable for embarrassing photopane
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was manipulated for this reason by the cup?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way cup in his hand in one photo, but now it turns out: The cup has been manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained unnoticed for quite a long time - and was finally noticed by the post. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw has Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, never held in hand. On the party's website, she was also seen on a photo with this cup, all in conversation
Green boss has to be held responsible for photopane
The National Post then rejected May’s manipulation and that the party produces Fake News to appear more credible on the topic of “environmental protection”, and that in the middle of an election campaign for the lower house election, in which Trudeau is also increasingly struggling because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and started the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their disposable cup".
May only showed up in shock and insisted on her blog, not knowing anything about this action. To underline this, she immediately posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, she correctly put it on bamboo. She was always talking about it, she was always talking about it.
"I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian, and at the same time asked something from her over-committed team: "If they want to edit a picture again, then I don't think they can do anything about it.
The German Greens also came to Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of flight trips - their pictures were not photographed, so the Bavarian Greens chief, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons during the holidays, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencerin Wants Free Upgrade: Lifetime Flight Ban at Cathay
Jaqueline Ng reportedly received an upgrade from Cathay Pacific via email, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneously get an upgrade for the Business Class - many passengers dream of it. Sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a change from the Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how not to do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the departure flight, the Jaqueline employees refused an upgrade, although they presented an email in which their Cathay Pacific allegedly put an upgrade in view. The writing wants the influencer to have received from a marketing employee of the airline. The airline, on the other hand, has accused Jaqueline of having failed to do so.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight. This time the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The staff at JFK airport were skeptical: they were after the central. And in fact, the staff were supposed to be at the same place.
The airline employees at the airport cancelled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifetime flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (around $1,280) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because Cathay had refunded her the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket back.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains locked up for future flights, and the airline’s terms and conditions also state that she doesn’t have to pay for the new flight.
Oil prices according to report on ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Last time, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent cost $61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55 percent.
The trigger for the slide was a report by the Wall Street Journal about a ceasefire in Yemen, and Saudi Arabia is said to have approved a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil facilities in Saudi Arabia had brought down five percent of the world’s oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels allied with Iran in the Yemeni civil war had claimed the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia would make the region as the U.S. government blames Iran
If an agreement is actually reached, we can focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the raw material strategy department at Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg news agency.
The price of oil thus continues its downward movement of the past few days. A week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost $59, Brent almost $65.
Most recently, Bloomberg had reported, citing insiders, that repair work at oil facilities in Saudi Arabia had progressed faster than expected after the attack in mid-September, so the production volume again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved back towards the original menu.
Most recently, there have been several press releases calling for insiders reporting rapid progress by the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work, but raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco currently wants to avoid a stock market entry and negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and the Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the capture by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port, the crew is now preparing to depart with the crew on the ship, while the ship continues to sail.
However, the U.S. has announced that it will move missiles and soldiers as Iran’s arch-enemy to Saudi Arabia, and fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and Britain had pushed oil prices up at times in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump are intensifying
In the case of a possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump, allegations of cover-up against the White House have become loud. Several leading government officials would have made an intense effort, after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Vladimir Selensky.
North Korea considers Trump and Kim's third summit in question
North Korea has raised doubts that there will soon be a third summit of Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump in the nuclear dispute. The meaning and the prospects for success of such a meeting are due to lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore.
The U.S. had done nothing so far to implement the summit’s resolutions last year, the adviser to the North Korean foreign ministry said, and he also criticized tightened U.S. sanctions and the joint military maneuvers of the U.S. and South Korea. But he hopes to come back to a “wise” and “courageous” approach.
Trump had said on Monday that he only wanted to know what a third summit meeting with Kim should bring before he prepares for it. Negotiations on a disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile program have been stalled since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim resumed in February at the summit in Stonoi.

Pound under pressure - interest rate cut expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of an imminent drop in interest rates, the pound is losing value against the euro.
The Bank of England (BoE)'s (BoE) Bank of England's (BoE) short-term interest rate hikes to <0xC2><0xA3>1.2269 on Friday.
The triggers of the sales were statements by the note banker Michael Saunders. This brought a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be turned down, as the uncertainty will affect the UK economy in the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising to note that Saunders's policy as a fraudsterisk is a renegade.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed to the burden on the economy by the Brexit hiccack without directly signaling a drop in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to take his country out of the EU if necessary even without a divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says trade magazine editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian Manipulations Proved
Material from the Moscow Analytical Laboratory is being manipulated - this is confirmed by David Howman, the former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and today's head of integrity of the World Athletics Association.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details about the doping scandal in Russia are coming to light - and they destroy the little of credibility that the Russian sport had gained at the beginning of the year and even only gradually. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Lab finally delivered to the required samples from the 2015 World Cup.
In December 2014, the Sportsman was revealed to be a systematic fraud in Russian sports.8 The Wada had been a member of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee was a member of the Russo in 2016 after individual examination.
Lack of Positive Findings
The following September, the Wada raised the Rusada ban again, but called for access to the lab and the samples mentioned. The data should provide information on the extent of the concealment of doping cases during state doping. They should help to punish athletes and athletes subsequently. They were killed three months later.
The Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has received the receipt of the receipt of the receipt of the receipt of the receipt of the receipt of the receipt of the receipt of the receipt of the receipt of the receipt of the receipt of the receipt of the receipt.
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: the Athletics Association is the only organization to hold the ban on Russia. At the World Championships in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they train outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already placed manipulations in the room and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the re-blocking of the Rusada and in the worst case also the exclusion of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
