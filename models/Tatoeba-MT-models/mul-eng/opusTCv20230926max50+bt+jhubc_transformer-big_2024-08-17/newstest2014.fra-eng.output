Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital, on Thursday.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination of wings), it passed at 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many badads had gathered to observe its exploit.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners are struggling to find the money needed to repair the down-to-earth highway infrastructure, many are finding a solution in the form of a small black box that sticks over the dashboard of your car.
The devices, which record all of the miles traveled by a motorist and transmit information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices to reshape the outdated funding system of major U.S. roads.
The sector generally without interest in major axis planning has suddenly led to a lively debate and strong alliances.
The libertarians have joined environmental groups to put pressure on the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road you travel on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party has landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about privacy.
And while the members of Congress fail to agree on whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental ride.
This is really necessary for our nation.
“It’s not like we had the choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, CEO of the Southern California Association of Governments, who predicts that the state will start recording the miles traveled by each Californian driver by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do that.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded with taxes Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don’t buy as much gas as they did before.
Cars can travel more than a mile with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The gas tax is simply not tenable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed trackers on 500 cars to test a mileage payment system.
“This is the most logical long-term alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls this the cost of mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces the city liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits in a way that reduces congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the state's ambitious climate warming laws.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the House of Representatives Transportation Committee, said he also considered it the most viable long-term alternative.
Proponents of the Reason Foundation’s free market also appreciate the idea of getting drivers paid per mile.
“It’s not just a tax getting stuck in a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits that are provided to them.
The movement is also backed by two former U.S. Secretaries of Transportation who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go on the path of paying a mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have carried about 10,000 cars.
But the House presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who must travel many miles every day to get to work or to the city.
However, several states and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country’s most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay the state kilometre fees instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois is trying a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their bare facts and gestures.
“The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads the strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something that people want.
From the start of the test, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged location devices.”
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily walks and events.
Nevada is one of the few states that are moving away now to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact place or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, the citizens will be more comfortable.
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small California start-up named True Mileage.
Initially, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to states.
It sought to penetrate the emerging auto insurance market, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices it tests have been good to the big axis planners because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t record their speed and don’t locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of certain States.
There are far less expensive means and far less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state.
Other States hope to sell the concept to unsuspecting citizens by allowing the devices to do more, rather than enough.
In New York City, transport officials are seeking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay parking costs, provide “pay-to-drive” insurance, and create a dataset on real-time speed from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
“The drivers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them,” said a document on urban development.
However, some transport planners wonder if the whole debate on mileage payment is not just a huge diversion.
At the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes.
A single or annual additional tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of gas, so everyone pays their fair share.
“There is no need to resort to radical surgery when you simply need aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs at the commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unreleased Albums
The English musician did not end up surprising this year.
Starting with The Next Day, released in January, he has concocted a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several new releases.
Four have already emerged on the canvas.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone in their shoes.
On his 66th birthday, on January 8, 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last album, Reality, dated 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that one could still rely on him to spark the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
Not surprisingly, David Bowie had more than one lap in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke announced that they would re-release the album on November 4.
For the occasion, he has concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, titled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four previously released clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
He introduces each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and covers, a booklet to share his own impressions, a booklet with words...
And, above all, he gives a taste of his new Atomica title, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and a skillfully mastered rock electricity.
Unpublished ones already being listened to
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-faced: a disturbing intro before a light ride that gradually slows down to leave room for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer at any rate appears in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, by the way, was much more serious.
In Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again makes reference to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The riffs of guitar, sending, make you want to leave Earth.
Bowie enjoys playing the chameleon with these titles: turn informant, man on board a rocket, Martian potential...
He hides and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
It is not surprising that he has a mask in his hand in the photography of the Louis Vuitton’s “Invitation to the Voyage” campaign, of which he embodies the new face.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted on saying that the wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and neo-Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson ensured that before their release, members of the army followed a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All the wounded soldiers are receiving appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured military personnel - who do not meet the army's "university of service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year re-qualification eligibility period.
They cited in particular two cases reported by the Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London, Ontario reservist with post-traumatic stress disorder, was released from the army despite his request to stay one more year in order to receive a fully indexed pension.
His case came after Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before he was ready because he did not meet the universal service rule.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that was completely different from wanting to leave the ranks.
“I told them I wasn’t ready,” he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has struggled to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks, but who are not fit to fight.
Under the current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented last year in Parliament indicate that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the required service time to obtain pension benefits.
Liberal spokesman Jim Karygiannis called for the reinstatement of Corporal Hawkins on Wednesday, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice".
Disney Put on Tablets to Launch a Animated Series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to prioritize tablets to its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
His worldwide launch on the Disney group's channels is scheduled only in 2014, details the release of his Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, intended for children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the cat Callie, a sheriff of a western American town where she rules the order with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
“Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today,” said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This type of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important,” he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of under 2 years old already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of under 8 years old, compared with 10% and 38% two years ago, respectively.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the issue of U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence whistleblower, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele met on Thursday Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: “Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as an escape and seeks to penalize political speech with accusations against which it is impossible to evade.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community might persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of spying and stealing state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make this possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been put to the test following complaints that the NSA had overheard German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who leads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness “without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States”, it was necessary to take advantage of it.
Mr Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele, a German Green MP, posted a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he would have to be given the assurance that he would be “safe” there, the MP said.
Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a “serious and sustained” campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global response to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – have judged that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public use.
The letter calls for an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers might well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter, and finally the on-demand video service Netflix via their TV in the not-so-distant future.
Cogeco’s subsidiary said on Thursday it was currently conducting preliminary beta testing of this platform with some of its users.
“This will allow us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options,” Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet said in an interview.
Cogeco C<0xC3><0xA1>ble is thus setting the stage for its competitors, such as Bell, even though Cogeco’s subsidiary does not yet have an exact date with regard to this new platform.
“We have to adapt and change or resist change and fail,” Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that he could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service is said to be in discussions with some major cable distributors so that its service is available through their streaming platforms.
The P.D. of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for <0xC3><0xA0> la carte services.
“It’s been about two and a half years since we say that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important channel packages doesn’t work,” Audet said.
However, he hopes that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to some interesting recommendations.
“There will need to emerge from these discussions a kind of new frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy in terms of television,” said Cogeco’s CEO.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and is expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco indicated that it recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82<0xC2><0xA2> per share.
This is a decline compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83<0xC2><0xA2> per share, from the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline due to depreciation costs associated with new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the US-based cable distributor Atlantic Broadband in 2012 for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also bought Peer 1 Network Entreprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco’s revenues, they saw a growth of 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are $1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90<0xC2><0xA2> per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93<0xC2><0xA2> per share, from the same period last year.
Cogeco Cable’s revenue, however, increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is up 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned about the number of customers fluctuating in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from one quarter to the next with a very lively competition.
From horse to beef products
Horse meat has been detected in canned beef products, sold by two small British low-priced distribution brands, the food hygiene agency said on Monday.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA at a height of 1 to 5%.
"As horse meat is not mentioned in the ingredients list, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency said.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France has been the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products thought to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people, early Friday, on Route 131, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist who was driving north, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that was arriving in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
The traffic had returned to normal around 6 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 for passengers carrying hand luggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines is considering starting to pay up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them on the plane’s descent.
The new hand luggage charges apply to bags placed in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said she would pay $25 if the fees were paid in advance and $100 if travelers only paid once at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokesman Kate O’Malley said the $100 was planned to encourage travelers to pay the fees in advance.
“We don’t want to pay that price,” she said.
The airlines began to pay for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who were trying to avoid these costs put as much stuff as they could in the hand luggage stacked in the upper compartments, so there was often no more room in these compartments.
These charges are a way to ensure that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O’Malley said these new fees will not really serve to raise money.
It’s about making Frontier’s most loyal customers understand that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their ticket on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger making the queue at a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these charges before arriving at the door.
Frontier’s hand luggage charges will not be applied until the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people in Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines pay enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them have not been affected by baggage charges.
Spirit Airlines Inc. applied the first hand baggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant company followed a little later.
The only other company that imposes such charges is Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said consultant to airlines Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit’s carry-on costs were $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently travelled on Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding gate at the time passengers would discover the unusual hand luggage charges imposed by the airline.
“I’ve never seen such a fluid boarding procedure in my entire professional career,” he said.
I was waiting to see toothpicks and a fight burst out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, “passengers boarded at the speed of light.”
Frontier also acts as Spirit and charges $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier has indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can be reserved for free.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for the drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after passengers complained and when no other major airline had followed.
Frontier’s decision to pay for hand baggage charges when passengers don’t buy their ticket directly from the airline is its last effort to encourage customers to go to its site.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of going to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, she began offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced her mileage premiums by 25% on a trip.
Thus, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and she loses money.
Revenues fell by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to rectify Frontier’s finances by selling the airline.
The NSA is calling into question an "internal error" and not hackers for breaking its site
The National Security Agency working in the shadow said Friday that it was a bug that had caused its public site to crash for a few hours, and not hackers as some had claimed it online.
"NSA.gov has remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the breakdown of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactical is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The once ultra-secret NSA, a time nicknamed the "No Such Agency", has found itself under the spotlight and has been heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its vast communications surveillance programs at the national and foreign level, which have been leaked from NSA's files to NSA's
This growing controversy around the agency has sparked much speculation that tonight’s incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
The Delta City Centre now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to let its employees down.
Employers came to meet employees directly on the spot, we met the employees individually to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” says the Regional Director of Delta Hotel Work Relations, Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
“Or he was selling it to someone else and that’s what happened,” said Paul Arsenault, head of the Transat Tourism Chair at UQAM’s School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be completed within two years.
For Titan CEO, “Goodyear Amiens’ purchase project starts with zero employees”
After slapping the nail in January for the partial resumption of the Amiens-Nord Goodyear site promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tire company Titan, said today he is ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the plant counts.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced it on Monday, October 21.
After giving up the factory purchase project in January, you return today.
You had spoken of violent attacks and insults, talking about "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "foolish" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this turn-of-the-mill.
Is this a pleasure for Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man trying to save industrial jobs among the highest paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of taxation and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries you work eight hours disabled France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I have no prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has space to expand.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this plant.
But, with the right price and skilled workers, it’s worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered employees a good start-up allowance, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, imagine that Titan buys Goodyear the closed plant.
Therefore, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
Now he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among the approximately 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
Also, Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear sign an agreement on starting allowances for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said that you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm this?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting fees.
If all employees accept them, the plant’s purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide long-term guarantees when there are no more employees left on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg succeeds in getting the CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier's profits are falling, while aircraft deliveries and orders are falling
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from a drop in orders and deliveries of aircraft during the third quarter and from contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide in-flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial launch schedule by September.
After the inaugural flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the latter only flew three times, and the question then arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
The results were not up to the forecasts and the stock price declined by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Bank Financial, downgraded his rating on Thursday from “overperformance” to “sector performance” due to the low potential for stock market growth over the next quarter or the next two quarters.
“Although the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division,” Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We believe Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight testing program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is so far modest at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of in-flight tests to validate the company’s claims regarding the energy efficiency and potential savings of the new airliner.
At present, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 firm orders before commercial commissioning of the first aircraft.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday by telling them that the program was progressing in line with the schedule.
“The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft’s downtime.
Each manufacturer plans in a different way.
We decided to make a first flight and plan an update period, and that’s what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly after, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier said it was assessing the schedule of entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
“This slow flight test – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be delayed in the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The result per adjusted action remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues declined slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world said it had delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders have fallen to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Aeronautics revenues fell by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest rail manufacturer, said revenue from this division had increased by nearly 11% to $2.1 billion.
The Transport division’s order book totaled $32.6 billion as of September 30, a slight increase from December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport division have suffered from execution problems regarding some major contracts.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier’s share price, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google Inc., would sit on the board, fell from 8.5% to 4.83 Canadian dollars on Thursday afternoon.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest aircraft manufacturer in the world and the closest competitor to Bombardier, reported on Thursday a 10% decrease in its quarterly profit.
Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists were carried missing in a vault under the Tooth of Crolles since Thursday evening, the Is<0xC3><0xA8>re rescue speleo was learned Friday.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one eager to practice and the other not, had gone underground Thursday around 9:30 p.m. to make a crossing of the Tooth of Crolles, located on the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We haven’t heard from them since, the same source said.
"Speleologists should have come out around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to the rescue team in charge of the rescue organization.
Dozens of people on site
About twenty rescuers, ten civilian members of the French Speléo rescue force, as well as gendarmes, CRSs and firefighters were present.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
“It’s another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network,” explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th Battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chambéry were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They lost themselves in the network, turned on their steps while waiting for help, the prefecture said.
Refueled, they should emerge from the cavity with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists’ union on Thursday invited its members to stop using the online services of Google and Yahoo in the wake of new revelations about the activities of the US and UK intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo search engines and messages until further notice," she said in a statement.
According to the Washington Post, it is “scandalous” that the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected mass information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
“The research done by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them,” said Michael Konken, president of the union, which claims 38,000 members.
Fires repainted: MP calls for resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
The project of Minister Brigitte Grouwels to "relift" the poles of the signalling lights in Brussels does not appeal to everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched a test project in the centre of Brussels on Thursday to repaint 16 poles of signalling lights of the region in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The aim is to “increase security” and “Brussels identity”.
The idea is, in the end, to repaint all the Brussels signaling lights, at an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is “too dark,” according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of “flamandization” of the capital and demands the “resignation” of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content to spend the money of the Brusselsers crazy in relifting the signaling poles to the colours of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues his operations of Flemishisation of the Capital," Mr. De Bock said in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally painted herself in dark-blue-yellow-black the Brussels poles.
According to the MEP, there is now "no more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselsers deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD&V minister who herself realizes the NVA program.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
“For the record, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected with 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of the Bruxelles!” said De Bock.
the Portique de Pont-de-Buis disassembled
The Pont-de-Buis ecotaxe gate, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled on Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national road was diverted in the aftermath.
The decision of the dismantling, announced by the prefecture of Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Wednesday, was made by the company Ecomouv, manager of the portico.
This is the last of the three ecotaxi gates in the Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessories store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of the Google Signed Connected Glasses.
They can thus acquire a listener, a charger or a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers a few accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a protective cover made of microfibres or an intra-aural earpiece.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction glasses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father wiped himself out of the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I spoke of him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn’t know how I was going to continue to “go to” it.
There is no recipe, no mode of use to cross the wall of the invisible and find his.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle wake up in the middle of the night to watch his watch that no longer leaves me, placed on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my daily actions.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found his body empty, scratched on this hospital bed with frosted sheets.
Similarly, his funeral was an glacial farewell focused around the thin glow of the candles that would frame his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, through small, day or night appearances, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly came back into my mind, evolving as she resumed her place in the landscape of my thought which was believed to be mourning.
And then, she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost the person of my mother in any way but simply a woman I did not really know, a woman who embodied that person, during his stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and whole.
This detour from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, “inside and outside,” he seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was sick...
He was talking to me, constantly encouraging me, he was living my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I loaned him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It took a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer there, but I feel them all the time.
Every event, every moment of my life, makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I always dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only there is always one thing that prevents me from accomplishing that moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams take me on the contrary and fit into my story and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
On the eve of my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was waking up, I was getting out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor and he smiled at me and was glad that I was expecting a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to mean to me that he was happily sharing what was happening to me.
And of course, there was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I am delighted to share this common memory lived after his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother was dying of cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family in Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused at the young bachelor that I was at the time.
After all, I realized my grief pretty quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in times when I’m in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and being interested in the Middle East, to the point of mastering it in a large school, have not been, with the decline, anodic choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and speak of Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values that she instilled in me are always present, so I get to think about how she would want me to act at some point.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to be up to the generosity and the straightness of the mind of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see her eyes on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
Died after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all the phases: the misunderstanding, the anger, the pain, the tears that trigger themselves, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, moments incongruous.
Then time calmed down the pain.
There is only the lack, this emptiness without response, this need for her, to entrust me, to reassure me in the hollow of her sweetness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his worried eyes on me, I see the blackheads that weigh his eyes, the wrinkles around the lips that the cigarettes cross, the folds that mark the forehead on the days of worry.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my 3 children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We constantly feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile, and to pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I speak to her in the hollow of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the moral is a little bit reached.
We feel carried away and protected in difficult times, the downfall of time makes us realize how much she was a conductor and we try to stay on the path that she had drawn us.
If a being has loved you very much, the absence cannot take it away from your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 due to asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I could not attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions conform to his vision of things.
I also had problems with my work for these beliefs.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what he will think of it.
I don’t know if I’ve adopted his way of being or if I’m just like him: Is that genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he's here on a daily basis.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It was almost thirty years ago that my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6 years old.
The immense punishment that then invaded me has of course attenuated but it is always close to me.
Very often it "lands" into my dreams in such a precise way, so vivid that when I wake up I am even sadder to see that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I said no, he answered me "I'm going down" but with a voice so real that I woke up in shock, I was anxious and I lit the bed lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I still live in the same house, and often, I feel observed and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would not leave this house where we were happy and or his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the bloodiest month since 2008
October has been the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures this Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
“We don’t tell the world to be by our side and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it,” Al-Maliki said in Washington on Thursday.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled, it will spread, and what is happening in Syria will spread as well.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They brandished signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug godfather of a police investigation has been jailed
42-year-old Basharat Ditta gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would not be revealed on the big day.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Court of Appeals.
A senior defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after being compromised due to his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by the criminals to be a "primary record", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officials spotted Sarborough, 32, depositing three bags of cocaine at the lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a Bar dinner with confreres.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought to illegally obtain information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough as well as one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking taking place in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine for <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, as well as more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would not be revealed on the big day.
Today, at the Liverpool Court of Appeals, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Solicitors law firm in Blackburn, has fallen into disgrace after being found guilty on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer’s downfall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been regularly in phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and found him arriving at Ditta's home and placing the drug, pure at 60%, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposition, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, the Blackburn Rovers club's venue.
The lawyer went back to his house, discovered the drug, and they called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied consuming cocaine. He said he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During her arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from her.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that it happened that clients called him home for legal issues.
But the court heard testimony that he was calling major actors in the drug trade, some of whom he represented, after key arrests to tell them what investigators were aware of.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, “If someone needs to know that you shouldn’t violate the law, he’s a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with private clients.
The relationship we’re talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing the drug to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will no doubt be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this has gone well beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to pursue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta didn't honor his profession, but he dishonored it.
He got too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and he let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, “Mr. Ditta has gone from criminal criminal counsel to criminal himself since he started getting drugs from criminal organizations.”
His cocaine addiction compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the back-and-forths of the leading members of organized criminal groups who charged him with obtaining valuable information regarding police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the most stringent integrity rules and establish a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to shelter himself behind the varnish of his profession.
Lancashire's Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three chiefs of cocaine possession and now obstructing justice, bearing witness to his commitment to prosecute criminals.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and translate you in court.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five others involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question/answer session about himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death row in America, his last guest to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be back on stage in December
The Detroit News newspaper reports that the Queen of Soul will take place on December 21 at the Sound Board room of the MotorCity Casino hotel.
In November, Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the illness she was suffering from, Respect’s famous interpreter told the media on October 16 that the side effects of treatment she received were “difficult.”
She says she is "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lights
420 patterns, 2.2 kilometers of sea edge covered with a coat of light: one could rub the heat in Menton with the lighting bill.
Invoice which, unlike many municipalities, is additionally regulated by taxpayers, and not by trade associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport Evacuated After Shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, at least two people were injured.
This would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the firefighter.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a panic wave.
Travelers and staff rushed to the exits or on the tarmac.
Very soon police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was arrested on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is disrupted.
The classic song for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five sayings imagined and interpreted by artists in the region, cartoons with a high dose of humor, teenagers are allowed to take advantage of the classic song.
In addition to this show, the Société d’art lyrique du Royaume will return with its Lyrical Destinations, a formula that now makes room full of the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
Added to these activities was the Apero lyrica, the benefit concert held last August, with the competition of the soprano colourature Marie-<0xC3><0x88>ve Munger.
It was a profit-making activity, in parallel with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as an air of The Mousetrap.
Without delivering precise figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday, in Chicoutimi, to prove reassuring.
Despite the precarious nature of so many cultural institutions, the future is drawing well, even in the long run.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
“Finance is in flux and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step we will take in seven years,” he said.
"I'd even say beyond," added Director General Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been accused of hostage-taking, kidnapping, threatening, carrying a weapon in a dangerous design, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," Corporal Bert Paquet said in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New request for collective action against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new request for collective redress has been filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that would have taken place this time at the St. Joseph Oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the applicant's testimony, identified as "J. J"., which would have been masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher Brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the oratory where his father-in-law, Saint-Joseph, was working.
The first appeal was aimed at only three institutions, and when the settlement was announced, many people told us, "I, I was in such a place, can I sign up?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both cases.
The collective appeal that has just been filed has, in particular, allowed the addition of complainants from any institution where abuses could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the Congregation of St. Croix and the Oratory of St. Joseph, which is a distinct entity, "have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "have exercised a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", and that they "have exercised a moral, psychological and spiritual constraint on the victims".
These latest accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Sainte-Croix brothers, Mr. <0xC3><0x89>mile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuses.
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Superior Court.
Once admissibility has been admitted by the Court, the second stage is taken, namely the substantive hearings.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were conducted on the merits.
An important fire in a trade
A fire severely damaged a trade in the LaSalle district of Montreal on the night of Thursday through Friday.
The rescues were called around 1 a.m. on Friday, due to a fire that broke out in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Rue Réjane.
The 30 firefighters who were sent to the scene took nearly an hour to control the brazilian.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said the head of operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments might have to be accommodated on a temporary basis, the SIM said.
Many Oppositions to Medical Aid to Die at the Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favor of the principle of the Medical Aid Bill to Die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a spokesperson for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If we were to focus on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical aid to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
“What is the meaning of life,” she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the vice president of the Alliance of palliative care homes, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes the service would be useless anyway.
We are never asked, “I want to die, give me an injection.”
The director of the Association of Palliative Care of Ontario, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill disorients the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will take the step.
For her part, Gatineau’s Liberal MP, Stéphanie Vallée, says the concept of end-of-life will need to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan press outrages over controversial media law <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
“This is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask yourself the following question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?”, the paper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent news radio stations and websites.
He said the new media court "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to the parliamentarians,” he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to have "manipulation on the media". The Standard said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had suffered a hard blow" and smeared the bill as "draconian".
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time as a train of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping centre last September.
Kenyan media have angered authorities by broadcasting images of surveillance cameras on which troops deployed on the scene of the attack allegedly stole the so-called luxury shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by calling two journalists and a media official to question them, although the call was withdrawn following a media shield lift.
Under the new bill, the media could face fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the added risk of being “removed” or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of a perpetrator if the perpetrator has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations.”
He also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “animated blogosphere.”
By reducing the media to silence, politicians know that they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
“Delivered to themselves, the politicians would put the country into bankruptcy and bring us back to hunting and picking.”
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of people’s anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission in charge of wages and restored their mirror salaries of about 532,000 shillings per tax-exempt month – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Centre de santé et servicios sociales (CSSS) de Laval caused a lot of excitement to the management of the Hospital de la Cité-de-la-Santé, during the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short-term departures, the department of pharmacy found itself to be highly staffed.
It lacked nearly 30% of the necessary staff, making this financial year "very difficult," according to department head Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to engage in independent labor, which can cost up to three times more than a full-time pharmacist.
We didn't use the troubleshooting, Mrs. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities inside the facility have been streamlined or decreased to accommodate the time when things are moving.
It is certain that we have worked hard to interest our young [pharmaceutical residents] to come and stay here.
There is a competition of circumstances that has made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved Situations
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is much easier for the department of pharmacy of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain them have borne fruit, as the four students currently residing in Laval have also decided to remain employed by the CSSS.
Now, it's going much better, the pharmacist pointed out.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will therefore fill our departures from last year.
The ever-growing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as those experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have an environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always run three maternity leave when it’s okay,” she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and there are no pharmacists available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The top model of 22 years does not start his career in cinema by the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose him to portray Charlotte Gainsbourg as a young man in his next film, Nymphomaniac.
This pornographic drama depicts, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a four-year-old acro-sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin’s resemblance to his elder brother is striking: a bridal silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and of French-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of the risk: the one who had not hesitated to lay bare on ice paper will appear in much more sulfurous situations on the big screen.
An excerpt from Nymphomaniac has raised the temperature on the canvas: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their pulsation in the closet, he used X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before fusing all bodies digitally: above the belt, it's the star; below, the lining.
From Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing her actresses into their final cut-offs, always for the best.
Stacy Martin didn't finish talking about her.
A Narbonne CGR room evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precaution, as a result of throat piercings felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility proceeded to evacuate the room and warned the firemen of a suspicious smell.
About 70 people left the meeting.
The people were examined and full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on the bottom of a teary-eyed jet?
Or involuntarily?
It is always the case that the management of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was aired and everything went back in order.
The cinema has been able to reclaim its rights and the customers find the pleasure of the images.
Only on the screen.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins
Taking advantage of Halloween, a woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins into the country on Thursday morning at Montréal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of the luggage of the passenger that the drug could be detected.
Cocaine had been divided into three previously emptied pumpkins.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCG) office, which took over the investigation.
The Canadian Border Services Agency (CSA) did not reveal where the woman was coming from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, a spokesman for the CBSA.
What I can tell you is that she came to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border service agents at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border agents in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1,653 seizures of narcotics.
Air raid on military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace early Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening, according to the Lebanese army.
A cargo of SA-8 short-range ground-to-air missiles would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid of the Tsahal airfield in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances roughly identical to the one that had taken place on July 5: at the time, it was also an anonymous US official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting the Yakhont land-based missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not concealed their irritation at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine Is Approaching Bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's solvency rating on Friday, questioning the former Soviet republic's ability, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's public debt securities goes to "B-", sinking into the speculative investment category.
It comes with a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances of it being down again within a year.
“It is less and less likely that the government’s strategy will ensure enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs,” the U.S. agency said.
The agency notes that Ukraine’s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities have made massive use of to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency is increasingly likely to judge a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses him of failing to pay an $882 million bill.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbor, furious at Kiev’s willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public following the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its still relatively modest debt has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, down from less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has for months been seeking the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, which had granted it a credit of $15.3 billion in 2010 and has so far only unlocked 3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranches until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "significant external financing needs" constituted "a vulnerability", but "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud, of the Centre for Political Studies, “one cannot expect a short-term improvement.”
“There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year,” the expert said, referring to the 2015 presidential election.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" related to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditional on the release of opponent Ioulia Timochenko.
“Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be short- and medium-term negative consequences for Russia’s reaction,” said S&P, which fears Moscow’s “trade restrictions.”
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that if a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev is created, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
U.S. green light at the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they had received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the world’s first advertising agency.
The merger actually brings the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group announced today the expiry of the review period of the previously announced merger of Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two groups said in a statement.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions meet several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the operation.
“The merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory approvals and approval of the shareholders of the two groups,” they added.
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were going to chase the M23 rebels into their bases in the forests and mountains of the North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the verge of being beaten after being driven out of the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) towns it had controlled since the insurgency began 20 months ago.
“We’re going to pursue the M23 and patch it up wherever it hides because it’s criminals,” Colonel Olivier Hamuli, a spokesman for FARDC, told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials said they had evacuated the towns under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the rebel’s political leader, told RFI that these military setbacks would not change his demands for peace talks in any way.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the government of Kinshasa and the M23.
Hangings are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last village in the hands of insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion was established in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, benefiting from the escape of the government garrison and the passivity of the Monusco blue helmets.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in DRC, the world's largest in terms of personnel, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For his part, the FARDC's general staff was remanded and the army went on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
“The M23 seems to be coming to an end,” said a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his Congo Siasa blog.
It would be historic – it would be the first time the Kinshasa government has succeeded in beating a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied with Rwanda would be present in the eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, which strongly denies it, of militarily supporting the M23, consisting of former Congolese mutiny soldiers.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman announced.
Last week, Kigali spoke about the possibility of military reprisals as a result of shells falling into Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the bourgeoisie to welcome the entry of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable to us that one day we would be released by the army," said a resident of the border town of Uganda.
“We have lived in terror (of M23), we are traumatized,” he added.
Tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have been found to be negative, the health ministry said.
“The two cases identified in May 2013 remain therefore the only two confirmed cases in France to date.”
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of being injured after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed 50 people.
Chevron, the second U.S. oil company, reported on Friday a decline in its quarterly profit due to a decrease in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining in decline compared to the group’s goals.
Its net profit for the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters averaged a per-share profit of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company aims at 2.65 million bpj for this year, with an expected growth of 25% of production by 2017.
Much of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures have increased by $7 billion over two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Thus, Chevron’s main competitor, Exxon Mobil reported a net profit down on Thursday, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
School transport: the complaint deemed admissible
The School Board of the Region of Sherbrooke (CSRS) requires a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students benefiting from school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes made to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
“There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested,” Lef<0xC3><0xA8>vre explains.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediation and asked for an additional time frame to reflect on it.
“It’s always better to talk about it, to get together and find solutions,” says Lef<0xC3><0xA8>vre.
The School Board of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency rooms of the Hotel-Dieu
Faced with the squabble that has been raging for several months by some of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10 to "delay the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the closing date of the emergencies that will not occur on November 4."
An official request was made "to avoid running any risk on the handling of the emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but also aimed not to disturb the PS campaign a few months from the municipalities.
Despite the ministerial orders, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Even if the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" is preferred at the APHP.
As of November 4, firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual passages to the emergency rooms of the Hotel-Dieu will have all received orders to take the 30 serious cases per day to the emergency rooms of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu, emergency rooms will be open on Monday to five general medicine rooms.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the current of the month.
“The Hotel-Dieu’s emergency reception service must close as soon as possible, and for us it’s November 4th,” said Lo<0xC3><0xAF>c Capron, president of the APHP’s Medical Establishment Commission (CME), who supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," said Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical director of the new Hotel-Dieu.
“But we will continue to welcome patients in an emergency,” he said, stressing the continued presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain in place, he said.
But it is up to the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency response service.
“Things are happening gradually,” said Nicolas Peju, ARS spokesman for whom, on November 4, “there will be no change in terms of service rendered.”
“The minister lied to us or we lied to him,” says emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Released from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the charge against the reorganization project, he defines himself as an "alert launcher" in the face of a "cynic" decision made by "the medical-administrative technostructure".
“They are emptying and asphyxiating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago,” he said.
For him, “if the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem.”
But they are regularly worried.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for the emergencies of Lariboisi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
In the ARS, it is argued that thirty patients "dispatched" on several sites are not at risk of representing an "avalanche" in the other emergency services, whose human resources will also have been strengthened.
ARS and APHP have been defending the "new hospital model" already launched since October 7, which is expected to continue to host 30,000 to 35,000 patients a year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners should also be involved in setting up a "permanent outpatient care".
“Where do we go if people are asked to self-diagnose,” Gérald Kierzek asks for whom “the concept of a not serious emergency” is “dangerous” and marks a “medical regression”.
This is going to be the same as for level 3 maternity.
People are not crazy, they are going to go where there is the best deal of care.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the armband, warns Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency doctor and member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP Paris adviser and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hotel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to the responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, reiterated on Monday morning on France Inter that she had spoken out in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, she would mark her net disagreement, said Bruno Julliard, her spokesman.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-Dieu has its legitimacy in the background, we cannot accept it without an acceptable pattern of referral to other hospitals.
Obama Ends Hearings on IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop listening to it on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House’s attempt to take back control of the NSA’s hearings following revelations made by former Russian refugee analyst Edward Snowden.
This is the first time that IMF and World Bank monitoring has been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the start of the scandal.
Asked about the matter, a U.S. administration official replied: “The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance targeting the World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington.”
Expressing himself under the seal of anonymity, the person responsible did not specify whether such monitoring had been carried out in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had ordered the practice to be stopped in the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the hearings at the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday approved a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of such information.
The United Nations welcomes the new goals for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now begin work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been set up 12 years ago to combat poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in highlighting the “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began yesterday in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “overcome national interests.”
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process to set universal sustainable development goals (SDGs),” he added.
These SDGs will build on the progress made in the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my best to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that are based on the success of the MDGs.
Concern about security in Mozambique is growing at the same time as conflicts erupt between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, in mourning them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace to come back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, general manager of an investment firm.
Worried about her country’s future, she swapped her work clothes for a tee-shirt with the word “we want security” in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in the capital’s Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo, the worst hangovers since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and then South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Brazil Valley, Eni and Italy.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo reject each other's responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is at the origin of the recent clashes and that it launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, and Fernando Mazanga, Renamo’s spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering conflicts, and accuses him of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a “loser” who wanted to use “all the strength he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government.”
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the deal was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to calm tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
“There are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep fighting,” said Joseph Hanlon, an open university lecturer and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate well and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of suffrage collected by the Renamo has been steadily declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to get a greater number of suffrages in the elections.
Mazanga said that Guebuza – who is expected to retire at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not known exactly what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has led to disturbing lightning attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the suspensions took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has bolstered the frustrations the government is causing, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the leaders of the country’s future are the government and the president, and that it’s up to the president to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people only wanted stability.
“No one cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to the roads,” he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as “life-style models,” the author says.
Thor's Legend could show that "brutal force does not weigh against subtle russe," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be “far too violent, far too scandalous and in some cases too obscene to be taught at school,” Crossley-Holland advocated a “minor selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I find it great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are “openly didactic” makes children “fully catch up” with messages being “sublimated” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or finished well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublime; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and what is not said.
A Hamas military fighter was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza have been told.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they wiped out an Israeli gunman’s shelling.
NSA spying: U.S. 'goes too far', Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in terms of spying, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged, in this first Washington statement in full dispute with Europe over the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time a US government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in intercepting communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant you, as the president did, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future," Kerry said at a conference in London that he was participating in since Washington on Thursday, Oct. 31 via video link.
In his retransmitted speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of U.S. diplomacy has long justified the information and information gathering practices by the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention of possible attacks.
In reference to the attacks of 11 September 2001, the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and the London attacks in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the U.S. authorities had since thwarted many bombing projects, through interception of communications and the collection of information.
“We actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being killed because we were able to be aware of these projects,” he said.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way," the secretary of state, who had already had to speak about this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome, said.
He said on Thursday evening that President Obama was “decided to try to clarify and that he was reviewing these practices so that no one would feel wrong.”
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to inflate this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The paper, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the program dubbed "MUSCULAR", and conducted with the British NSA counterpart, GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from the optical fibers used by Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in the last month alone – ranging from metadata on emails, text items, or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from U.S. allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the U.S. press claimed that the U.S. president was not aware of such a hearing, Barack Obama refused to speak out on the matter, citing national security.
However, the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the bullet back to the European intelligence services that would have caught up with these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve “military operations” in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and it would not target Europe at all, General Alexander said.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international spy network that has also sparked the wrath of China.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his master, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the club of Ligue 1 in a statement.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco in a goal difference, has released the list of players retained for this 12-day match, without including the 32-year-old striker.
The statement simply states that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee on his return of selection, at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated deceased
The crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a lay ceremony, in memory of all the deceased cremated in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at the Paris City Hall, will attend the event, and will then explain her funeral proposals at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funerals of a loved one, the opposite is true: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, insists on the "violence" that cremation constitutes, for the survivors.
There is, with the cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a lot of ashes" in very little time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which refers to the "elimination of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is it that what is accepted without pain in some Nordic and Protestant countries, is still poorly lived in France?
“Because cremation is a new fact,” says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Hynatology and author of the book Appriviate Death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to privatize it.
It is for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Michaud-Nérard, Director General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to provide for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with a burial.
Ipsos’ annual survey shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their loved ones, whether religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers want it too.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
“For over a decade, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the ash delivery,” said Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the establishments now propose masters of ceremonies, which proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to name the deceased, to connect with others, to evoke him, to give meaning to his death, to organize farewell.
This has been the case at Father Lachaise’s crematorium since 1998.
The masters of ceremony are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several memorial ceremonies, secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of the people who were cremated in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is relayed to the attention of those who could not make the move.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, the relogation for rats turns to the controversy
At the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
In the face of the urgency of the situation, the director of the Terres du Sud Habitat office proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to relocate the couple and their three children to a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken excessive proportions, according to Jo<0xC3><0xAB>l Canapa, the director of the office.
There have always been rats in the cities.
The deratization company carries out two passes a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats don't jump into the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, one will not kill a child.
“We didn’t invite the rats at our house,” defends the family father who left his home to settle down at the hotel.
We are soon without the sou and we expect a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange Ends Down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange went down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rate fell from the dollar against the yen, detrimental to export values and warning of its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix dropped 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony dropped more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house set on fire in Old Quebec
A fire that started on Friday afternoon in Old Quebec was quickly mastered.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 rue Hébert.
The flames broke out in a three-storey house on four floors behind the courtyard of the Québec Seminary.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, who were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firemen arrived, they really saw the apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms went off, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here," said France Loiselle, spokesman for the Quebec firefighters.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremonial master at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the audience, about the tone of the conversation.
Fay’s innovation has continued over the years, until it was taken over more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolinas stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of the headlines have emerged in the Carolinas, and have had great success, until they have become too famous to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for veterans, organized at Madison Square Garden, which will be attended by, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart and Roger Coger.
The festival has grown in size, just like the world of comedy.
Several of the comedians taking part in this year’s festival have gone through non-traditional circuits, featuring shows on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of fantasy football happily lascivious from the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the show "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the cast of the series "Parks and Recreation", but she is still best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young stand-up comedians (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting takes place at the City Hotel, in the center of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in Larry’s comedic DNA of all the work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that, when he was here, sometimes he would walk down a street between two buildings and he would say, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here."
Oil price continues to fall and close to $96 a barrel
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the importance of inventories offset a report showing that China’s electricity-intensive manufacturing sector is intensifying.
The price of the U.S. benchmark crude for delivery in December dropped from 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived Friday, which show a growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to tighten after growth rebounded to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, following a decline that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, has lost 26 cents to drop to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Controversy over the right to abortion in Texas
A federal appeals court in Texas has reinstated certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a law passed in July in that State and which raises a great deal of questions about the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The ruling by the Court of Appeal means that doctors who will practice IVG will have to have a "privilege of admission" to local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, under his or her status as a caregiver of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical center in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment.
Defendants of the IVG argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one-third of the state clinics as these clinics have failed to obtain this "privilege of admission" for their practitioners.
In total, it would be nearly 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these establishments.
On Monday, a trial judge had ruled on the eve of the entry into force of the law that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is running for governor, asked the court of appeal to overturn the first instance judgment that blocked the law's application.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has successfully returned to power, alongside audiences, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% of the audience.
Was the show at the meeting?
Some 10,000 candidates appeared at the hearings of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the evil Sinclair, the quarte André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program again, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored at this first prize.
As every year, the first audition shows brazil a wide selection of grassy singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Now, on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, some have found their account.
There are many who have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone all the way to the end.
Behind the TV screens, successful singer vocations are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make you laugh.
The court blocks a decision on the NYPD’s control and search policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's decision requiring changes to the New York Police Department's surveillance and search program and dropped the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals (Second Circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the end of the appeal filed by the city.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to control and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed to its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to help the police department change its policy and the training program associated with it.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments relating to the application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge had to be dismissed from the case because she violated the judges' code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part due to a series of interviews with the media and public statements in which she was responding to the co-sponsors.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their surveillance and search program.
She has appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including policy, training and oversight reform, and has ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test body-mounted cameras in the neighborhoods where the largest number of controls take place.
In August, New York City agreed to put an end to the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people whose case is dismissed after a police check.
The hearing of the appeal filed by the city is expected to take place after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This system of control and search has existed for decades in some form, but the number of recorded controls has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls that mainly concerned black men and Hispanic origin.
A court action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into collective action.
Proponents of changes in the NYPD’s control and search program say they will end unfair practices, allow for more effective and trusted police forces, and can change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morale without lowering crime, would represent a waste of money, and would not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after police personnel have been greatly reduced over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to the control and search practices, which are constitutional, but that it reformed the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Tenants must go to vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of housing that goes in taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each dwelling.
We are forced to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we go to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to make things change in the city.
All the candidates told us they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay for fireworks at $100,000, land from $4 to $5 million in the event that...
Go vote, it’s the best way to express yourself and say it’s enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entered into the 500 m2 of the Elysée kitchens as committed after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the levels until he became a chef, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande through Nicolas Sarkozy, including in their vacation spots, and fed an incalculable number of the world’s greats in a quasi-anonymous way that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years old.
The man with an open face, detachable skull and glasses of intellect, born on 24 October 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin, is the owner of a pastry CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Thessaloniki.
"I have passed from one castle to another!" said Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manias of the six presidents for whom he officiated, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
“It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus,” he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," to the point that she had forbidden women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
Don’t be disheartened by heads of state who showed relative indifference to land-based foods, “they’re all gourmands,” says Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had “a slightly more developed appetite.”
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates were empty!
As for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like".
The current head of state, who recovered the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no specific regime demand".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially at the Elysée State Dinner: between 200 and 250 people must be served in about an hour.
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The now former head of the kitchens of the Elysée, who took a drink Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, left with a pinch in the heart.
He said praise.
"His human side came out," he said.
The chief will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been in the Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the subject of flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-storey building, located at 15 Hébert Street, was the subject of three fire alarms.
The fire broke out at the front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesman for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of the flames to adjacent buildings, a size challenge for this area of the city where the buildings are built in a close manner.
The burning house was home to four dwellings, but no tenants were on the premises at the time of the fire.
The damage has been limited, even if the water has caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sappers have ruled out the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: release of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets out some pictures of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget about being reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will dissuade you from his role as a dejante trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a “Long Island Stock Exchange broker, who refuses to cooperate with the authorities as part of a vast corruption case on Wall Street.”
In the 80s, Jordan Belfort then mounts a scam that will make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man chains the holidays, the women, the drugs.
Decadence and excess of all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seem to have found the magic that had brought them together in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese took too long due to its assembly.
It looks like the movie will finally be 2:45.
In the room on December 25th, he will be able to participate in the Oscars.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson reportedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a canister on a link involving then-exercising Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her “beautiful special counsel.”
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack into Pawlby's voice box and " permanently plant in front of his door", but Coulson also called and left him voicemails.
“The indictment suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stand in front of people’s houses hoping to surprise them, it’s the kind of man to love to introduce history to people to see what they’re saying.”
He said NotW used three ways to investigate the topics: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, he cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say “Of course I do.”
Rumors of a link involving Clarke were first made by NotW’s editorial office when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said she had been told, “Don’t waste your time with her, she’s with Charles.”
A tape, on which voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private detective’s computer that involved Ms. Pawlby and her sister queued up in a “Projects” file.
During the period the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking them for information about her, Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup have overseen Ms. Pawlby’s minor actions and actions.
In a voicemail he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles.”
Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself was visiting co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having carried out phone hacking.
Barack Obama Receives Iraqi Prime Minister in Full Flame of Violence
The U.S. president was due to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, in search of U.S. assistance to fight the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in five-and-a-half years in October, according to figures released Friday by Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The UN gives an even higher record of 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
These violence are increasingly deadly despite heightened security measures and large-scale military operations launched in recent months by the Shia-dominated Nouri Al Maliki government.
The total death toll in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence scares a new embrace while neighboring Syria is in the midst of a civil war.
The bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot in the street or even in their homes, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing dissatisfaction of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being marginalized politically and being the target of unjust arrests, has fostered this flare-up of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a “world war” against al-Qaida.
The violence is at the center of US talks with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki that will be received Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the US president, elected on the promise to end military engagement in this country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and the elected members of Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a “third world war” against al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is backed by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, assigning him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence through his “sectarian and authoritarian policies.”
They also demanded that Barack Obama make Nouri Al Maliki understand that “Iran’s pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.”
Beijing accuses Uyghur group of Tiananmen attack
The Chinese interior security chief on Friday accused a group of Uighur separatists from Xinjiang of being behind the attack on the trapped car that killed five people on Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, plunged into the crowd that was on the famous Chinese capital square, symbol of the 1989 murderous crackdown, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of domestic security issues, accused the Islamic movement in eastern Turkestan of being the instigator of the attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkophone minority based in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province Eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that occur there animated by independent claims.
“The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing has been organized and premeditated,” Meng told Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV.
“The group that was behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of eastern Turkestan,” he added, his remarks being taken up by the new China news agency.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle, whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin, and said his wife and mother were in the car with him.
The latter also contained gas-filled containers and a flag with orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic movement in eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican probes contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a large survey around the world on how parishes handle sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce, and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with the order to get as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the "National Catholic Reporter", an independent Catholic newspaper from the United States.
A spokesman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide in an appropriate way to probe the parishioners.
In the UK, bishops published the survey on the Internet by asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: Army Attacks Last Rebel Fief
The M23’s irreducibles, or a few hundred fighters, were cut back to nearly 2,000 metres above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two towns located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," a resident of Jomba, who was on the phone at about 12:30 a.m., told AFP that a girl was shot in the morning.
“The intensity of the clashes has decreased a bit,” he added, “it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed back the rebels a little bit.”
According to the witness, wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before going to the front for a "scratching operation".
It was very clearly heard behind him creakings fed by light weapons.
From Bunagana, the political fief and last stronghold of the rebellion on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy gun detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the DRC, the fighting entered "in a final phase", the FARDC having "circumcised the positions of the residual M23 to displace them".
Since the resumption on Friday of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, Monusco has not directly participated in the fighting, but provides government troops with decisive support in terms of intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, were heading for the front line.
They were armed with Kalachnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, border post with Uganda, aided civilians loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a new FARDC-flaming truck, in front of ensuring the recovery of another machine piling the positions of the M23 on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila called on the rebels on Wednesday night once again to "voluntaryly demobilize" on the pretext of being disarmed "by force" but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without results for the time being.
On the spot, M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
“We have finished the talks, it is only up to the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature,” said Roger Lumbala, vice president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed by the government.
The M23 was born in April 2012 from a mutiny of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, who joined the army in 2009 after a peace deal.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala reject.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its subsurface is full of coveted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where about 5,000 people had fled between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN, the movement back to the DRC that had started in the morning reversed at noon.
“This morning we went back to our fields, but the military told us to retreat,” Imelda Nyirankusu told AFP, surrounded by her nine children, including a baby on her back.
It feels like the fires are getting closer to the population.
In the early evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this stage beast
Classic, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the productions sung and danced take their flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It is a revolution: the musical in French asserts itself as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most of the attempts were steeped in the ridiculous.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables carried the aureole of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the story.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles like successful tubes.
The first picks up, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady and announces the following the global creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On other scenes, musical performances such as "1789", "Bastille lovers" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are at the forefront of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histories of Musical Comedies" and lecturer at the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre du Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet, analyzes the reasons for the success so severely conquered.
How do French musicals evolve?
The offer has been multiplied.
There are first the "musical shows" that evolve at the discretion of the producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a 15-year-old bounce back under the pretext that you can serve pretty much anything when you have Matt Pokora in the lead.
Then we have the musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularises Anglo-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Spider Woman's Kiss" or "The Spring Awakening" have a hard time being funded.
Do we have enough talented artists like Broadway to sing, play, and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it’s a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of musical comedy, it is very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
There are many jobs among regional theaters, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The talent pool is as consistent as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are the tours in the province so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few theater pieces go on tour and it is often a boulevard theatre for adults and not for young adults.
The musical performances fill this gap.
It is these same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of an enthusiasm of these young girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are wisely held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a Zenith of the province.
The mayonnaise is raised in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major halls of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the ring of Brussels
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning around 5:30, on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is free of charge.
The ring was closed to traffic, until 9 a.m., at the site of the accident, the time the road is cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.

A seriously injured child in an attraction at Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old boy was seriously injured after an accident at an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed until a new order.
DRC: Army prepares new attack
Children play on a carbonized shield that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing on Friday for a new assault against the last M23 rebel strongholds near Bunagana, in eastern DRC.
The goal is to displace the M23 from the hills that overlook Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall by herself.
There will be no more than Runyonyi Hill.
"Chanzu's is not very strategic," North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to go to Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and last stronghold of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was retaken on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducibles of the M23, are cut back to almost 2,000 meters of altitude on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the nearby village of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had reported fighting all day Thursday said the situation was "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting of the day before and were buried.
One girl was shot, and three others were injured, including a serious one, evacuated by the FARDC, said the witness quoted by AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two fighters have given no record of casualties in human lives.
NSA disclosures increase corporate paranoia regarding state surveillance <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter overflew the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
On the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media explain that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence services, reiterated in September that the U.S. does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became a whistleblower, began to reveal his inexhaustible treasure trove of information on the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know if the director should be believed in words.
Reports that the US National Security Agency has been spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever sparked corporate paranoia about state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that caused the vessel to overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are probably also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and businesses transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data should be used in their mutual interest.
“Germany needs to wake up,” said Oliver Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n, president of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe the U.S. poses as important a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the EY consultancy firm.
However, in all the documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are sceptical about this.
A member of the German parliament said that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly.
“This is not the right way to do it,” said Hasso Plattner, president of the German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
Anything but the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations was a shock to some companies who thought so far that China posed the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A big change is happening in cloud computing since European officials have become aware that the data stored in the United States is governed by the laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10% of non-US members have given up their plans to use a US cloud storage service provider after revelations about the US Prism data exploration program.
“Our customers are asking us today a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It's no surprise that there's economic espionage.
There's always been.
“This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion,” said Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF Chemicals.
Americans spy on us commercially and industrially just as we spy on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to disclose the prevention measures they have put in place, in case this leaves the advantage to an opponent.
Big companies have long been hammering the message that it’s at least reckless to retrieve a free USB key during a trade show or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the board of directors of the automaker Audi, says that collecting mobile phones before board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
Germany’s BfV advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on their trips abroad due to the risk of compromising the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown away.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV said in a report.
The United States is alerting its own companies to economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty to the second degree of committing acts of hacking economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company estimated that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French Interior Intelligence, DCRI, said in an interview this month: “Services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a Georgia teenager, who died in unusual circumstances, think their son was murdered.
The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found in a fighting rug rolled into his high school gymnasium, think their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found trapped on January 11 in a draped rug standing behind the steps of his high school gymnasium.
County Sheriff’s investigators in Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson had died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old boy’s family disputes these findings.
“They are absolutely certain their son was murdered,” said Benjamin Crump, attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as stated in the sheriff's conclusions.
“They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person(s) responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a notebook and we gave him to them in a mortuary bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a news conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
“I believe there is a sufficient basis” to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from “positional asphyxia.”
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“A lot of questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he comes up with elements of a nature to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office representative was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered the authorities to hand over all video surveillance footage that investigators had examined.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video footage contained clues to the circumstances of his death.
CDC Releases Child Allergies Advice for Schools <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a series of guidelines on how to manage children’s food allergies at school.
This is the first series of guidelines that the U.S. government publishes, as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies has climbed sharply.
One in 20 children in the U.S. today suffer from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children had increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize the faculty and staff to food allergies in children, and on how to treat them in case of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the EpiPen brand self-injector being the most commonly used – to be able to react quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, “I feel like something is biting my tongue,” “I feel like I have a hair on my tongue,” or “I feel like I’m biting my tongue.”
NSA Case Highlights Total Absence of Intelligence Debate
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand blurs in public by convening the U.S. ambassador on 21 October, and on the other hand prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, based on the rumor of the presence on its board of Edward Snow?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is that of the extent of U.S. surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and on the other a condemnation of the NSA’s Orsay Quay hearings?
Wouldn't there be a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but a search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks raises the bar on the analysis by U.S. diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we consider that, in the eyes of American power, this is an important illumination.
When we describe the American systems of interception against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to indignify ourselves from this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations targeting our interests?
Is it possible to get rid of American collaboration?
The introduction of very powerful interception technology tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism for the past ten years.
In this area, in particular, France and the United States have put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of information which are almost daily and which are described on both sides as essential.
As an example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services, and, in return - as has already been said quickly - Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the fundamental issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to equip themselves with interception tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly within parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the scope that must be theirs, and ultimately the question of the attacks on the libertarians.
What is the real risk of the United States, a degradation of their image?
It's nice to denounce them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk to Americans can be twofold.
The first is when their allies – and this has been the case recently – learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are relying, in the light of the revelations, on entrusting their confidential data to U.S. providers subject to U.S. laws, and therefore to the NSA’s takeover.
Last item: the vast movement of revelations engaged by media outlets around the world, which helps spark a debate on the practices of surveillance of intelligence services that until then almost non-existent, could prompt lawmakers, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their services.
Parents of intersex children can choose “indeterminate sex”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be attributed to them, rigidly, at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to enter an “indeterminate” or “unspecified” sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the heavy pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make early decisions regarding sex reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain the patchwork created by the doctors, contusioned and balafre.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, intersex being part of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term meaning people with chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) atypical or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to attribute it, then wait and track the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a surgical act, if necessary.
Dr Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and sex-identifying specialist, said the new German law “seems to be a good idea.”
Intersex children have an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require a surgical act, but this is not the case for most children,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It’s like the mystery that surrounds gay people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender people, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time or clearly defined.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sex characters (such as muscle mass, hairiness, chest and stature), primary sex characters (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the scale of acts of harassment and violence and prejudice-based crimes.
Young boys of non-conforming gender now have camps that are specially designed for them.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to register male, female or “third sex” sex on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as “neutral” after winning her appeal trial that allowed her to keep an “unspecified” sex alive.
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are always the subject of controversy, according to a report published on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition for the “gender theory” to be removed from school books.
The American website Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that “since the world is dragged into a new realm where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are thrown away.”
In Maryland, the mother of a baby also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer sex to be attributed to babies at birth.
“The role of a parent is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know the sex of your child,” she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the magnificent Greek god who had double sex.
And barely a decade ago, the medical community regarded the genre as a slate, one can erase and one can re-draw on.
But now, many are questioning the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his or her sexual reassignment when he or she grows up.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malleable.
He devoted the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as being male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan", his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a broken circumcision to have him castrated entirely, also removing his testicles, and raising him as a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that was not the case,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors “always repeat this pattern.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations said “[that] they are not satisfied with the result.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors couldn’t really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical ablation of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I wasn’t happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he had a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he found out horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sex development disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment and got his breasts removed.
The surgery made it sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called the Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, general manager of California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “invites labelling and stigmatization.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child “indeterminate” sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to attribute a male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the so-called third gender."
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal gender,” she added.
German law deals with the attribution of sex to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead to at that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter suffers from a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said the German law would “responsible” parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, at the age of 29, Katie is married and an intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or carrying mothers.
“The law leaves some latitude for parents so they don’t have to make urgent decisions,” Baratz said.
This leaves them time to do some tests and understand them, and a time before enrolling “male” or “female.”
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You do not have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
“This puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing what is right,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he/she feels most comfortable with – and that’s something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of her government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes his government will hold until 2015 despite strong left-wing and right-wing tensions within the ruling coalition as the Senate votes to oust Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate.
In an interview with the newspaper La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he had "strongly intended" to continue to govern with his coalition until the upcoming 2015 legislative elections.
The Italian parliament’s upper house will meet in the course of the month to decide the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his resignation.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 last his refusal to give in to Berlusconi's injunctions that already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of shots.
Firefighters called at the scene of the tragedy said they had responded to a call saying they were "multiple wounded".
“Order forces are on the scene,” the airport said on its Twitter account, as television footage showed people evacuated in ambulances.
“There was a shooting,” a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
The local ABC antenna showed one person evacuated on a stretcher, and a second person transported on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9:30 a.m. local time (12:30 a.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, the airport said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that the 2nd and 3rd floors are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was not able to confirm immediately if one of its employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport have been suspended.
Israeli Army Kills Hamas Member in Gaza-Sec
Israeli tank fire killed a Palestinian Islamist militant from Hamas on Thursday and seriously injured another in the south of the Gaza Strip, health officials said, according to sources.
A Hamas source explained that fighting broke out in the area, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli military has only mentioned a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called a "terrorist" by the Jewish state, dug at the border and the discovery of which was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's Campaign Considered Dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event featured in the highly anticipated 2012 book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times obtained a copy of the book to appear and reported on Thursday evening that the president’s close associates had conducted “in-depth group work and surveys in late 2011” to see if Biden’s eviction could help Obama in his re-election as his hopes dwindled.
According to the Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House Secretary-General Bill Daley, aiming to measure the effect of replacing the vice president with the former secretary of state.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely kept within the Chicago Campaign GQ and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president – including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew the change was under consideration.
“Double Down” indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their “close personal ties,” before finally deciding against the change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list “would not significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I had looked at a whole series of questions, and that was one of them,” Daley told the paper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so they were like, “Lord, what can we do?”
While Daley called the “concert” review, Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to find out if the change would be beneficial in the election.
“Campaigns don’t spend a lot of money on surveys and discussion groups unless they seriously plan to take action,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is not known if Obama was aware that his team was considering the replacement.
Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time was aware of the possible refurbishment.
Although Daley said he did not think the president “was aware” of the eventual change, the former secretary general admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not definitively answer the question of whether the political polls had arrived at Obama’s office.
Cooper asked Martin if he thought seriously that Obama didn’t know Biden’s eviction from the presidential list was under consideration.
“Perhaps,” Martin replied.
Do you want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first jelly-based fluorescent ice.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the bright protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since the ice cream begins to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more it licks, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company “Lick Me I’m Delicious,” said: “It’s something incredible but we’re just starting out in terms of production, and 2g of this stuff costs around <0xC2><0xA3>200.”
The protein we use in ice reacts with the language at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice starts to shine.
We tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've created because the luminescence of the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimental approach society, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice-cream scents such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: “I would really like to develop an invisible ice.”
This is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of the jelly synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
“He died Sunday morning as he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his hands of musicians breaking the air,” writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their Springs (Long Island) home.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the last few years.
And even if we are citizens, it is our spiritual home.
“Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living that he had.”
Lou Reed had a liver transplant in May.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more of a penguin.
In the last two years, I have not distributed a single candy and I will certainly not do it again this year.
But the stats show that I'm the galley sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in candy, clothing and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is the trends.
Clothing is expected to represent $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy inanimate objects make you mad.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers, and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet the men in Daft Punk’s space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought after disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no harm in staying traditional.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, they weren’t the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on animal clothing this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of curious dogs dressed in hotdogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don't go overboard.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, juices, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go hunting for candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we’re going to buy and, let’s not tell ourselves stories, consume 41 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don’t want to eat; yet nearly 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery I haven't figured out yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They carry the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the U.S., which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and this includes these great photos of you pissing on you that your friends put on Facebook and that you can’t take away and on which one guy you like likes.
Finally, let’s talk about lemons.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped pumpkin is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve done since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the “baby pumpkin trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these pots and didn’t have to sit in them.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The light bulbs that grow on the porch of your home were probably from Illinois, where 542 million bulbs were grown this year.
If you’re looking to get more noticed, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try sculpting their 922 kg pumpkin.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will in-house create a “bad bank” structure of <0xC2><0xA3>38 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relationship with London and accelerate its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet by 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleared it over the next three years.
RBS also said it would file a provision for depreciating additional doubtful claims of four to 4.5 billion pounds over the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantoning structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free up <0xC2><0xA3>10 to <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion of capital, thereby strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London pointed out that the "bad bank" would make it possible to draw a line on the past, with the government in particular being accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
“We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a great bank for the customer and for the UK,” Ross McEwan, the new CEO, said in a statement.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior has 6-point harness seats and seat belts, as well as an Intercom system.
The options include improved brakes, a service that gives access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, the CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally fans who join Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced, some looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are confident that this will be a new way to try out different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of rallying raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is going to be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a career
Ruby, a Spanish cocker, had escaped after a serious road accident
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the career
Firefighters came down in recall along the cliff to retrieve the dog and save it from a certain death
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after firefighters were called to retrieve it safely while he was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable protrusion of a cliff.
Ruby, a nine-month-old Spanish cocker, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a career on Wednesday.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit’s career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and launched a call on social media sites after she disappeared in her career following a serious accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a person with a sharp view walking his dog spotted Ruby on a cornice in the quarry, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton's fire station rushed to the scene and came down in recall to save Ruby by using an animal cider to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical aid specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the summit and 15 m from the ground.
She did not move at all during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical aid specialist Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky to get out of it free of charge.”
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up; her general condition was satisfactory, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, of Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: “I was terrified to watch the rescue.”
At first I didn't think she was up there.
It was amazing to have him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firemen were stunned.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each one of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: “We were afraid that she would fall but she didn’t move.”
The firemen were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never dragged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a chorister on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, “He dragged me when I was 18.”
She added, “It was a long time ago, and it was very nice.”
In a statement Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70, said he “categorically denies making progress on Katy Perry.”
The representative added: "Perhaps she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, Prism, landed at number one on the charts this week.
Beijing calls into question a Turkmen Islamic movement
"Background support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," the Chinese security chief told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted online Thursday night on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (PCC), spoke in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a special organization after Monday’s attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same Muslim-dominant Xinjiang region, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with gas cans against the entry of the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two people and injured 40.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
Etim, which claims to fight for the independence of eastern Turkestan, former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the UN in 2002 among Al Qaeda affiliated organizations.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disturbances in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The outbreak of Europe gives choice to the Scots
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Trade Area in order to join the EU.
And here we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wires along Hadrian's wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper indicated the possible economic consequences of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not included in the headlines (and that was to be expected).
No one has said that EU Member States spend a large part of their time circumventing their formal rules when it arranges them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continuing non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from Scotland.
This is a story that is not one of them.
And such an ancient story that it is now fixed: I first heard the bobard that “independence means control of passports” more than 40 years ago.
Yet, an interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why trade the yoke of London against that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at the dead end.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, parties that oppose the EU or who are campaigning for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency gain ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections of September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal-Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the draft creation of a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the carcan weighing on national economies through the accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that are experiencing excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
The European system has instead put on its members favorable exchange rates for German exporters – which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe face an inherent problem of productivity vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper problem of productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German companies in the energy sector at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a cost-restrictive disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Not all wage gels in the world will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap US shale gas.
As a result, the revolt has become, especially in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy at a disadvantage.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s far-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, sending the socialists back to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot start from the principle that a split of the right will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year’s European elections to create a single and anti-European anti-money block within the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-currency sentiment in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like a free “Europe of Nations (sovereign)” favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will find their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to take its distance from this project, and I hope it will make its eyes soft in the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to account in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending out walks in Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a more free European agreement provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is – and should be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Labour Party.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Getting older earlier
Studies show that young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than young white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys.
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter’s breasts and pubic hair start growing at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pediatric endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are fairly common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty,” said Kaplowitz.
Obvious signs of development, such as breast budding, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has only been a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, while it was 12 years three-quarters in 1970.
“Once the breast has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years for the first rules to appear,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test for how puberty will evolve.
There is debate about what constitutes the actual appearance of puberty, but it is considered “early” when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – it’s something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution may justify tests performed by an endocrinologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and a small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the child's age, rate of development, rate of growth and affective maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with drugs but acknowledges that “controlling puberty can mitigate certain behavior problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young girls to have their own rules.
“They’re afraid of the risk of pregnancy or even the way they’re going to handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first rules at the age of 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about rules, it wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She returned from school scared and upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public’s attention about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no coherent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment, or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study conducted on girls aged 6 to 9 years that linked the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than young white girls.
There are several explanations.
On a global scale, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on the face and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls whose puberty is early should be reassured that, even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The tribute to the people of the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the French Cinematheque, had reflected the Golden Palm at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Not being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have thrown their spotlight on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the pop planet star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to be a accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, quits pop for folk music with a contagious retirement.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich allure in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less reluctant clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the sworn oath to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about a week of the tribulations of a folk singer who fails to pierce and gets angry with the whole earth.
He accepts to drop the foot replacements raised in the studios.
Without housing, he toured the sofas of his friends who still want to receive it.
An air of documentary
"His relationship with success is torturing us, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who's not there at the right time, who's not a careerist but integrated, with self-destructive behavior," said Ethan Coen, who was crowned with his brother Joel and several Oscars.
While Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two popular music fans built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk writes.
The film then takes on documentary looks, from the 33T’s invading dusty music label, inhabited by an unbeatable old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time, and to the cafés where the singers were performing.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by integrating a funny character that constantly traverses the film: a beautiful red cat with a cracking look, Llewyn Davis's companion of fortune.
Asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "grew up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country".
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar,” he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is needed to “be considered good,” “happiness can also launch someone’s career,” and “increasingly today.”
As Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to be caught up in anything that can stop us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", has died.
He never knew the word retirement.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died Thursday at the age of 83, just published his 200th SAS, "The Vengeance of the Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times called him "the author of espionage novels who knew too much."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theatre of the 198th and 199th opus of the famous spy novel series.
Declined physically by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was traveling on this journey with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, made sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first in the series, nearly half a century ago.
“No doubt between 120 and 150 million all countries are confused,” he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his immense apartment of a building on Foch Avenue, a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe, the evil eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which SAS's adventures were translated: Japanese, Japanese, Greek, allele
"Without counting pirate editions," he added, naming a pile of books on the low table between the bronzes or reported ivories of the 130 countries perched there to locate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous chest, carrying a gun or assault rifle.
Inside, his most serene highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a disorganized Austrian aristocrat and CIA contract agent to pay for the repairs of the family castle, launches himself into the trunks of all the bad guys of the land, communists of the 70s and 80s, then jihadists from the 90s.
At each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few hard sex scenes, a zest of violence and torture.
“I never claimed to be a literary author,” explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I don’t send a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, the Albert London type, who went on the scene and came back with real and long investigations."
SAS's father said "make a kind of geopolitical sheet".
“I am constantly my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before I leave,” Gérard de Villiers added.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those from AFP, diplomats, people from the services I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
Therefore, many of his SAS are often premonitory: thus, a month before the attack by a Syrian regime command center that killed several senior officials, he told the story in "The Road to Damascus".
In "The Madness of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a CIA secret command center in this city, the birthplace of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Cairo Plot", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists who were based on the Malian capital.
I’m not guessing, Gérard de Villiers defended himself, I just make assumptions from countries that I know well, and from time to time some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his IBM marguerite writing machine dating back to 1976 "of which all the pieces have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
On the walls of his office are hung AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcome in Africa where I have a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers once said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old."
He will not die and will not retire.
No more than me.
The aviators are arguing about the width of the seats while large orders are in play
The dispute rages between major aeronautical manufacturers over the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at Dubai’s airshow this month.
The conflict is about the width of the seats offered on long-haul flights to economy class passengers – which are not always the most frequented by airlines, but to which the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to set up a standard requiring a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its major U.S. rival Boeing says it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as the hijackers sought to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, possibly hoping for a record-breaking order at the event that will take place from November 17 to 21.
The way the seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, whether there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing says its redesigned 777X will be able to accommodate 406 people in economy class in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch-wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is calling it directly to the public ahead of Dubai’s aeronautical show, where the 777X is expected to take a step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
Recently, we were able to realize what could be the start of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled “Would you accept that?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus Commercial Director.
As eating habits change, people get fatter, but the seats in airplanes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing’s jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American’s weight from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the US Department of Health.
The average American size tower of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival clings to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the freshly named “jet set” was narrower.
Airbus added that it commissioned a study that indicated that an extra inch in seating width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing is contesting Airbus’ figures on seat width and says it’s not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also said that the study shows that the cabin experience does not just depend on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about bringing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their business,” said Kent Craver, who is in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don’t want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute lies a race for aircraft orders for an estimated at least $700 billion at market price in the coming decades, enough to make the balance of US and European exports tilt.
As Reuters first pointed out in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a per-seat performance in their latest long-haul twin-engine models 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in 9 rows.
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing is doing this in order to break down more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in terms of our products,” said Kevin Keniston, director of Confort Passenger at Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777s suggest that many passengers speak out in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
“An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Plane vendors who tour the world even take a metre with them to check the competing configurations.
While selling to offer comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for a greater personalization of cabins by offering wider side-by-side seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern large aircraft, experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aviation industry to set up a size standard for the seats will result, but that he could make forget about the sales wave of the 777X.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle’s shareholders voted Thursday against the proposed remuneration for founder and CEO Larry Ellison, in view of his group’s financial performance.
The vote is not binding but comes to tarnish the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just audible from his boat's victory at the America's Cup.
The billionaire still owns 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had a negative vote on his salary.
The boss of Oracle gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year closed in May due to the group's poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but he collected about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire year 2013, Oracle's net profit increased by 3.5% while the bond exchange rate of 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index which took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could eliminate the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine has been able to protect mice from nicotine dependence for life.
Other tests are needed before starting human trials, but Professor Ronald Crystal of New York's Weill Cornell Medical College said the first signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track all the nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from having his or her nicotine dose.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But mice that had not been vaccinated “were calmed down,” the researchers said, signaling that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines proved to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they won’t take any pleasure in it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and it can help them lose their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but reported that much more in-depth research was needed.
Pakistan's Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, security officials said.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the military, and the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in this strike, carried out in the North Waziristan region.
“We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike,” a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been held with the Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the movement of the Pakistani Taliban.
Tripodi not to be influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state’s anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing the trade lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeids own two restaurants and a coffee shop, after their expiration in August 2005, without any appeal.
It now investigates allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi's former Deputy Secretary-General, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government put pressure on the leases to be subject to a call for tenders.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay companies, which reported about $2.5 million a year to the Obeids, were renewed without a call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied changing his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to ICAC showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid's orders at the Ministry of Fisheries.
“Was the topic discussed during these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” said Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but anyway, it wasn't that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, says one official
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has conducted air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers with a 457 visa may have to pass a “authenticity” test
The government is currently studying the possibility of setting up an “authenticity” test for foreign workers holding a 457 visa as it plans to extend the measures of repression.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion intended to prevent visas 457 from being used to occupy unqualified positions or as a diversionary means to bring his family and friends to Australia.
A government working document was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government’s speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“Failing statements about ‘foreigners coming back at the end of the line’ and ‘jobs for Australians first’ are an unpleasant return at a time when unions were demanding a protected labor market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites had to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historic artifact.
The working document outlines the 12 measures that had previously been envisaged by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being under review.
If the “authenticity” criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to see “if the job offer is authentic in the event that the candidate is a personal relationship or partner of the owner or person concerned within the sponsoring company”.
Companies could also be required to declare the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man’s busy son, aged 9, was travelling to Australia with him and has found some comfort since his father’s death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study aimed at multiplying the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will begin as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project "would bring the United Kingdom together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “excited” to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of the duration of journeys to the north of England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travelling between Glasgow and Edinburgh for a maximum of three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is to build a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are huge.
Without it, we are faced with a problem of capacity of our railway network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to support “unambiguously” Scotland’s inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland’s economic weight in the overall high-speed rail network project across the UK.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British government to examine options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating an advantage for everyone and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
“I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps.”
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the U.S. move to ease regulations on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in “airplane” mode.
Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it painful not to be able to access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision that forces U.S. carriers to do important work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to immediately change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
“CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft,” she said.
The issue is subject to regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already told CASA of her intention to extend the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft,” a spokesman said.
Qantas said it is currently complying with the current rules.
“In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to immediately change that,” she said.
The FAA’s decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as reviewing manuals, training equipment, hand baggage transport programs and instructions provided to passengers.
“As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can authorize passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their devices during the landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stored under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: At least four wounded in violent fighting
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a group of about 30 people according to the testimony collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on Pia’s side where a rigging involving several people broke out on the Post’s side.
At least four minor injuries would be to be lamented.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore’s bail lenders take advantage of middle classes forced to tighten their belts
Janani Amirthalinga, a guarantor of the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay for her daughters’ tuition fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, became the third guaranteed loan company to be introduced on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Taking care of jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore’s guaranteed lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, grant lenders have the advantage of not requesting a solvency check or proof of pay, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to grant lenders while families feel the pressure from rising cost of living and over-indebted households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by overly lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to lenders on bail to fill the gap as their economies experience a slowdown.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s cited the growing household debt, mainly due to the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household/gross domestic product debt ratio in Asia.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The balance sheet is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the salary scale] are looking to supplement their income as they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have made people rush to gauge their personal effects to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the guaranteed items in the city-state’s 200 state-guaranteed lending shops are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's get the grandmother's gold chain in stock and we'll get it back next month."
In Thailand, EasyMoney, the largest provider of guaranteed lending stores, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The increase is such in the payday loan sector that ValueMax, operator of the store in Bendemeer and 15 other stores like this one in Singapore, plans to grow not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside of Asia, says Yea Lee Ching, its general manager.
The company will fund them using 60% of Singapore’s $66 million it raised this week at its introduction to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-interest lenders have exhausted criticism for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah points out that bailout offers not only lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
“Customers mortgage assets they already own, and monetizing their personal assets doesn’t increase household debt,” she says.
Guaranteeing is better and more socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed funding in the short term.
The people who go to the lenders on bail are also not just those who have financial problems.
People from Singapore also go to the ValueMax guarantee lending shops to guarantee gold ingots or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“It can be relief people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment activities, or small businesses that need cash to get through a difficult time,” adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
A pastor accused of child pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who was caring for young people in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist church in Timberlay, where the pastor was in office, is said to be deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials said Mr. Hudgins resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under 18 years of age and do not access the Internet.
He will appear in a provincial court in Halifax in December.
He went in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being chased away
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform with a brasard with the gamified cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, as customers complained to the management of the facility that called the police, the store said on Friday.
“We have received several complaints from customers, so we asked them to leave the store,” said a spokeswoman for supermarket chain Asda.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "the time she arrived, he was already gone without a break," she added.
I was making my tail when I saw a woman who looked upset.
People were mouth-to-mouth.
“You don’t get out on the street like that unless you want to get attention,” a 60-year-old client, Rosina Rusin, told Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, the day of Halloween, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a cannula.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
“I wear an SS black brasard twice a week for the past three years at Asda,” Dutton said, explaining suffering from “mental problems.”
$325 million rescue plan for the Tasmanian health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout plan for the vacillation health system is provided with strict conditions to ensure that the state government will not waste funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking “urgent measures” to end a crisis caused by the aging population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The funding, planned for 4 years, was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique difficulties facing the state,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
2,600 additional surgeries, particularly in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataracts, will help catch up with the delay.
Funding is also provided for clinics without appointments in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training of medical staff, mental health services, and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the idea that, according to frontline clinicians, this is the best way to treat the Tasmanian health system,” Plibersek said.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would be faced with a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient way possible.
Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much "unless they are followed by a real reform to consolidate Tasmania's public health system."
However, he congratulated the government for responding to the urgent aid request it submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing Tasmania’s public health system from the blacklist,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But health opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s announcement is a “solution of fortune.”
“The reason we’re here is that the state’s labor government has removed $430 million from its health care system,” he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a government of the state that pulls almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts 300 million dollars, and pretend it's a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar in the rescue plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a meticulous reconstruction of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in 1760s France, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Supreme Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never spills into lubricity or sensationalism, and that’s the problem.
The conscious solemnity of the narrative could also become a punishment for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says supervisory body
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and munitions filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are believed to be.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly 3 years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived with a day in advance on the deadline of
On 1 November, the Hague-based organization ordered Damascus to destroy or “make useless” all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing toxic gases and filling munitions.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the neurotoxic agent sarin.
The announcement was made as fighting raged in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
The group of activists, which tracks the evolution of the human record through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, there were an estimated 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the part of the government, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces have died, 18,678 of whom were pro-government forces fighters and 187 of Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Al-Assad’s troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to al-Qaeda groups in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting underscored the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they must complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a continuing civil war, in tight time.
A statement from the IOC, which works closely with the UN, said its team was “now satisfied with having controlled – and seen destroyed – all of the critical production declared and the machines intended for mixing and filling.”
She added that “no other inspection activity was planned at the moment.”
Earlier in the week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites because of concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the IOC said the two sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and ... that elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of two sites that IOC inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons which was approved the following month by the IOC Executive Committee.
“I salute the moral strength and courage that you all have shown as part of the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Ahmet Uzumcu, the organization’s director general, in a statement released by the IOC.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes Sunni Muslim rebels to the Assad government and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there had been a strong explosion Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger provoked by the sentence pronounced against one of Bali’s bomb posers
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the Bali bombings in 2002 reacted angrily to the sentence handed down against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should be shot by an execution platoon.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted men, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in manufacturing the explosive devices used in the attacks.
It could be released after 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder for the attacks targeting two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also found guilty of many other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of attacks targeting churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have applied for a life sentence, yet they could have asked that the man, who is known as “Demolition Man” for his reputation as a bomb-making expert, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
“He should be dragged in front of the execution platoon,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded into an outdoor parked van, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell asleep in the coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was “dead” three times while under respiratory assistance.
Hugues said Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of Jemaah Islamiyah’s terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
To keep him alive, why, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali’s bomb posers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for nearly 10 years but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces will kill al-Qaeda's former leader, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in order to re-establish links between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” added Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he was laughing outright at the grief he had caused to other people.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” said Ms. Corteen.
Patek, however, can appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board aircraft (but don’t make a call with their mobile phone)
Passengers from airlines will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phone – under the highly anticipated new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers shouldn’t expect immediate changes.
The speed at which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
The airlines will need to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of crew members and the rules regarding the storage of the aircraft to be compliant.
The FAA said it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Based on the plan, we could approve a widespread use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to relight them until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft when landing the aircraft before landing and not re-light them until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their devices during take-offs, landings and grounding, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was happy with the changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers to do so – it will be beneficial for everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like “room watchers” when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will need to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was loudly ejected from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be sorted because they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not the FAA.
FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered risky.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if they are used on board,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the problem recommended last month that the government authorize a wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on its use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.
The new airliners rely much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand FAA-approved electronic interference.
The airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruising altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems also better withstand interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only emit minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But the transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those who are pushing for a relief of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company’s executives loaded a Kindle e-book reader airliner and made it fly to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This inspired the FAA Advisory Committee members to feel mixed feelings about whether or not the use of the devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that the devices can interfere with the systems of an aircraft, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA authorize pilots to ask passengers to turn off their devices during instrument landings under low visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them meaningful arrangements for travelers equipped with technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A bird helicalized from a platform in the North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, helicalized after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, was released into the wild.
The water stream was raised on board a helicopter headed for Aberdeen last month before it was put back on foot by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa rescue centre.
The director of the center, Colin Seddon, said: “This water stream was probably a wintering migrant who came from northern Europe and was caught in the middle of violent winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil rig.
He added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to bring our help.”
The water stream was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing companies together and defining what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, companies and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all sizes of companies, sectors and regions in the UK.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want to see the government give priority to new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than entrenching itself in the long and hard process of reforming European institutional arcanes.
When asked for their opinion on specific policy points – from the regulation of monopolies to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that the control of these key skills should return to Westminster’s hands.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted to see Britain continue the initiatives in favour of a change in the treaty and the development of a trade-based relationship with the EU, not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all large groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the corporate world insists on a “significant change” that gives power back to the UK.
The stakes are high – to be able to change the treaty and better represent Britain’s interests would see a 16% turnout in favour of keeping the country in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan aimed at renegotiating the terms of Britain’s accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, since the euro area is committed to a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Great Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey show, for businesses, this means refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States in the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama has not deviated from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed treats to hundreds of invited children in the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween celebrations on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, however, the festivity has caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people took part in the parade held in the Greenwich Village neighborhood.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned last year.
We're having a lot of fun, Rhonda added.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated on the eve of the Toussaint, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says Bulgaria’s pipeline will inaugurate a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the director of Gazprom.
“A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest large-scale project in Europe,” said Alexei Miller, CEO of Gazprom, in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia’s export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart from Ukraine, which transits most of the Russian gas destined for Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director added.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into operation in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline has been designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world’s largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, the Tahiti News newspaper said on Thursday, resuming information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
The area is 47 km2, with three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the Bounty Mutants, an episode of the history of the English Navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen residents, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend on 95% of London’s generosity.
The Council of the island voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, which corresponds to its exclusive economic zone.
An assistant to the island’s mayor went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance of the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian EEA, near Pitcairn.
The FAA eases restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on board aircraft – but it will still be banned from making calls on mobile phones.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese vice-governor
A former deputy governor of Jilin province in northeastern China was sentenced to life in prison for corruption on Friday.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of touching more than 19 million yuan of pot-de-vin, Chinese official media reports.
Between 1995 and 2001, the vice-governor, who was also the president of the Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped businesses and those responsible obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, said the Beijing First Intermediate Court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "mushrooms" - the subaltern officials - only a handful of senior officials were convicted, including former executives of the oil giant PetroChina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of former CCP chief in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest functions within the state.
But the government has not expressed any intention to reform the anti-corruption system by, for example, creating an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing on the matter.
Two employees of the YMCA in New South Wales were charged with sexual assault against children following allegations made against Caringbah's educator, Jonathan Lord, in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said it had “never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization.”
Director-General Phillip Hare was questioned on two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a YMCA Caringbah Hall physical education monitor was found guilty of child sexual assault at the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel for the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate by pointing out, "External YMCA controls were carried out and indicated that child safety was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst assessments on four institutions during a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities conducted in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who started working at YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management had been a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of children's security policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failings toward child safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, that he kept them private, had them sit on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and had requested training on child protection because she was concerned about her behavior, said she found YMCA Caringbah’s child services manager, Jacqui Barnat, who would lead Lord “very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time.”
The Director-General said that he rejected the testimony of the staff that they were reluctant to report these shortcomings to their senior hierarchical superior.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they had with Lord blurred their judgment, which made them not report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his point of view before the YMCA board of New South Wales saying that, for the organization, the lesson drawn from the “Jonathan Lord incident” should not concern “the report” by staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have confidentiality agreements signed by staff, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by YMCA Director General for Child Services Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that it had been misimplemented.
The YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, i.e. between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on child sexual violence, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20th.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become prime minister again, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old made his opinion known about various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Special Envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to be Prime Minister again, Blair would have replied, according to London’s Evening Standard, “Yes, of course, but it’s likely to happen, so...”
When many experts at equestrian events gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old child, win.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee raced through the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparables – who are of the same size – were hailed for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank equestrian centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against elegant men and women in melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on the side casually to parade his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was hailed by the judges for his unusual natural dressing qualities for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good grades for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has been training since then with his Shetland pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee make an excellent duo.”
They presented themselves to and against all, but the two reflected the gold cut and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were madly glad he won.
On the track, people who didn’t know him thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to get photographed with him.
This young boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “There was electricity in the air and everyone was encouraging and applauding it.”
He walked the entire length of the track running and even though he seemed very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way he started, he’ll surely be participating in the Horse of the Year event soon – and I’m sure he’ll make a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian rally said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony.”
They make a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee performed well and the way they walked on the track.
They are looking for effective team work between the pony and the coach – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he had really proud looks.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "will be remanded"
A Chinese newspaper that launched a front-page call for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be remanded, a press regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based New Express has issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted to television that he had accepted wine cans to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will undergo a “complete overhaul,” the regulator said.
The order of “recast” comes from the Guangdong administration for the Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles on the company listed Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The drafting of New Express was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card.”
He also ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a full refurbishment of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the people responsible at New Express and immediately refurbish the newspaper’s management team.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express about the alleged financial irregularities of a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice issued a front-page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to publishing false stories against money.
“In this case, I hurt Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence,” he told public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I ran after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express released his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly verified his articles.
A number of prominent suspects have recently made television announcements.
Experts say people are systematically forced to make their statements, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier in the year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is on board.
The radioactive steam leak detected on one of Charles-de-Gaulle's two nuclear boilers, in mid-October and while the ship was at sea, was "no danger to sailors", but was not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royale has just confirmed to us the "unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, a defense ship specialist, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "are currently intervening on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failing heater.
"Everything is being implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013," DCNS said.
And the National Navy certifies that "it does not in any way challenge the ship's program of activity" to nuclear propulsion.
Let us recall that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier departs from a six-month intermediate maintenance period.
He had equipped Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, in order to qualify young hunting pilots.
A "little disaster", confined to the reactor's containment space, had then occurred on the admiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a strong dissatisfaction on the part of the people I meet: monstrous reassessment of their properties, tax outflow, the cost of all kinds of permits, administrative costs to not end there.
In short, unlimited syphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be saved to allow a very respectful tax on those who pay.
Any money forcibly removed from taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, one does not mind about sumptuous expenses and the maintenance of boxed ducks: deficit cultural center, strong subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they are sold to the private enterprise or demolished.
It is also sad to see the expropriation of several properties in order to host a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honorable mention to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost for tax payers?
It is not the public level to invest in such companies, but the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens have been pleased to learn that the fishing lakes and piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the large decline of the population, water use has decreased considerably throughout the territory.
Without wasting it, the city will never lack water and the harsh regulations regarding its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is quite easy to accomplish great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by tiebreakers with beautiful diplomas for the most part and I don’t think a sheep breeder gets any worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the U.S. and Mexico with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
U.S. authorities have described the 4-foot-by-3 tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever seen.
The tunnel, zig-zagging over a length equivalent to nearly six long football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, United States.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, which makes it easy to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs emerged as they passed unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were accused of possessing marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They face a prison sentence of 10 years to life imprisonment if they are sentenced to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railroads that started from the kitchen of a Tijuana house and went up to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police hand over extradition warrant against Assange <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
The British police have today issued a extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and has sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a "resignation notice" against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would authorize his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender to a 40-year-old man who asked him to appear at a police station on the date and time of his choice," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release under bail.
The Embassy declined to comment on the release of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of spying, after revealing more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting secret information.
How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
Have you finished typing passwords to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, even believes that “the century will be biometric”.
Only biometrics will make it possible to ensure the identity of a person making transactions in a universe as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
Only in 2011 and in France, the National Commission for Computer Science and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
“Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime,” said Justin Brookman, consumer privacy officer at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will make it possible to provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, hand contours and the venous network of palms or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
“For example, some people who work on concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable,” said Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity field at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand imply a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a security - one cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure sometimes has to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted for about twenty years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of the sensors and the computing capacity of the computers necessary for the analysis of the data, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten in the last five years, according to Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture’s R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but it takes a quiet environment,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
A unique and infallible marker, DNA also evokes hopes and concerns.
“In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data,” confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers the judicial police services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in one hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognise one person among others) and authentication (ensure that the person is what they claim to be).
To date, identification has concerned the issue of identity papers: biometric elements (prints, photos, iris) must be compared with the information that the State has on all citizens already registered.
This ensures that a person does not try to usurp someone else’s identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance to a hotel or store.
“We recover images from surveillance cameras and compare them with photos of celebrities who are freely circulating on the Internet,” said Dany Nassif, director of commercial development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Another use: take a photo of a quidam that makes its tail in a store, track its progression through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logic (opening a computer).
More recently, the control of presence has been added.
“A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend who points for another,” explains Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from certain distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the hit of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoul<0xC3><0xAA>me by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and signs of the big distribution: when paying in-store with his bank card, the customer does not type his code, but inserts his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
“If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in cash for thirty seconds less, that’s appreciable,” explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect the databases.
“Digital fingerprints are stored on a first server; people’s identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is blocked if you try to move it,” said Philippe Robin of Thales.
But, in the absence of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
The privacy experts, they, continue to worry about.
“The advances in facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras, and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr, or Picasa scare me the worst: widespread surveillance,” said Andrew Patrick, Canada’s Privacy Commissioner.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000
A motorist was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink placed in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree in Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to be taken between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the misconduct without the caution and attention required.
The seven points removed from his permit led to a 6-month permit withdrawal.
Howie was also sentenced to pay <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a <0xC2><0xA3>100 victim surcharge.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to blow up the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally encrypted the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision by Mr. Osborne who, in the 2012 budget, has entered a 7% stamp duty for properties costing more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual fees for individual buyers who choose to own properties in the framework of a corporation.
The stamp duty already applies to the residential properties of the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, and represents <0xC2><0xA3>708 million for fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North Yorkshire and the West Yorkshire region.
Mr. Cook stated, "Following the increase in the stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law in the matter, it is very difficult to advance that high-value properties are under-taxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prestigious real estate – the 5 to 10 percent of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the thriving sector in south-west London stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London show regular year-on-year growth of 5.6% but have been eclipsed by a growing "internal market", the southwest of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experiencing a rebound, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog’s tail are related to its mood.
Previous studies have shown that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs move it more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: “Everyone knows that in humans, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions.”
Here, we tried to see what it was like with other species.
He added that just like in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To find out more about how dogs react to the disordered tail movements of other dogs, the researchers followed animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We introduced dogs to films that featured other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factor – and we were able to traffic the movement of the tail and present it as going further left or right.”
When the animals saw an expressionless dog move the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog moving the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they noticed a tail drifting mainly to the left (again from the dog’s point of view moving the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements that they should or should not worry about.
He added: “If you meet several times other dogs and you notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react based on that experience.”
The researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The canine behavioral expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol School of Veterinary Sciences, said it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs were more likely to go to a robot dog when its tail was going to the left rather than to the right, instead of getting anxious – the opposite of what is found in the Italian study.”
He said the differences could come from the fact that the dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
“Although many elements, detected in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will surely not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys Announces Concert in Glasgow Due to Alex Turner's Disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a concert in Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed to its singer.
Sheffield's band was due to perform on Friday in The Hydro concert hall in downtown.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the band was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show to the Hydro of Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
“Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the show at the Hydro in Glasgow will take place on 21 November.

Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest churchmen placed in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will name his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – so this goes back to a group of 120 “cardinal electors”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting bringing together all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will likely have decreased.
He stated that a pope generally appointed as many cardinals as he needed so that the number of electors would reach 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
The consistory of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with examining ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided on his own.
“From now on, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He added that it was “completely possible” for Francis to seek advice from the cardinals.
But we’ve never experienced such a situation – it’s totally new.
Valero said the popes generally raised bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will name.”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the U.S. to repair the seat case
General Motors Co. recalls nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to fix a problem with tiltable cases manually, according to a statement Friday by the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could present a fault at the level of the tilt mechanism.
As a result, the files do not comply with federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
“If the vehicle is hit by the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury,” according to a statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The rollout of GM pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the first U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the pick-up owners of the defect during the first 15 October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the information letter to the owners due to the 16-day shutdown of government activities, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM’s stock price rose 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under blocks of concrete
A construction worker died buried under dozens of blocks of concrete on Thursday morning in Montreal.
The drama took place around 11 a.m., on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie district.
It is likely that work on the foundations has been taking place at this place for some time.
A mythical foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim had just arrived at the site in order to recover his tools.
I was driving and I saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke,” said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I landed and I went to remove the big bricks that would cover it.
We only saw a part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to authorities, the victim is a 50-year-old man who worked for a coffering company.
Reanimation manoeuvres have been attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Commission on Health and Safety at Work was sent to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding the tragedy.
The Cry of Despair by an Obama Voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says Obama has made commendable efforts mocked by the Republican Party's obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor drone attacks
The memory of Obama’s 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading an awfully sad book these days.
This is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the laziness of the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope again.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win,” and it’s reminiscent of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening and I fell asleep, this book takes me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and where speeches could cut your breath.
The election ended with a crushing victory and the presenters of the news newspapers took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was moving towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the Obama transition period before taking office in 2008, he had 82% of favorable views.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it is like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of our army from Iraq, to the end of the “never seen nor known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the field of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after having repeatedly defended the Obama administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the verge of political despair.
The republican obstruction cannot explain the listening of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the prosecution of whistleblowers who reveal the government’s faults.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without trial, or the evasion of public funding and overspending allowed during presidential campaigns.
She cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above appear to be largely the choice of the administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that did not seem to allow him to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term, being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises he had been hearing about for so long.
Yet, while the favorable opinion index has dipped below 45% this week, it is even harder to go back to 2008 through this book.
It makes me want the many promises that have gone away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses in favor of Clinton at the Pennsylvania Primary.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
“I want us to focus on our talent,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
We are five years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris only.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The driver, Jonathan, 26, of Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the rescuers, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who disputes the payment of a carbon tax of $6 million, argued this argument in an attempt to rule out issues related to a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to personally benefit from these policies.
“He will have a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a refurbishment of the suffrage disposal system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why can’t we have a system where you can log in, enter your contact information into a computer, vote immediately, and have the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it possible to delete the result if someone does not agree?
Nowadays, having a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has looked at the possible options for electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions "very seriously".
The exercise of public office is a matter of public service.
“We’re not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York has identified a new species of bush dolphin off Australia’s northern coast.
Thibaut Bouveroux, head of scientific mission at the Observatory for Conservation and the Study of Marine Animals and Environment (OCEAMM), returns to L'Express for this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Are you surprised by the discovery of this new species of bush dolphin?
That's good news, but that's not particularly surprising to me.
If in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge of the science of species classification.
Moreover, it is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are challenged because of the advances in genetics.
In the same way, two very close species were distinguished morphologically by genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific bush dolphins and the Atlantic bush whales.
Recent analyses have made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is it a discovery of importance, as claimed by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had long been known by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered depending on the number of individuals existing on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility that it has to recover from neighboring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new species discovered has emerged, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene brazing limits the creation of new species.
On the contrary, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It is important to know that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
It is preferable to send robots to Mars, than to know what lives in the Mariana cave, only 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money on the search for life on other planets than on marine research and it’s time for that to change.
RBS suspends two traders in the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division according to two sources close to the file, which again shows that the global regulators’ investigation into currency market manipulation suspects is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperated with regulators as part of investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where US$5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the Libor interbank rate manipulation scandal.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this case is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file said that RBS had transmitted instant e-mail and message files, sent to and by a former trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is said to have been suspended from his position as European Account Manager for Currency Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Citi’s European head of cash currency trading, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, Barclays and UBS’s senior currency trader, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any crime.
Mr. Usher’s file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file added.
UBS explained this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, said it was investigating suspicions of currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Around the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations made regarding bankers who would have been heard to manipulate rates on the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the file said.
Banks use instant messages and emails sent over the years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
The news about these investigations has shaken traders into an industry that has been one of the biggest drivers of growth in investment banking trading units in recent years, but which has been challenged this year due to the low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market of highly liquid currencies, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to begin to have an impact on the market at little.
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had returned a trader working in its London Stock Exchange-traded fund office this week after it caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was mastered,” said a representative of Credit Suisse.
Mayor Rob Ford's investigation has been stalled, a lawyer says
After the police confirmed that they had handed over a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby said he had never seen an investigation “so messed up.”
Ruby told The Canadian Press she believed the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford’s friend and occasional driver, 35-year-old Alexander Lisi, and charged him with video extortion.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they had also observed the man delivering packages to Rob Ford, according to new court documents.
Ruby called the police “inexplicable” the fact that the police never searched Rob Ford’s vehicle or his home, or put on his phone, arguing that Chief of Police Bill Blair chose in knowledge of the cause not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford’s vehicle, arrested the mayor, and conducted a search – even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if it deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Mr. Ruby’s remarks “a clear and desperate attempt” to sue the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
In a press conference on Thursday, Blair said there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Stock Exchanges Declined in Half Session, Except London
With the exception of London, major European Stock Exchanges are trending downwards Friday at mid-sentence, plunged by some news from disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious as they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could unravel its quantitative easing policy earlier than expected.
On the contrary, after the announcement of 0.7% inflation for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spreading among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
Wall Street’s futures are predicting an opening up of U.S. stocks up, after two consecutive retreat sessions.
At values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest return of the CAC 40, plunged by the result warning from its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, having also published declining results this morning and announced the in-house creation of a default structure ("bad bank") comprising 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the forefront of the EuroFirst300 surges in response to press reports that AT&T is considering a possible OPA.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation about the ECB’s monetary policy evolution is going well, as John Hardy, Saxo Bank strategist, testified.
The ECB’s unique mandate has always been about inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at next week’s meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the euro to fall.
In this context, the euro continues its withdrawal against the US currency and hit a two-week low at $1.3517.
These same assumptions, on the other hand, support the euro area’s bond market.
Supreme Court Approves Obama's Health System Reform Law
A big victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared that the health care system reform law ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, under penalty of having to pay a fine – and declared it constitutional under the government’s tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, rallied to the four most liberal members of the Court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page law and considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered under the penalty of losing all federal funding under the program, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates in the running presidential election during the 2012 primaries, including nominee Mitt Romney, fiercely opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute paid to the former fighters in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute to soldiers and the dead of all wars this Friday afternoon.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by the deputy mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Hanging between Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday, October 31, 2013 at night during a violent hanging at the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory in a year.
The Gaza Strip’s only power plant ceased to operate on Friday, Nov. 1, after its fuel stocks were depleted, the Palestinian Enclave’s Energy Authority said.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another member of the Hamas military branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank fire during an Israeli army raid east of Khan Youn<0xC3><0xA8>s Medical Base, in the southern part of the city.
Two other local officials from the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were later discovered.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made a one-hundred-meter incursion into the territory before retreating.
The fighting lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had died during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell while defending the territory during an invasion of the Zionist occupier in Khan Youn<0xC3><0xA8>s.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman said.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the army, for “terrorist activities.”
Hamas has claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the goal was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device targeting the forces of the Isra<0xC3><0xAB>l (Israeli army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," Army spokesman Peter Lerner said in a statement.
In addition, Israel struck an air force base in northwestern Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles aimed at the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah movement, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel reported on Thursday.
A US official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but did not give details about the target.
“In the past, targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah,” he added.
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that she did not name, the Saudi capital chain said that "the bombing targeted a cargo of ground-to-air missiles that was intended for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard Wednesday at dawn at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattaquié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization based on a network of activists and medical sources had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Return in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents to Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inhaled by the famous piano solos Gymnopédies de Satie.
An evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from black to white ink.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, forwards, profile, end like a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes its form.
And this form will be that of the whole room: a thread of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face uncovered, wait on either side of the playing area, rush when the next graph appears, embody it, emerge in the stream.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is performed in solo relays, in group at the junction (a mass that makes solo), in large group of twelve solos where each executes his sign.
We think of "Morning Glory", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, put online at the foreground.
This is the same principle, the giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is strong, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance carpet, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux's poem, monocorde and monotone in the cry, and will continue to dance.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to go back.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up deafening and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - like those hair that crumbles or those black fabrics that stretch the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to the meeting of Michaux's work, has imposed himself, with his tics.
The result: the bodies look flat in front of the drawings.
The inks of Michaux, as forms of Gestalt, open up a wider and more gibbous imaginary than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in the negative, with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches the magic.
The public loved it, the reception was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the entract, are richer.
The stage is partly draped in gray, the dancers and a piano are covered in fabrics, like furniture in an abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers reunite to play the scores.
Their music misdirections, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, couples pass, in loving duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
Boutons appear, also familiar to Chouinard, with a red nose, in very polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnivores, fugitives or players.
The gesture, laughter and small cries beautifully translate the archaic, grace and ridicule of the coyote bodies, the melting beings.
But the room takes its true flight after salvation.
A clown returns to the scene when the public leaves.
There, everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the caboten dancers descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness perpetuate, and it is the art of Chouinard, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are the subject of lawsuits over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, began an avalanche of lawsuits over patents on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it shoved at the post office when it auctioned the patents that took place after Nortel’s bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. Court of Appeals in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that make it possible to display advertising in connection with Internet search terms, the trial’s findings, which is the core of Google’s business.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that run under Google’s Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, to finally offer $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market partly based on Motorola’s patent library.
“Although it failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, Google has violated and continues to violate those patents,” the court said in a statement.
Rockstar claims more significant damages and interests against Google, as it claims that Google’s patent infringement is persistent, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater that caused the explosion
The grandmother allegedly lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which sustained two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a faulty water heater, the King's deputy said on Friday evening.
The expert dispatched on site by the prosecutor ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a gas buildup.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is always engaged.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and companion, was by his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the spot before being taken to the CHU in Li<0xC3><0xA8>ge, she was in a helicopter, she was in an ambulance," Mayor José Paulet said.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Healthy and except, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase that remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
The firemen of Andenne and Namur and the police of the Arches intervened.
The civil protection of Crisnée stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks first freely elected president to swear an oath
Mohamed Morsi has pledged to invest, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he pledged to invest in the presidency, becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was overthrown 16 months earlier.
During his investment before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He took an oath before the 18 judges in black court dress whose building on the banks of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
“We are looking forward to a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” President Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered hard-working for more than 84 years.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to applaud the new president and, standing out from the presidential fast of the Mubarak years, the circulation was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy into the busy streets connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered to be the uncharismatic “relief wheel” of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased considerably since his victory and his Friday speech during which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun at the 2011 uprising against the Mo'erak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges present in the wooded room where he took oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he delivered his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem while he was watching you.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The People and the Army, hand in hand...", sung by thousands of people gathered in the university's grand amphitheater.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fief of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath Friday on Tahrir Square, from which the uprising that ended last year’s Mubarak authoritarian regime began, and vowed to reclaim the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the former president-elect, has deposed.
But by agreeing to formally swear before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is in use, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi’s speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
Shutdown in the U.S. has slowed the growth of the auto market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal governments weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, show figures released Friday by manufacturers, five of the top six having achieved lower-than-expected performance.
Detroit’s three major automakers posted double-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts expected on average 15.4 million annualized and adjusted sales of seasonal variations but the market stood at 15.3 million according to estimates by Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley analyst.
In a note to the bank’s customers, he believes that this slight breakout is primarily due to the government’s “shutdown” and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first 15 months of the month.
GM, however, reported a nearly 16% increase in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, up from 211,563 expected by the consensus.
The group’s four brands saw their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pickups, saw its sales increase from 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194,301.
For its part, Fiat-controlled Chrysler has announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, up from 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also posted lower-consensus sales, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM's stock earned 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford ceded 1.1%.
Renault plunges into stock market with Nissan warning
Renault accuses Friday of the sharpest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced it had reduced its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20%, traders report.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a reshuffle of its management.
Several traders reported that the Renault stock was affected this morning by the "warning".
“This is clearly Nissan’s profit warning,” said a Parisian broker’s trade official.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan’s capital and the Japanese manufacturer owns 15% of French, according to data from Nissan’s website.
Greece: Two dead in shooting near a neo-Nazi party site
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by gunshots fired by two people who were on board a motorcycle passing in front of a local of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party in the western suburb of Athens, a police source said.
The police were not able at the time to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had claimed that the victims were guards of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers from the anti-terrorist service rushed to the central avenue of the suburb of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident comes a few weeks after six Golden Dawn MPs, including the party's leader and founder, were charged with participating in a "criminal organization" as part of an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Celtic Glasgow captain Scott Brown has seen his call rejected and will be well suspended for his club’s next two Champions League matches against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a for sending a blow to Neymar, the Scottish midfielder saw his extended suspension at three meetings by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed", believing that his call was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes are deprived of electricity across the province, shortly after noon Friday, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the dark, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The great region of Montreal is also experiencing its share of breakdowns with nearly 7,000 private power homes in the metropolis and in Laval.
Do you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its upward net profit forecasts and hopes for record results thanks to vacationers from Australia and the UK.
The travel agency is now expected to make an underlying profit over the entire fiscal period of $325 to $340 million before taxes, compared with a previous forecast of $305 to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
Director-General Graham Turner said Flight Centre had made 8% of profits in the first half and that the second half had begun in force, particularly with regard to non-business travel in Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and many of them are well on track to achieve record results across the entire fiscal year before interest and tax deductions,” he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the biggest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, making it possible to offset a domestic business travel market in slight decline.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre’s leisure travel sector has seen good results, while business customers have spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year where seasonal demand is lower and was expected to profit on the whole of the year for the third consecutive time.
The shares of Flight Centre increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown shoots at hotel near Cairo pyramids
Unscathed unknowns opened fire on Friday at a hotel near the Cairo Pyramids in Egypt without making any casualties as a result of an apparent dispute with laid-off employees.
The assailants fled, police general Abdel Latif, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said.
The attack comes as Egypt no longer receives almost any tourists since the army dismissed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and represses in the blood the demonstrations of its supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on maths, spelling, and grammar.
As part of the English literature courses, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a nineteenth-century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also feature “new texts” to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be removed.
Starting in 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and Math programs tomorrow – the first materials to undergo a radical revision.
It will bring about changes in other key areas next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Examinations Regulatory Bureau, will unveil a refurbishment of the CSE structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was "a broad consensus as to the need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence", insisting that the CSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singapore students do about 138 hours.
While there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to maths, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of in-depth maths – as well as the greater importance given to the subjects listed in the international rankings – would encourage the more likely ones to be encouraged.
The programme will focus more on "real-world problems", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law passed in July in that State and which raises a great deal of questions about the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
Octogenarian welcomes children with a gun at Muy for Halloween
The 9- and 13-year-olds were knocking on the door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the area visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old explained to the gendarmes that he was afraid.
His weapon was seized.
The former head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever finding his trace, was actually buried in a common grave of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the Memorial of the German Resistance, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
M<0xC3><0xBC>ller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a common grave of the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte," he said, according to the daily newspaper, based on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime, would answer one of the great riddles of the post-war period.
The German secret services, the BND, provided as well as during the summer of 1949, M<0xC3><0xBC>ller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were totally wrong.
“Since August 1945, M<0xC3><0xBC>ller’s body has been found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando,” Tuchel said.
He was wearing a "general's uniform."
“In the left inner pocket were in particular its service states with a photo,” he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the district town hall of Mitte in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the neighborhood.
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is a huge amount of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is grossly crowded," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich M<0xC3><0xBC>ller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich who has never been captured.
He attended the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, condemned to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

He walks in the mud, the jungle and crosses rivers to offer free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost all their weekends seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this country of West Africa, just 1 in 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, to elect “CNN Heroes of the Year.”
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alter periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he was going to carry with him the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could benefit from.
“It’s not easy,” adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr. Bwelle’s father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
By comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians would not be able to pay the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health spending is in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Dr. Bwelle explained.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed more than 700 free surgeries over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they stumble into vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and crossing difficult terrain to get to the villages that need the most help.
Luck doesn’t always follow them.
They have repeatedly had to push vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dance and offers them the best accommodations available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began to receive hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people on each visit,” Bwelle said.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this itinerant hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive bills, a collected pair of glasses, or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply can’t afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team practice simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually performed in a school, a town hall or a house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the waking room to leave his or her place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the power group, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It’s an exciting pace, but the musicians in the villages generally help the team stay motivated.
“They hit drums all night long to keep us awake so we can keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has practiced 700 surgeries for free over the past year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
“It’s going to change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to bringing this traveling hospital to life and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
This is the second job, he explains, which finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Dr. Bwelle’s group.
He’s always in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O’Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, it’s an opportunity to learn on the ground that they don’t have at home.
“We were able to participate in operations to help wean the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley said.
It’s not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you’re a medical student in your second year.
Volunteers generally pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical supplies.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transportation and education are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt,” O’Malley said.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not nearly extinguished.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others to live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle added.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons that push me to do this.

The Two Frances by Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheaters and classrooms?
Undoubtedly, but by emphasizing its weakness for the paths of crossing, Sciences-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitrator of the works of others in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Heir of the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the Académie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise?
True, but knowing that such a sacred can not replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which has passed.
They gladly recognized him as a great awakener, animator and a federator of their work, but by noting that he showed little inclination to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image, the monument of the "Places of Memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The evil languages were able to see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a keen eye and erudition, but uncurably dilettant.
The two books published by Nora soon two years ago have already established that the one who went to not write had much and well written.
The book here should definitely do him justice.
There, however, we find, once again, the temptation of ubiquity, the intellectual vagabondage, the jubilation set to jump as on foot joined by one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book in such a beautiful title bring the brochanter back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive knot of French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: This is a concern of the time.
A short time ago, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders back then, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that tracks Pierre Nora is different.
He does not inherit an eternal franchisor, he refuses to define himself.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders into a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by an object in the form of a broom, tormented by irritating questions.
This one, which is born of the enterprise itself: why, in a country so permanently settled within its borders, so once so charpent and solidly Masonic, do these dramatic calls to unity be heard?
They are only so pressing, Pierre Nora suggests, only to conjure up the disorder born of the discords of French history.
Francs and Gauls, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division, here, are very ancient.
And the most emblematic is, of course, the one that breaks national history in two.
As of the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without being able to deny it; on the contrary, she was anxious to find the sacredness of it and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility that she had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincible binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make this uniqueness of French identity felt, nothing is worth the four steps out of the Hexagon, so that the American escape of Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have each made a revolution, written a declaration of rights, wanted to establish a new society.
But the American cousing only makes it better to emphasize what is our own.
There were men there who had left their former regime in England and had no more to worry about.
Here, men buried in an ancient indigenous regime, and all the more radical.
There is a consensual revolution when here it has sown drama and confection.
There are ever-honored founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors whose models are hard to model, and who have intermarried.
There is an institutional consistency, and here there is a cascade of constitutions, as well as so many mistakes to catch up with and attempts to take back.
The France that goes, the France that comes
There was, however, a time when the French believed they could pick up the torn dress from their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
In this Third Republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a lot of interest and even tenderness: welcoming those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolchildren everything that in ancient France was darkly preparing modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity has only been around for a while.
The issue is once again being debated, driven by immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that goes away and the circumspect sketch of France that comes.
With, in premium, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
We found out that the path was a housewife.
The man of multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The ridge was in the center of the center.
And the one who had deposited, here more than half a century, a subject on the idea of nation, but had abstained from the initial exercise of the thesis, confides to us, cum grano salis, that he will have done it.
Certainly in a less rigid, more brittle and more subtle form.
But don’t get me wrong, just as compelling.
For far more than the figure imposed by the university course, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Removed in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team coming to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in the creation in 2004 of the association for the defense of the hostages "Otage of the World", which he has presided over for several years.
Its main objective: to obtain the possibility for hostages to file a complaint and to bring their hostage takers to the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Gr<0xC3><0xA2>ce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, gradually, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, a former major reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde".
From the evening of your release, you were on the stage of the 20h of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
In particular, in Beirut.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's black - Roger Auque.
He tells me "we're released," but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very tense as well.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They're putting us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the website of the Summerland hotel where the press is present.
The French bring us to the Embassy of France.
It's time for the first wiretaps to the parents, the family, the friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in t-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night to talk to Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did you arrive on French soil?
We're landing at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's kind of brutal.
There's an incredible twist.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I'll be back and there's plenty of it.
The descent of the plane ladder, the reunions with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and me, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The motorcyclists pull the plug to take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do some police work to keep some from going up.
The media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're suddenly under the media lights.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the hardest.
The same evening, I'm at 8pm, the next day I'm also on TV.
Then start some sort of rehabilitation to life, very gently, for a month or two that are a bit like a vacation.
How did the medical examinations and the debriefing DGSE take place?
I was entitled to a first medical check in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grace the following days my return: radios, exams of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can count on it, remember it if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
This is part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about hostage takers.
That was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the liberation of the four hostages of Niger?
I'm listening to what you're saying.
The debate on ranches in particular.
Some things annoy me, others less.
I’m trying to share things between the questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as president of the “Otage of the World” association that allows me to distance myself, and I find it much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there is a semantic problem.
It is necessary to describe the taking of hostages as "political" hostages - as is the case most of the time - and to allow the hostages to have access to justice, to file a complaint and to bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might have access to justice as well?
A court in The Hague is made for this.
Why not say to hostage-takers, "You have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva Conventions, we will bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, well founded, legitimate, struck with common sense.
This message is heard, but not heard, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi trial
The anger deepens in the ranks of the Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of deposed President Mohamed Morsi, they went down the streets.
A mobilization across Egypt to demand the restoration of the country’s first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, this activist from the Muslim Brotherhood points out.
So far, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial that arises a pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to judge Sisi, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses 9 U.S. states of violating gay rights
Since the federal state recognized same-sex marriage, “all military spouses are entitled to an ID card from the Department of Defense and the benefits that come with it,” the minister recalled in New York in a speech before the Anti-Defamation League to fight anti-Semitism.
“But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities,” he denounced, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defense said he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The slum of the nine states began with Texas refusing to implement these services on the Texas National Guard's premises, due to a conflict between Texas law and federal gay marriage law.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population affected by the recognition of same-sex marriage to approximately 5,600 active people, including the National Guard, the reserve and pensions.

Toronto Mayor Chases Journalists Who Asked Him About A Drug Affair
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drugging, according to several media outlets.
A video released to the court appears to support these suspicions.
The person, Rob Ford, has always denied having eaten crack, while acknowledging having a hangover for cannabis.
On Thursday, he fired several journalists from his property who came to question him.
We also think that sometimes the images do not need explanation or comment.
A case of rage detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced on Thursday that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, apparently of foreign origin while France has been free from indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on 25 October in Argenteuil and died on 28 October.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been undertaken to identify and support people who may have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 inclusive," the health and agriculture ministries said in a statement.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
The ministries now call on people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucosa or on a skin injured by the kitten or whose animal has been in contact with the kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact the 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
“As France has been free of rage since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not free,” the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded "indigenous" case of rabies dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France is declared officially free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Bureau of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from the Gambia was recorded in 2008.
“Rage is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time,” the ministries remind, and it is transmissible for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama steps back on health care reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday on his promise unambiguously and often repeated that “if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president over the past few days by accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls “an effervescence in the news” about the terminations, President Obama urged Americans who received these opinions to seek new insurance on the market.
Most people will be able to get complete and better-suited health plans for the same price, or even for even less than expected.
“You’re going to win,” he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5% of the population who self-insured themselves were forced to change their regime because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better,” Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement to the Washington Energy and Trade Commission.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the October launch of the online market had “sadly failed.”
“I’m as frustrated and annoyed as anyone,” she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this phrase, as she believed her micro-cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's Assembly meeting following an exchange of contentious views with Billy Long, representing her republican
For more than three hours, Billy Long continued to insist on asking Ms. Sebelius why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to subscribe to a diet via HealthCare.gov, which she now sells to millions.
Vettel tightens a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky man, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the German brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the track level.
German four-time Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel trained for free trials at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday for a special helmet designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen among 1,500 drawings sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, an automotive brand, of its team.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can therefore see closely the German champion, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet Friday and Saturday for rehearsals.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet for the race on Sunday, destined to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party of the suburbs
Above all, don't get me wrong.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the suburbs" is not only aimed at the suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of exile, I address myself to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
His project, presented on Thursday at a press conference in his hometown of Aubervilliers, was born of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great melting pot of culture that characterizes above all neighborhoods.
My proposal No. 1 is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, territorially attached, today claims to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left, but if the right-wing people are willing to support me, I will listen to them too, he continues.
There are only extremist parties I’m not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program -consultable on the Internet - from many topics intended to speak to the inhabitants of the suburbs and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years old, the rehabilitation of the position of guardian of imme...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene.”For the 2014 municipal elections, this may be fair, he admits.
It's a problem of time and money.
The Party of the suburbs should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he already has seven list heads in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I've received since yesterday don't all emanate from the suburbs," he said.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage "had gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry indicated a softening of the U.S.’s defensive attitude toward its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions, the spying “had gone too far inappropriately.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that, like Barack Obama, he had ruled on “automatic pilot” when a series of incendiary revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities came to light.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr. Kerry said: “It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have become aware of certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War to the very cold years of the war.”
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had exceeded the limits, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and clarify clearly to the people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse as part of this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to jump.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We did well to prevent planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. spying case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to fight terrorism with the U.S., the U.S. Senate Sub-Committee President said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had posed regarding a possible withdrawal from anti-terrorist organizations due to the feeling of frustration caused by the National Security Agency’s surveillance.
“It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in our mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism,” Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and president of the U.S. Senate European Affairs Subcommittee, said in an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has picked up millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some U.S. allies, however the agency’s director said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies and NATO allies were collecting.
Further disclosures have been made of documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone and those of 34 other heads of state.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified the spying of the allies by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of turmoil, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip to Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators should be revealed in the coming days.
He said the route had yet to be defined.
Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, but also to show “affective firmness.”
He explained that European heads of state should be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programs they have been implementing themselves for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world to spy on,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Kerry has planned to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the ranking generated by U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, plunged by Shell’s poor results and following an announcement by the Fed of the holding in the state of its support for the economy, as expected.
An Australian woman has been sentenced to death in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of false statements after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she admitted to inventing the history of every room.
She was detained in a local police cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women's prison.
He is the daughter of former Australian rugby league player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Foreign Ministry to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“Obviously, we’ve had a scary time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after the payment of a deposit of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to a heavier sentence of up to two years in prison and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent killing in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to reshape its deteriorating image among tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
French police arrest Anderlecht supporters who came other than with RSCA cars
The French police decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club d'Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, said Marie Verbeke, the spokesman for the Brussels-midnight police area, on Friday.
The Belgian supporters of the RSCA who want to go to this Champions League meeting will have to use the displacement system set up by the RSCA.
“The bus convoy will be escorted by police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stadium,” the spokesman said.
The course will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intended to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has announced that measures have been taken to allow arrests and even guards to be carried out," Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the school board Marguerite-Bourgeoys
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated, a year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and members of the education staff, to reflect on ways to better integrate students who live on horseback between several cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
The vision diversity organization has been taking a year’s walk in schools to help students of all backgrounds discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, of artists, whether they are of a variety or have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
“So we create projects so that they identify with all of this,” says Aida Kamar, president of Vision Diversity.
Michel Venne, from the New World Institute, identified several challenges for the school board.
“On the transmission, for example, of what is Quebec culture, the feeling of belonging, the support of staff in the transformations we see, within the student clientele,” he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has set up a research centre that will provide tools for teachers who, too, sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, of the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
The preparation to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
“Different pedagogical strategies, that’s the real need,” she summarizes.
The research will focus on inclusion in all its aspects: linguistic, educational, social and cultural.
