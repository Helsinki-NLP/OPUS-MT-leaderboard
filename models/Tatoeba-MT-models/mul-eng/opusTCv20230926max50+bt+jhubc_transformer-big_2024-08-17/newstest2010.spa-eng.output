Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will receive them, among other things, for their exceptional effort in strengthening world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, visit the Nobel Institute, where for the first time you will meet with the five members of the committee who, in October, elected you from 172 people and 33 organizations.
Later, the presidential couple plans a meeting with Norway's King Harald V and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, although the third to receive it in office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased even further with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which he did not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to give them charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided which organization in particular.
During his entire program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet to which they will attend, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he didn’t deserve it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not just for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents "a challenge to take action".
Defendant of nature accused of blackmail
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police accused the president of the civic association of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Society of Nature Defenders (Sociedad de defensores de la naturese Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice).
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals he demanded investors money for their own benefit, Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police spokesman Alena Romov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The president of the Society of Nature Defenders Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently detained and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
In Brno you don't like the containers too much to separate the garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate the beverage packaging and in the villages of southern Moravia can be found containers to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
There they need several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don’t want to say that in Brno the garbage is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally retarded in the separation of waste, not only by the fact that we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all by the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a PET bottle in the center of the appropriate container?
It is almost impossible, above all it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> square, opposite the Potrefen<0xC3><0xA1> Huse.
Don't get angry with me, Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
Needless to say, it is not easy to separate the garbage elsewhere either.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
By Vacancies
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw several bottles of glass and plastic into the trash.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the garbage was already pouring out of the container.
It’s still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to be of much interest to the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extraliga, which shames us all over the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other subjects for Brno to be cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM company, Brno is indeed the worst in the whole Jihomoravsk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj region.
"Paroubek's Budget Takes Money From Sickness Income and Subsidies"
After the left, despite the government’s opinion, adds funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for rents, disease subsidies or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of the state debt or international litigation.
This will harm everyone who governs in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on some groups, they trusted that the government would subsequently ask for a loan for sensitive expenses, rents or sickness subsidies. “That only means delaying the problems for the future, it’s putting mines,” says Janota.
What happens is that when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest rates and, one day, you have to return the money.
The state does not have many options to make money.
If it does not reduce social subsidies or state operating expenses, it has to increase taxes.
To all those who added the left now: the firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And, later, their children too.
People don't have to worry about sick income or subsidies, they'll get it.
But the price to be paid will be the increase in public debt; next year will not be lacking in the treasure only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to increase along with interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer be able to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity subsidies, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the dislocations of the money in favor of some groups of voters, next year will also require five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The most you can do is keep them, which is also not free.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also in danger, warns Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will obtain money from the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ dividends, which are mostly owned by the state, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe and it is not a bottomless bag.
Last year, <0xC4><0x8C>EZ allocated $18 billion to the budget.
Every year dividends are cleared of ecological damage, used to complete the account for rents or served as a reserve for the prepared rent reform.
In addition, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn't end here.
Almost three billion were obtained from the budget to grant various compensations to the victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation expenses, even in construction savings.
It is not clear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
After that, the Minister will have to save money within the resort or, in the worst case, hand over the government's budget reserve.
There are also hundreds of millions missing for the State Pokadna (State Fund), the price of which is two billion and which has already been initiated. It must allow online monitoring of what the different authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister doesn’t find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The revealed plans sound promising.
With just one key, you can switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualizer software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at once.
They can switch between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, VMware's Srinivas Krishnamurti said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and was demonstrated for the first time several days ago.
It will launch in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware cooperates with European and American operators to conduct smartphone virtualization testing and these phones will reach customers during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only do skiers in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e worry about the snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow makes people not booking ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at offers, check prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether these Christmas will be snow or mud," said the maintainer of the news portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend a New Year's Eve in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n should not hesitate to book their stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, can try to wait a few more days.
The hotels in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n offer mainly weekly stays for Christmas.
I think they will continue to offer them, but they will soon give up and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a travel agency from Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD>, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what we are most interested in is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats offered are free.
That’s why we’ve prepared some last-minute Christmas stays,” said Intours director Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD>’s travel agency can still offer Christmas Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fourteen days of February are also sold very well, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year's interest in winter stays is affected by the lack of snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks remain snowed during the week, Christmas dates will run out as well,” says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou; last year it was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For Christmas and New Year’s Eve, we have the last free squares.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of Nochevieja's stays are already occupied at the Omnia hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B>.
In contrast, at Janské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B>’s latest Christmas hotel half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we found ourselves about sixty percent of the occupancy capacity.
February has been a bit weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
However, at the moment it seems that the hoteliers of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will pass the wishes of the snow waiting.
On Thursday, temperatures should drop and, if there is precipitation, in the mountains should snow.
But then temperatures will rise again, said Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> of Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
U.S.: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan issue his predecessor’s strategy, which he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his Afghan approach, eagerly awaited, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only is the phrase "equal to Iraq" used several times in the same text, but he also failed to use the title of Bush's January 2007 statement for his own statement: "A new path forward".
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush’s idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized him as “an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today nothing is talked about Iraq in the news.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, however objectively left his successor with a much more favorable initial situation than he could have expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will be repeated.
Field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal. He, even despite traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided gunmen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president vacated for three months, but nothing better happened to him, so at least he deceived the general about 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself had previously counted at least 10,000.
The most problematic part of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to finish this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase bears the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq’s society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is reached.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin, after which patriarchal tribal relations will remain.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to confusing relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum objective of the entire operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy is shocking for his volunteerism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war so that they "come home soon" will do some miracle here.
From the political point of view, setting the date of the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect declaration of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are increasingly less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians don’t know, and they don’t want to explain to their constituents, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to get worse and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to look for the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive for Barack Obama is the fact that three years are missing for the presidential election and that’s why there’s still plenty of time to find another strategy, if that’s a total failure.
Goldman Sachs Bank Managers Will Not Receive Cash Bonuses Again
The top executives of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn if they have taken excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to combine the bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I suppose Wall Street is fully aware of the longest path it must take, said former JPMorgan bank investor Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
The Goldman Sachs bank has faced criticism after pulling out nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK 300 billion) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the advent of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to levy at one time, with a 50 percent tax, bonuses for bankers exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (approximately CZK 712,000).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories less Physics
Five women, which is a record number, received this year’s Nobel Prizes in specialist categories and literature from King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden in Stockholm today.
In addition to the four scientists, the winners included a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as her compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The latest award, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by American Elinor Ostrom and his compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each winner collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million Czech crowns).
In case there are several prizes in each category, the prize is awarded to each other.
The traditionally most anticipated Nobel Prize, the Peace Prize, was awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, to U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country participating in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are essential to achieving peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus will receive on Friday morning the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota, who is proposing his stay in the government, as he disagrees with the version of the state budget for next year, approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps also Janota’s stay in the cabinet, will be the topics of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
On the appointment, the spokesman for President Radim Ochvat reported.
On his tenure in office, Janota wants to negotiate Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved on Wednesday the left’s proposals for fund transfers and raised money for salaries of officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government disagrees with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government on the other, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious internal political conflict. Due to this conflict, the future activities of Fischer's bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in the spring by the SDG, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party, begin to be controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of austerity measures, imposed in autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he declared during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians had long been neglecting "the serious problem", i.e., "the unsustainable deficit" of the public finances.
He said they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can rely on a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
ODS leader Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek mentioned that the budget is terrible and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the bureaucratic cabinet concept with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words “strong sentences.”
The head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek, reacted to Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek saying that the budget deficit is terrible, prepared for this year by the former government of Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek. It will exceed the 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD said that the approval of the state budget for next year was successful.
The people were also happy.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, starring Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say the leading roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sport, race relations, and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the apartheid racist regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography by an Oscar-winning American actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret it, I'll have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood’s drama about the boxing world of Million Dollar Baby, played the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up being a slave, of the fictitious president of the United States, but still lived, and even lived in God at Evan Toderpo.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation is still racially and economically divided.
He believes he is able to unite his people through sport, and that’s why he decides to unite rugby players, who belong to outsiders on a global scale.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to get Mandela’s story to the cinemas.
He had no other goal but to play this role in such a way that it was as similar as reality as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was talking like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were out of the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela’s hand.
I found that by holding his hand, I received his energy, it was transmitted and he had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
For me it is important to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was, when he finally met Pienaar at his house for the first time.
I remember calling the door, he opened and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, "In the movie I look much taller."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their actual models, and under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and also talked about ambitions for the Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety magazine Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of splendor over Norway resolved: the Russians made tests of a missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed on Norway.
Russia’s Defense Ministry has finally acknowledged that near the border with Norway it has tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The missile, the "Bulava" type, previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even his repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulav<0xC3><0xA1>, in most cases, did not fly out or a crash occurred in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, no problems occurred at first.
At the end of the flight, there were again technical problems in the aircraft.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was floating submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a vessel that is moving and being submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulava".
The Norwegians did not hesitate from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by stating that one cannot speak simply of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile sustained and the crash occurred in the third.
In the previous cases, the engines broke down immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely error-free, according to the Ministry of Defence's management, only six of the thirteen failed.
The success of almost fifty percent is full of optimism to the generals and that is why they continue to say that "Bulava" will one day fly smoothly and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, the total weight of which is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA in Moscow at the age of 51.
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will return to a professional hockey game at the age of 51.
Former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team and possibly play Friday in KHL's duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash is injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and has committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov said.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice rink, he will become the longest-serving professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played for Hartford in the NHL at the age of fifty-one during the entire season and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the group of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, won the Canadian Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second half of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hall of Fame of Hockey.
Hyundai has met the requirements of the unions. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent supplementary work, the unions on Monday declared the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions one more shift on Saturday.
We cannot give up our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed additional voluntary work for Saturday 19 December, that is, it will work in two shifts, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
According to the server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working the shift on Saturday.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Va<0xC5><0x88>ka, the company decided to change the way it motivates its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for extra hours or they can take a day off on December 28, i.e. extend Christmas holidays in one day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts will receive money for travel and food.
Because supplemental work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon immediately decided to cancel all supplemental work for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
The employees of the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted virtually every day until last week.
After signing the agreement the unions will cancel the emergency strike.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the unionists should be held on Monday morning.
Union chief Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that if they pledged to meet the requirements and signed the document, they are willing to cancel the emergency by strike.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously came on strike for frequent additional jobs.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and the alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work extra hours to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
The unionists in their statement on Monday's strike emergency also demanded that none of the employees, who stopped manufacturing last Wednesday, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, unions demand that the company minimize it.
In addition, this year they require a salary of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Serial production was started last November.
As of last September, it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the 'enhanced' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some drugs are already available.
AIDS cannot be cured until now.
However, patients’ lives can be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called metallocarbons have an effect on albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metallocarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a way other than all the drugs used today, and therefore can solve the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus’s albumin.
The metallocarbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedron cages composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitorous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, there is no fractionation of the HIV virus and no mature and infectious corpuscles of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which is still being systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was carried out in sample, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarbons on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however, they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes, that metallocarborans are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0x98>ez<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, head of the laboratory of the Biochemical and Structural Biology at the Institute of Chemistry.
He fights for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said the budget approved for next year is "spanky" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, according to him, think about its future existence.
The statements of the SDGs were pointed out by the Prime Minister as strong sentences.
They say there is time left for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said the bureaucratic cabinet concept with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the prime minister has to decide whether he wants to support the minority in the Chamber of Deputies, who tries to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of the SDGs and social democracy towards the problem of the public deficit is completely different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned.
The Chamber of Deputies approved the budget for 2010, however with the amendments by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of Deputies increased the money for salaries of state officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the SDG proposals, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should rule with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The SDGs before the vote left the room and so fulfilled the government’s desire, that the modified budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disillusionment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disillusionment and a sense of worthlessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will re-evaluate the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of the adoption of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> televize Janota asked for a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He pointed out, that he is thinking about staying in the function.
The reason is his disillusionment with the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as in the government have nothing to do with the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD nominees, who imposed changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly, if he resigns, if the House approves other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to sickness subsidies, rents, or the amendment of the service law.
Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek: Ministers nominated by the SDGs are not to blame
It is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
Ministers nominated by the SDGs have done nothing wrong, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek stressed in the U.S. text news.
He recalled, that in several ministries in the posts of lieutenants there are people belonging to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit of the public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct, which rests on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, you will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of SDG members.
I haven’t thought about that, when it’s time, I’ll deal with it,” Defense Minister Martin Bart<0xC3><0xA1>k told reporters in the House of Deputies, who was appointed to the government precisely by the members of the SDG.
Prime Minister Fischer in the afternoon went to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
The SDG has given in at the request of the Prime Minister.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that the SDGs on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would probably vote against the amended budget, if the Prime Minister does not explicitly ask SDGs deputies to allow the budget to be accepted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, he responded to the question, if the SDG is not concerned about the absence of the party leader in parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned from office, he knew that in the following months it was mainly about the bolshevization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek himself reacted.
According to the new schedule of trains from <0xC4><0x8C>D will circulate fewer trains for almost the same rates
<0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy (Czech Railways) from 13 December will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains and, on the contrary, reinforce some links.
The total length of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule comes into effect.
Most rates, including the basic and customer price, will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will gain for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostravsko, dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy for this line will add a pendolin highway.
The direct train, on the other hand, will not circulate to Bratislava again.
On the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line, there will be fewer trains, while the direct links to Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the biggest reduction in dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy planned transport is in the Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area.
There will also be cancellation of two night trains on the route Prague - T<0xC3><0xA1>bor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice and some fast trains on the line Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice will be reduced only to a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem.
This is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distance links to the capital will end at Prague Hlavn<0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will circulate every two hours.
As of 13 December, travelers will not travel to Bratislava again in Pendolino.
This year’s regional railways account: 200 million more than before
Fast trains are charged and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy will receive next year four billion crowns in total, just like this year. Local trains are charged by the regions, next year they will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the state will help them almost three thousand.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
For fast and local dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy trains have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one-year.
Dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy are happy with the system, and maybe that’s why they didn’t raise the prices of a large majority of the tickets.
Changes will occur only on one-day tickets - <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and on cheap eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka internet tickets.
For travellers without a customer card, the <0xC4><0x8C>D Net price will increase from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will depend on the distance, so far there was the unique price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippine armed forces continue to detain more than 50 people, children were released
Armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several primary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only about 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children arrested and one teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping occurred in the southern province of Agusan.
They say approximately 19 armed men use the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police had previously persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence, which was caused by the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In southern Philippines in the province of Maguindanao it was due to the recent killing, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 killing, related to the governor’s election, were 30 journalists.
Suspected of involvement in the massacre, they arrested the governor of this province in the south of the Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential dynasty of the Ampatuans.
Muslim separatists also operate on the island of Mindanao.
However, on Tuesday, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The story of RSA refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>) will be released in American cinemas, capturing part of the biography of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom he chose years ago for the starring role Mandela himself.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born of the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk's, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
great hopes, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa they culminate preparations for the world championship in football. At the same time the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film on RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the starring roles by the “uninteresting” Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman says, however, that he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, to - as they say - charge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good, if through the film we can remember Mandela’s character and message.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the national rugby team suit
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. Portrait of the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of people, racially and for long separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also puts on the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the field of play. RSA then won the World Cup.
By entering the grass in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela won great ovations fourteen years ago, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may be able to help people join and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans however are skeptical, as said in a recent interview for LN a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
Lounsko burns a transformer worth tens of millions of crowns
The fire in the morning caught a transformer from the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps in a switch box near the village of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsko.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, the spokesman for firefighters in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously, firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by the fire, but later changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishing matter.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the transformer short circuit.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tov<0xC3><0xA1>, the company’s spokeswoman, the failure does not endanger the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tov<0xC3><0xA1> it will be necessary to replace the transformer destroyed by a new one.
During the ten years of <0xC4><0x8C>eps’ activity nothing similar happened, such averments are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerov<0xC3><0xA1> Hendrychov<0xC3><0xA1>, the spokeswoman for the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ company for the northern Czech Republic, power supplies were not cut, and the fire of the power station does not affect the operation of homes, offices or businesses.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps worked in the territory of the Czech Republic as an exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, electric driving of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It keeps in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system, and also maintains the electrical drive 4339 kilometers long.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura to file a complaint by slander to three hetmans of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Student Agency owner Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will today file a calumny complaint to three social democratic hetmans.
It is Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek of the South Moravian Region, Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nek de Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> kraj and the Hetman of Olomouc region Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura mentioned it in Twenty Minutes on Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l.
The demand has to do with the company’s effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy.
All three Hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the cake", yet we brought only the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy, which is not true. We know the prices of <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy, which were fixed last week.
So we have nothing left to defend ourselves.
It is because of the slander towards the Student Agency society, he told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
He mentioned at the same time having the tests from all regions, and he said that they have not taken the necessary measures in line with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers this complaint because of the continuation of Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to the other Hetmans to do so too.
I suppose, which will also be clearly demonstrated this time, that Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses false and false arguments, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek mentioned.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that it would invest several million crowns in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures from the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura started the campaign after the regions agreed with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dr<0xC3><0xA1>hy to maintain regional railway links and for the order of approximately 150 billion crowns did not call a tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, similar steps are at odds with the law and with the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura claims to have been threatened by a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't leave it, we could lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know, which gentleman he is talking about, I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l today.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will end the usual habits.
As a first vaccine it should be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that the mandatory vaccine would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine are over.
The Institute of Medicine is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts also have it clear in the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
From January onwards, children born on August 2 of last year will be able to receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a single dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier, have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of age.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily let their children vaccinate against pneumococcals.
Parents however paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450,000 crowns per year on vaccines.
No clutch will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 a year on all vaccinations of children.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal is the cause of middle otitis, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Of the pneumococcal infections in our country every year, 28 children under the age of 10 die according to research in hospitals.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the pneumococcal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Is the vaccine mandatory?
However, opinions appear at the same time, that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
From January it must be covered by the insurance and voluntary companies.
The mandatory vaccine would be better, said Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the head of the civic association Nahlas.
Their association has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path that we now have to take, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> mentioned.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcals.
At this moment we do not think at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
The voluntary vaccine has its drawbacks, doctors say
The president of the society of pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>, recognized that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
"In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Experts expect that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents will allow their babies to be vaccinated against pneumococcal.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change too because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs were afraid, however, that insurance companies could “take the money out of health insurance.”
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait, until they are paid by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in the 40,000 vaccines per month, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The son of an American artist involved in "the theft of a museum"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings valued at US$20 million (<0xC2><0xA3>12 million) from his father’s museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while carrying 90 frames in his vehicle and trailer.
Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta's father, 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
The AP reported that an unidentified police official claimed that a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta's 52-year-old son told police that his father had ordered him to "enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a warehouse."
The agency said Frazetta's father refused to grant such permission.
The Labour Party defends tax increases in the budget
Ministers have advocated tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, in the face of criticism from the opposition, businesses and unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling "lost" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the elections.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security spending and a 1% stoppage in public sector wage agreements as of 2011.
Anger for Social Security
The unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned of future “problems.”
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow by around <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year, has angered the business community, which says this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF ANTERNAL INFORMATION TO THE PRESUMPTION
Social security with an additional 0.5% increase, as of April 2011
Economy will shrink more than expected by 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on banker bonds
The 1 point rise in corporate tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax deductions for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Ministry of Finance, a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 a year will earn <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit for 2013 entailed “difficult decisions,” but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on 5% of higher wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that tax increases and delineated spending cuts were a “sandbox in the desert” compared to what was needed.
"These are big figures, which will allow us to halve the deficit, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he had confidence that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party's forecasts of future economic growth, which will influence the amount borrowed and the rate at which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he stated that the economy would likely shrink by 4.75% this year, far worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while the loan application would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion above the previously estimated.
"A wasted opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new ad campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour party’s “debt crisis,” said the <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion loan application projection for the next six years was unsustainable.
The ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, eclipsing “clinically” the difficult options until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They haven't included anything significant about what they're going to do," Minister of Finance shadow Philip Hammond said. "They had the opportunity to do it and they've wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the elections, win who wins."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists on protecting schools, hospitals and the police from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek greater short-term deficit reduction.
But Democratic liberals claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to support next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like “sand castles.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing of the announcements, such as the rise in inflation of some disability subsidies next April, mentioned above, would leave the finance minister exposed to accusations of election maneuvering, as the money could simply recover the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that it is providing the people most in need and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not publish post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that adjusting public spending would only make itself felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said that the Minister of Finance’s figures involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“This is really delaying the pain for later,” said its director, Robert Chote.
“All important announcements will come after the election, win who wins,” added Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s economic advisor to accountants.
"This has been the false report before the budget. Markets realize this."
FBI Investigates ‘American Arrests in Pakistan’
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern province of Punjab.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said it was also looking for information on the men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
“If they’re American citizens, of course we’re going to be very interested in the charges they’ve been arrested for and what kind of circumstances they’re being held in,” said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in touch with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
He said the house was already in the sight of the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the detainees.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency reported, but said the U.S. had to "work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and recruit people."
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian “abuses”
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details the regime’s “models of abuse” before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights history.
Officials have said that such criticism has a political basis.
The thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the election held by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
The BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Jamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International cited the story of Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, who claimed he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election result.
“They often hit me in the face,” he said.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said that after five days he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, said some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuse.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed to have been held in a container along with 75 others for more than eight weeks, at a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the discomfort of post-election and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of the bodies were confused and the parliamentary committee’s findings had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
There was a ski run in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol site of interest into a race track.
The track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump ramp, opposite a 100-meter-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but that it was pretty scary.
You can see below a beautiful view of the city lights flickering.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent.”
The awards were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be allowed to melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have asked for a ban on minaret construction and a widespread warning about the supposed Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the most openly secular societies.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and concerned the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
It’s been months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr. Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener who reproduces discussions between teachers and students about the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use a interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
These are seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life, which concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, professors and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They are not able to spread this argument completely.
Conservatives only doubt the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists whom Mr Bowen interviewed tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions to what extent French political strategists (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims probably have a more unjust treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historical commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, he perceives “a value adjustment.”
After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The World's Most Desolating Landscape
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fishing have focused on recently opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Aware of the complicated history and policy of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave evidence of value by confronting the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson as a brave 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The children, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century, it exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one millionth of the area of a wild adult’s range. The climate is almost never suitable: a polar bear resident in Singapore has been greened by algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis turns to stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and eskimo Indians use high-powered assault rifles to bring down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and a stunning look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It’s not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It is not for lack of effort.
The pioneering travels of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave clues for the first time about the displacement of the ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines drew a map of the moving ice cords that circulate under the masses of ice.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful addition, but tough individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the affluent system within the Arctic ice, formed by bursts of saline water that is compressed while frozen.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once the summer ice retreats, which is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among 6,000 who place crowns in Arlington graves
De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to put a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood on their boots.
In a few months, from where they are boarding us, these could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it’s us, I’d like someone to do the same for me, so I’m just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to place crowns in the tombs of veterans in various sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and other people decided to decorate several hundred tombs at Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip each year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves in Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and at the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said he made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a late military career.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of rewarding those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It’s like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked through the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers went to older tombs of World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they don’t receive as many visits as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples took their hand as they carried the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red tie tied at the top.
Close by, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the gloomy atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the glacial air.
Some read aloud carved names on the stones, while others inclined to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who would shed tears from her eyes in front of her son’s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of the Sgto Marine Gunner David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. ..my son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone to remember it."
Cuban officials arrested a U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything considered “dangerous.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has repeatedly applied for permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of an American contractor may likely trigger tensions between the Castro brothers’ communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a “slow-paced” approach to improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to announce the news of the arrest Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign hotel visitors, and in some government establishments, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are in jail for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said he could not provide further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly distasteful.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing mobiles for free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the organization Human Rights Watch, who recently published a hard report on the freedoms in Cuba, called “Nuevo Castro, itself Cuba”, a reference to its location in Castro.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and jailed in one day.
He stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials plot to send men to Afghanistan <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Pakistani authorities on Saturday neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case can help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who travel the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
Investigators said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the Internet video site YouTube.
Saifullah directed the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason, they were rejected, said the official, who spoke from anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men did not mutate and were even trying to get proper approval to access the al Qaeda camps when Pakistani police arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determines who they are.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has prioritized trying to infiltrate people inside al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting go of those who do not show a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda is paying particular attention to aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, because of their potential to have access to U.S. targets and because of their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they admit, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than following the recruitment model how many have already followed?
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand climate ‘action’
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here on the streets demanding that negotiators working at the city’s Bella Center Convention Center, bolder actions for the climate.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the number to be closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, though a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English saying “There is no planet B” and one in Spanish declaring, “The Earth says enough.”
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said travel to Peru, her mother’s home country, made me aware of the distressing issues the country must deal with because of the impacts of climate change that are already happening.”
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement, he said.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to evade it for longer.
Police prevented the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
In accordance with Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in climate talks, activists wearing sports masks and black suits placed several explosives near Copenhagen’s main channel, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they began as calls, but that they were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “I really wasn’t aware of the situation.”
He then went on to say in Mandarin, "As the meeting place is great, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of each to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and from different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect the negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Data from a test reveals persistent racial differences
Last week’s federal rankings booklet on performance in mathematics, was very good news for the public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country’s best performing systems, the qualification booklet showed that fourth and eighth graders have given up at a faster pace over the past two years, with respect to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of fourth grade white D.C. students over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance difference grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans of the eighth grade remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant point, from 245 to 244.
The average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference that separated fourth-grade white and black students in 2003, when the first ENPE was announced in the District, was 60 points from the scale (262 to 202).
Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely decreased to 58.
Some district education lawyers expressed concern last week, as the advances made by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the set by meeting those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit organization that advocates for educational equity in the District.
I’m not jumping for joy by a two or three-point difference,” said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Elemental Eaton.
Brown, an avid critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message from the test scores is that the city’s high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what’s worrying is that we’re not devoting the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performing students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at high school and middle school students who did not master the basics of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum of mathematics from kindergarten to sixth grade, emphasizes real-life games and experiences, which was introduced into the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase overall system performance and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which will be needed to decrease the difference.
Here’s a kind of escalating dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies scores from urban testing.
The solution of conventional policy is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important timeline.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to cling to the white and black middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to ending the performance difference is to extend the 180-day traditional public school year in the District to compete with autonomous schools.
We have to get to nearly 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers’ union last year in a year of 185 days, which he considers as an “indicator” to seek a bigger increase in the upcoming agreement.
Making Higher Education a Part of More Futures
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resolution.
Graciela Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, 12, descended and blinked for a moment in front of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald meadows.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Still, when she and the group’s other eighth grade students explored Gettysburg, where the tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! This is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Caray, seriously? he said thoughtfully, when the guide talked about the low proportion of school teacher-students.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children had visited on their three-day trip, and had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question isn’t whether you’re going to college.
The question is to whom.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access college education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second-generation” Hispanics graduate from college, a notable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, especially Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country’s workforce.
Those who analyze those with the highest performance say they often have a natural affinity for the school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with U.S. schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if the efforts are sustained over time.
Observing low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it is deduced that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these kids, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the tour through the universities of Graciela is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems, to run college preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry Reaches Agreements With 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are poised to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq’s oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
The U.S. companies moved away having climbed into only two of the 10 subsoiled sites.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who made an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for basements in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants at the opening of Iraq’s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military withdraws, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from risking more vigorously in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest reserve of crude, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage, because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have tightened ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and provided technical advice in recent years, have walked away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The National Petroleum Corporation, owned by the Chinese state, offered more contracts than any other company and made large investments in contracts for two main sites.
“We know that China is on track to become a major economic and technological power,” said the ministry’s spokesman, Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be at the side of its competitors and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
The companies preselected to submit proposals made offers that were then confronted with the grant per barrel that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels at each site.
Al Qaeda's main planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
A suspected U.S. missile attack on Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men thought to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles struck his car near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, the type operated by the CIA within Pakistan’s illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car towards the Afghan border when the car received the impact, a Pakistani civil intelligence agency official said, speaking by phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as a high-ranking military planner for al Qaeda, which directed the terrorist group’s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He dedicated himself to conspiring around the world, said a senior official, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guide to al Qaeda’s top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somalia had risen rapidly in the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a well-known name for some Americans, but that does not diminish in any way the threat posed to us and our allies.
If confirmed, Somalia would be the second al Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led drone strikes has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a tally in The Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be due to an improved tactic by terrorist groups, who have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
The UN's top envoy to Kabul on the verge of resigning
The top U.N. envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would step down in March, ending a tumultuous mandate that was hurt by widespread corruption charges in the U.N.-backed Afghan presidential election.
Eide’s departure comes when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal starting in 18 months prompts other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants, who cooperate with Afghanistan’s political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary
U.N. General Ban Ki-moon, so he would have time to find a replacement.
What I have said is that it is better for them to start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I got here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said Galbraith's accusations, who was fired, "certainly damaged the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate U.S.-led assistance efforts in Afghanistan.
He also boosted UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries, who lend themselves to the Afghan mission, saying this would increase his confidence that his money is being used properly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, holding that the cumbersome UN hiring regulations undermined his ability to capture talent.
So the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose “significant additional sanctions” against Iran for its failure to enter into talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, remained important to the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs me is that if we’ve learned anything from Iraq over the last six years, it’s the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population in general.
He argued that it would take "a package of incentives and disincentives", "to persuade the Iranian government that they would be really less safe with nuclear weapons", because "their people will suffer enormously" the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face “credible” consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the UN Security Council’s and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, he said he would renegotiate the restriction on his nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial part of his enriched uranium reserve in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two parties and earn time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to have moved away from tentative agreements, in part, experts say, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of committing to the United States.
Frankly, I think Iran’s tightening with the international community on some proposals that they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they haven’t been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline on Dec. 31 for Iran to respond to the proposals, before other options are reconsidered, including continuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “devastating sanctions.”
In a statement made in New York, Iran’s mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday’s “unfounded and baseless accusations” by some members of the Security Council on Iran’s nuclear activities, and said it has the will to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, “so far as to achieve a long-term goal.”
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and participation.
Gates urged both sides to decrease the potential for conflict, to avoid any delays in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety over the pending reduction, U.S. officials quoted Gates’ words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: “We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them.”
In an aging China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters preaching to them about the fact that “Mother Earth is too tired to support more children” and “a baby more means one more grave.”
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and started encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: In no way.
We have already given all our time and energy just for one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after a single-child policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously restless, single malnourished children, affectionately dubbed “little emperors,” a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six from when the policy became effective, according to the Division
Demographics of the UN, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to exploit from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly-cultivated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of Shanghai’s Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, said fertile couples should have babies to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and alleviate future labor shortages.”
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
A gradual relief.
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate politics face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labor discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoid critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in policy enforcement.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortion.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on single-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases in which both husband and wife are unique children, and in 2007 they attenuated many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Institute of Demographic Research, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost at night, posters ordering families to have one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointment response
Although officials from a rural city outside Shanghai say they have observed a moderate increase in requests from couples who want a second child after the campaign launch, the more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally eligible to do so.
But like many Chinese, they have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly see single-child politics as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
Yes, we are being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said he wants a single child because she too was: “We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained it more bluntly.
For parents with two middle-class careers who reduce the birth rate, he said, it’s about having enough success to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up watching their parents’ struggle during the early days of China’s experiment with capitalism and don’t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child takes a lot of time from parents, he said.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, “they have to remodel their apartment,” and the strategy “has to have a curriculum prepared for the best daycares when the child is 9 months old.”
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by challenging attitudes and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations taking on the bulk of their shoulders.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Developed by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give to the poor to face global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature rise that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives him a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as "the big picture."
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce their emissions over the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also boosted talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same kind of verbal artificial fires that have dominated the talks last week were presented.
U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is adopting a harder line with China, compared to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to make a deal without major developing countries advancing and taking action, Stern said, who also lamented that the text did not do enough to ensure that cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked “common sense,” or was “very irresponsible” for saying earlier in the week that the U.S. would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, the fault lines have erupted both within the developing world, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries of the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the boldest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it is not surprising that major powers are discussing who should be spending on limiting greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to contain the big emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change adviser for Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change said they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say the talks will produce at most a political deal.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States drew up a 24-page preliminary draft treaty early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said pushing small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the exceptional issues before the heads of government come to close a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and ran into the corridors of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delimit the claims that will be arbitrated over the next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people enter and leave the convention center, the activists playing the guitar present night shows mocking the countries that they say are being sold, and preliminary hand-in-hand proposals are being made instead of by mail), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here at this time, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, vice president for the global policy of International Conservation.
The heavy weights are coming.
Britain’s first train at 225 km/h redefines Monday’s sentiment
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 kmh, when it passes like a beam from Ashford, Kent, to London’s St Panrcas station, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transportation, will then join Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and the change of airplanes and rail cars would reduce national carbon emissions, as well as ease congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears over environmental damage, can still curb Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on Dec. 30, according to the Times.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn within a radius of 25 meters of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a wider high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
“It looks like this will be the most beneficial option,” one member of the railroad said.
Once completed, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be inaugurated before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 kmph, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is being designed to support 400 mt long trains, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the capital’s space restrictions, an existing station is expected to be expanded to suit the high-speed network.
Experts in the railway industry argue that only St Pancras International or Euston station offers that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes the scheme should proceed, but broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if you run the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first trains would be forced to leave the fast lanes for existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered as the crucial point necessary to ensure a change of aircraft to trains, a reference point for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers face mortgage for a conservative’s <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 orange
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party spokesman, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived "in rations", increased his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build a brick-framed extension at his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of the members' expenses. Last night Mr. Duncan said the applications "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
Nearby homes have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as a "naranjal".
The neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent inquiry by the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges on its previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 mortgage from his London property to the home of his electoral district, which he had purchased in 1991, the year before he became a deputy.
The documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 per month in mortgage interest, until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan’s Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase was going to finance the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The standard variable mortgage type of the BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, the type it is now.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 per month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as Speaker of the House opposition in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive "rational" after the spending scandal.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like shit."
He said: “I spend my money in my garden and ask for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don’t.”
The MP, a millionaire by his former profession as an oil trader, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the payroll office that this “could be considered excessive.”
An activist dug a hole in the shape of the symbol of the pound sterling in Mr. Duncan’s lawn as a protest, after it was revealed that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for primordial improvements, approved by both the payroll office and later by Legg."
He added: "It's not about avoiding and breaking or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could not in any way be clearer or simpler.”
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Brighton Beach Palapa Event
Brighton's palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months on an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palates for each day of December, using villains as their theme.
The event began on December 1, with guests who could see the last straw from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. every day, with pastels filled and ponche served for free.
The villains chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and La Primera Navidad, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid clergyman from the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
“We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society.”
“Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
“The idea of the Palapa Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to prove and represent that through spirituality.”
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters on Saturday protested against an ambitious and binding agreement to fight global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, marched through the frozen Danish capital in response to an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday, January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents broke out shortly after the demonstration began in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke into shops with canoes and hammers, a AFP journalist reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
Police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action coalition (CJA), one of the organisers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were detained “without distinctions,” stressing that a hundred of them “were immobilized on the street on Saturday night and seated in spite of the intense cold.”
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the headquarters of the negotiations.
Protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle-lit vigil, which was set up to welcome the guests.
Most protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as some Africans.
Around 3,000 people, most with celestial showers, responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen at the Friends of the Earth call to form “blue tides” for “justice and for the weather.”
Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying: there’s time, said Benin singer Angélique Kidjo.
In Africa, there are rivers that dry, water courses that you can walk through like never before could have been done.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to “unite climate justice and social justice”: “Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world.”
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands highly vulnerable to warming, gave the initial tipping to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red clothes and wore slogans in favor of solar power.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, there were concentrations of hundreds of protesters who claimed to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
This Saturday Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russo-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before closing.
The first provisional results would be announced from Saturday night to Sunday.
The five running candidates, including outgoing president Sergey Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of voting scrutiny.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili “complains that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation,” his spokesman Manana Manjgaladzé said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After his separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand dead, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that he is ready to join the international community.
“This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state,” Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP.
She was among the voters who went to the election table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large tables show Bagapch next to the Russian president and prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places of this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: “We, the people of Abkhazia, thank Moscow’s support, and very particularly, the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope that his country is quickly recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising his vodka glass.
For his part, the opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that gives Russia control of the abject railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support current power or opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is needed to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be held two weeks later.
Climate: demonstrations in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to claim an ambitious and binding agreement before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the middle of the cold Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement to come into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
The former South African archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle-lit vigil, which was set up to welcome the guests.
A few moments after the start of the demonstration, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke into shops with bricks and hammers, a AFP journalist reported.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, pulling several of them to the floor.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, saying they were mainly members of the “Black Blocks”, ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with a handkerchief, and four cars were set on fire near a busy house during the incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, police said.
We did not take our eyes off the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as the helicopters of the law enforcement forces flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as were some Africans.
Around 3,000 people, most with celestial showers, responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen at the Friends of the Earth call to form “blue tides” for “justice and for the weather.”
Today we take to the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, told AFP he came to Copenhagen to “unite climate justice and social justice”: “Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world.”
The Oxfam organization along with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands highly vulnerable to warming, gave the initial tipping to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, showed red dresses and handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar power in front of the City Hall of the Philippine capital.
In either Hong Kong or Jakarta, there were concentrations of hundreds of protesters claiming to act against climate change.
In France, demonstrations organized by the "350" network brought together hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
The subject of history and geography is reinforced by the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that it will be broadcast in the Sunday Informative (JDD) that history and geography would be "fortified" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of the bachelor's degree.
From now on, all undergraduate students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "enough with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The branches of General and Literary Education cannot be sub-frames of the C, he continues even underscoring: “I also did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged at having eliminated history and geography in second of bachelor’s degree in technological schools.”
An IFOP poll published Saturday in L’Humanité revealed that approximately seven French out of ten (69%) disapproved of the government’s project to eliminate compulsory teaching of history-geography in second of bachelor’s degree C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected representatives of this class as well.
Instead, the Minister added that "there is no talk" of eliminating philosophy from the second bachelor's program C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will give an admission test that will target their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will practice in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as teachers in practice.
If you do all the pre-competition practices, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, i.e. more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that took place on Saturday morning Jean Jouzel, vice president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (GIEC) invited by Ulm Street High School.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the conference call "Ernest", a day composed of a series of fifteen-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and convey a desire to know more, explained in the framework of the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish from the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants from among the experts in their discipline and selected them on their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, “we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes,” Jean Jouzel, who exhibited without notes but with the help of graphs in front of about 50 people, told AFP.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping that the public will understand that “the Copenhagen conference is founded on an extremely serious scientific record.”
The videos filmed during those lectures will be online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next “Ernest” day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bi-monthly pace.
Delay in payments: distaste among prison guards, is expected to take action
Prison guard unions called for a "general mobilization" on Friday to demand payment before the end of the year holidays, premiums and overtime, which was postponed until the end of the year for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers Force (2nd Guards Union) asked staff out of service to join the demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and “block” them to denounce the theft of their possessions.
The prison CGT (3rd trade union) calls on them to “meet in general assemblies in different prisons to achieve mass mobilization”, as it calls for “shameful and unacceptable” the failure to pay in December of the “extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and public holidays” work.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), “convokes the general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and anger.”
The Directorate of Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased a lot in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but say the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the Chancellery reported that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the watch unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I have no doubt about the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I requested the Directorate of the Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at ensuring that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of extra hours does not occur again in the future.
December’s pay will then be scarce, except for management staff who enjoy the benefits of the famous premiums for functions and objectives, and who “always blame the budget requirements,” the Ufap/Unsa deplores.
It’s a real scandal, the regional FO union in Marseille said outraged, announcing its decision to boycott to a new order “all meetings and calls.”
Staff will not come to work on the corresponding Sundays and public holidays if those in the month of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when tasks and missions are increasing without taking more effective, it is more than unfortunate to dare to attack the salaries of staff, estimates the CGT prison in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, not in all regions the same thing happens, as some are luckier than others.
But anyway, the result is not what was expected, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes “better gifts” than those he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to the famous television presenter, Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion about gifts: “I make better gifts than the ones I receive.”
During a special interview broadcast by ABC on Sunday night, President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the end of the year at their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family’s little four-legged companion, will be from the game.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will “of course” receive a gift, according to excerpts from the program broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: “In no way, last year I made you beautiful gifts,” she said, provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before answering with humor pointing to the First Lady’s pearl necklace: “Who gave you that?”
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who wholeheartedly supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also recalled their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama remembered a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
“I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball,” he said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the house, yet I loved that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL claims to be in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was intervened again in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his annexes, while RTL claims the singer was subjected to a coma induced to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was intervened again Wednesday night to Thursday at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked for "disc hernia surgery injuries" performed in Paris on November 26, his press service in that same city said, indicating that the injuries "were reparated."
However, the singer's press service tried to convey peace of mind by stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pains and complications".
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more sure about their condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that “according to some sources” no cannula would have been introduced to it after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic due to a disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days ago, was practiced by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well known in the art environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux declined to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection derived from the intervention carried out by Delajoux.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, Johnny Hallyday’s close friend, explained Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through “a bad time,” but said there was “no problem” because the rocker is “a fighter.”
"He called me just before I went to Los Angeles, and I told him it was a fool's errand to get twelve hours of flying after such an operation, it's not possible," Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, intended to reassure by stating that Johnny Hallyday, “satisfactoryly reacted to antibiotics” and that the infection was “controlled.”
Camus said he had talked to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall in his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on from a "colon cancer" after a mild infection.
In late September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem is overstated. Fans and journalists noticed the difficulty of the musician moving on stage.
By mid-November, his supporters had, even, to deny a new hospital.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title in his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 World Long Pool Championships, won an international title on Thursday at a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in the short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which polyurethane bathers were allowed for the last time, only three world records were surpassed when many more were actually expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, a mark he owns in a long swimming pool (20.94).
In one of the two distances queens of swimming, at 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman was imposed with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet advanced to Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as he had planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that will be banned from January 1st.
These swimmers, originating from 238 world records since February 2008, finish their epic in Istanbul, where they competed for the first time in 1999 for the same test.
This time the use of bathers did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark in 400 m free (3:32.77), however, was imposed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), against Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give up on this race.
I knew I wasn’t going to be able to beat a world record this time, but I was able to defend my title and fulfill my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: A sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola sold for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to the French writer Emile Zola was sold on Thursday for $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This 2-meter-long panel by 63 cm high, dates from the 3rd century AD, and its price had been estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "which represents four dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satyrs and drunken women, is an uncommon piece, as there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions in ancient Rome and Egypt, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot has been the most uplifted by buyers, no doubt, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
Only a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For almost 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of his bathhouse in his Parisian private mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council for a short time, before the husband.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the frescoes of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborts Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that the conditions were not given to move the deposed Honduran president, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the coup government denied the bailout.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation with President Zelaya in the evening, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of making the transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take to Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
In order to grant him a bailout, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and ask for political asylum abroad.
But the deposed president refused because he wanted to reach Mexico as the guest-executed head of state.
“The coup government suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign my office ... they wanted me to resign,” Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he has often made statements since the beginning of the five-month political crisis in the country of Central America.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added the deposed president, who has been a refugee in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy submitted a request for safe conduct to us, but unfortunately we could not accept it for not containing an asylum request, the Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Matute, told HRN radio on Wednesday.
I will not ask for asylum in any country,” said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with Telesur, based in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do it as president of the Honduran people.
Rumors about Zelaya’s departure on Wednesday mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the coup government’s position.
That reflects the marginal character of this government in the face of international norms, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela’s socialist president Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he surprisingly returned on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and must answer to justice for the crime of “high treason,” according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial poll, elected Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term ends on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Fuels Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday, U.S. trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic reactivation of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technology-compliant Nasdaq, 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We receive good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he explained, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half-full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused primarily on the US trade balance figures, “which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, in particular the exports of goods, which reflect the growth of the major economies they trade with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, jobless enrollments in the United States unexpectedly increased, with 474,000 applications filed.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “was the lowest in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market fell.
The 10-year Treasury bond yield rose to 3.482% versus 3.423% on Tuesday night, and the 30-year bond yield to 4.492% versus 4.408% on the evening.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power abuche the “Ladies of White”
This Thursday, hundreds of supporters of Cuban power ousted the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some 40 "Ladies of White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were attacked on the street by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of those detainees, a AFP journalist said.
The Yankees are dying!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to revolutionaries!", "Viva Fidel y Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l!" shook the dissidents' power activists with a fist.
The latter were escorted by agents dressed in civilian clothes who came to "protect" them.
On the eve, a similar demonstration was unleashed against the “White Ladies” in Havana, with no injuries or arrests.
But in the Habanero neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day, were detained by police officers dressed as civilians, a AFP journalist reported.
The agents forced the vehicles to the dissidents who were huddled by supporters of the government, according to the journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents under similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "White Ladies", awarded with the 2005 Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "apply for the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the dissent, declared one of its leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities call the opponents “mercenaries” or “agents” at the expense of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely done in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration of government militants against the “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of peddling rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
A stranger kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others in the centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Altos del Sena) city on Thursday at a high tide in the afternoon
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant was allegedly hit with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an elderly man, in the pharmacy or in front of it at No. 85 of Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s Boulevard, police sources and witnesses reported.
Following serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a police union official Alliance.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the elder died.
The life of the other injured, with the seemingly affected vital organs, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered fainting and was hospitalized "in a state of shock," a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by the boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
Apparently at random, he would have injured two more pedestrians: one thirty-year-old man, and another forty seriously.
At night, the scene of the crime was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher knives carrying cross-breds on his back, said Arnaud Pressé, head of the Alliance union in the Altos del Sena.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the alien, according to testimonies obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in his thirties with a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They couldn’t do it because the guy was strong, said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd threw themselves at him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
By the boulevard Jean-Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s, at the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, tried to arrest the gunman and were stabbed, according to police testimonies.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me that there was a wounded man on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old gentleman on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I felt a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35 years old, arrived with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Nanterre Prosecutor's Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Altos del Sena (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his provisional detention, he did not say a word.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of interning him in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all disturbed of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the case to be dismissed
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski’s lawyer again claimed Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, is dismissed for a sexual abuse case that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney for the director of "The Pianist", denounced before three California House of Appeals judges serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel stated: I claim that at this very moment the charges are dismissed, as the judge’s conduct in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, “resulted in a chilling outcome.”
According to him, Judge Rittenband (died since then) would have talked to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before issuing a sentence, which is a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and wanted" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared at the end of September "to have lied" to the documentary's author.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in the event that the court refuses to dismiss the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward at first instance, i.e. that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence for “illegal sex” with a minor under 13.
Since then, he has never walked the United States again.
Los Angeles District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “must be here to appear in the audience.”
With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that there is a possibility of escaping?
For her, the filmmaker "applies for a favor to the court, even though he disregards his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce their sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee".
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She claims that her client no longer tolerates being harassed every time Polanski’s case resurfaces, adding: “No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad cabin, pending eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses course and slows down the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a course, in a market that is being debated between better indicators than expected in the United States and the dollar rise: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology component Nasdaq lost 0.55 points to stand at 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index advanced 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will be maintained that way until the end of the year.
The trend was maintained thanks to the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which “helped improve market opinion as to the robustness of economic reactivation,” summarized analysts from Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence was visibly recovered in December, 73.4 versus 67.4 the previous month, according to a preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices slowed down by a new dollar advance that reached the highest level in the last two months against the euro, which “leads down to sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market fell.
The 10-year Treasury bond yield rose to 3.540% from 3.482 per cent on Wednesday night, and the 30-year bond yield to 4.497 per cent from 4.492 per cent on the evening.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month’s tour of South Africa, the 112 Miss World title candidates are on the final line to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second year in a row around Johannesburg, five of them already achieved their participation in the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Pearl Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Miss Athlete or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real riot.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
“I saw so many things and experienced countless experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, held for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, North of Johannesburg, starting at 5 pm (15:00 GMT).
It is impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, points out Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering “African landscapes that take away the breath”.
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press wheels and safaris, Miss World candidates focus on the contest.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to be able to follow the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of which became Bollywood stars.
Every woman’s dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
“We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown,” said Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade with traditional dresses and, of course, with a swimsuit.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee manager Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa proved to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride that are hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World contest.
Like last year, the candidates did a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Something unusual for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 FIFA World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've dealt with people I never thought I'd meet.
She's probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday 'very positive' news, according to his son David
News of Johnny Hallyday “are very positive,” his son David said Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his hospitalized father for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told reporters as he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1pm local time (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, relaxed, said he would move "as soon as possible" to the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered on Monday for an infection derived from the disc hernia operation last November 26 in Paris.
The musician is “in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent him from suffering and being able to administer his treatment,” the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday for an infection, following a disc hernia operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was operated once again from Wednesday night to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia was at the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by her daughter Jade, to witness a school event, a AFP photographer confirmed.
The head of orthopedic surgery and traumatology at the Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer last November 26 at the Monceau Park’s international private clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is a potential demand, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus claimed that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke directly to the doctor and was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem making the trip, as I was operated on twice hernia disc, he added.
Shortly before on the RTL station, he indicated that the singer had apparently "gone without a cannula, without anything", following his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She worked for actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a Neuilly-sur-Seine clinic where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed from a brain hemorrhage.
He is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by justice on several occasions for malpractice, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, an attorney for the Order of Physicians, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" sued "regularly" before the Order's Council, and is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
This indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause bleeding and therefore did not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems multiply since the summer, entered a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, to resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, seems very risky to me, Camus stated.
The UDF association raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt by the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Offer to Acquire) on the slogan of the former so-called all-successive party.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF, as he considers that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political legacy after having extended his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defense, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
In support of its management, it received the help of MP Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as it was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the UDF association office, controlled by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou’s friends who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to issue a request to the Minister and the deputy by inciting them to give up the seal and transfer their trademark ownership rights, his criminal lawsuit.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the UDF seal, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Alliance Cent.
They also believe it is right to continue using the movement's name, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, the signatories of the letter say.
As you know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to remove “immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from all support, as well as from its (your) website.”
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) brand to the legitimate rightholders".
Failure to do so will appeal to justice to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they specify that the UDF "is a true political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chosen" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Center has, according to them, no right to use the UDF.
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending the “material and moral interests” of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the brand", he was no longer a "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
Scandalously and fraudulently take advantage of the lack of registration of the UDF acronym to do so on your own.
This indiscretion is turning into a crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you are not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to sue the artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, she took advantage of the state of weakness of the octogenarian to exonerate her from a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos of the show, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose conviction consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000 fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter compete the reindeer of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to undergo such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors appointed this Friday will be required to submit a report before March 10, 2010 in which they will make it clear whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from states of weakness and during what periods.
I think you'll accept.
"I'm going to talk to her," Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said as she walked out of the courtroom.
For his part, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court’s decision.
It is excellent news (...) The experience will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years now, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has initiated criminal actions against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of taking advantage of his mother’s weakness for years to get a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or artworks.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the origin of the action brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ allegations turned out, on some occasions, to be a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer took into account three letters that her client would send (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she distrusted Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years.
Since his wedding, I could never talk to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise again.”
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor’s Office considered, once again, that the plaintiff was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardian judge refused, in recent days, to make way for her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before justice, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No one else will be able to appear in their place,” said Public Ministry Representative Marie-Chrsitine Daubigny.
Finally, the court decided that the judgment on the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers would be pronounced once the trial was carried out.
Is it a managerial revolution or an end to business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain.
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies with respect to their employees recalls the position of companies with respect to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees adhering to certain "values" from above as before it was about imposing on consumers products thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to the strategies of market conquest... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are not related to customer preference factors is repeated regularly.
Demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially R&D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) “requires all parties involved ... to have proactive behavior and a forward-looking view”; this requires a commitment on the part of employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian leadership.
For this reason, we call for a management revolution, which would be to put employees at the heart of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative utility.
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, incite the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In the beginning, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many laps, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
Second, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
-Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the ancient behavioral theory that American “neurosciences” recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely spread to their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the “commands” (sic) of the commitment of executives, a recent Ipsos investigation published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanistic management position, unsuitable for today’s world.
Identifying and Measuring Mobilization Factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises involves adopting a finalist view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating into all business management reasoning or practice, a fundamental fact: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to make reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from the Motivational Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivations.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined dowry that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilisation factors, business managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their “social performance” and relocate human resource management “on the spot.”
In this way, they create a favorable terrain for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: for the "just war" Obama receives praise from the right
On Friday, the American right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize has defended the concept of “fair war” against America’s enemies, hailed the speech Obama had delivered on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited the award’s delivery to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, said Mrs. Palin, a leading figure in the Republican Party’s right wing to the USA Today newspaper, and added that she herself had addressed the issue of “sometimes necessary” war in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he noted.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done “a very good job” in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, said the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For a moment, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, who some consider a potential Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear "a left-wing president" when he reminded Nobel committee members "that they would not be free or could deliver a peace prize if the force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush’s speeches and current chronicler in the Washington Post, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world,” as “always does,” he “spoke as an American president” by reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, a hawk of the Bush era, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech “monotonous, pretentious and uninspired” on the Internet National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the centre-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, although still believing Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech "superproduction" primarily for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo’s speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the Californian newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama "pronounced the speech that was necessary," the New York Times estimated, judging it "at the same time as gloomy and uplifting."
Road Transport: Three Marathon Negotiations to Ensure Christmas Supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the road sector unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organization that remained until the end, arrived on Friday afternoon at an agreement that ends the strike order and the threat that falls on the Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "happy" with the deal, after several negotiation sessions that began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators said goodbye early Friday in hopes of quickly signing the text according to the last hour of the morning.
Even when three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew giving a speech.
But a more than six-hour meeting that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict “would have been very damaging to businesses” and “it was feared to disrupt the end-of-year celebrations,” Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase of 4% for lower wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for higher wages (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
“It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage,” explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will order our militants that there will be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some dissenting rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this was "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common-sense agreement that respects employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable commitment".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3% and the holding of general road transport assemblies in the first half of 2010, which will mainly address the issue of extraordinary payment and modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that “a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million downturn in employer charges” was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 Bill of Correctional Finance, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "under the same terms."
TLF’s signature allows the agreement to be applied, firstly, to the companies affiliated with this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, in case the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
"It will be done as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced this as a “na<0xC3><0xAF>ve business,” as the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million “had already been pledged to the sector to offset some of the CO2 tax.”
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but in order not to contradict those who wish to eat turkey at the next dinner of Nochebuena, the Unostra lamented.
For OTRE, the agreement puts “the stability of many SMEs in the sector at risk for the next 12 months”.
RER A: conflicts over the weekend, trade unions disagree with RATP proposals
The conflicts at RER A, France’s largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, because at Friday’s meeting, the 2nd day of strike between unions and the RATP leadership, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their premium order.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, Saturday and Sunday will only run trains between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., due to a train of each two in the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and a train of each four on the other lines.
Interconnection with SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were pleased that “RATP strives to provide service to the big stores.”
The RER A crosses from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, approximately one in two trains ran in peak hours, and almost no trains in valley hours, as predicted.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the Andes thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than normal, especially due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had got up “an hour and a half earlier to arrive on time.”
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had foreseen the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from Cergy-Le-Haut or to this destination arrived or left Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general assemblies of strike workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, will be analyzed from a meeting that was held with the management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That’s not what drivers want to claim a premium they owe them, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT commented indignantly, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday to conduct “a more extensive analysis of the working conditions of the profession,” RATP said.
This also led the unions to say that the company “doesn’t care about weekend users.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers raided a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, who until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could extend to RER B on Tuesday, after the UNSA and the Independents have issued a warning.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (UNSA) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line with one million daily passengers.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for schedules with alternating shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday in favor of the dissolution of the country’s main procuring party, a decision that immediately sparked angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could complicate the government’s task, which has just given the Kurdish community a hand trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that undermined state independence and indivisible unity," the court's president, Hasim Kilic, told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a seven-vote majority was needed to secure the dissolution, Kili<0xC3><0xA7> said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are away from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the end of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 banks in Parliament (550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament before being parliamentarians without party label.
The decision follows a procedure launched by Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya in 2007, who accuses the DTP of obeying the “principles” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party says it has no “organic ties” to the PKK, but refuses to classify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court’s verdict comes as the government lends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights, so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thus end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a solution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan’s detention conditions have degenerated into clashes with police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large Southeast city mostly populated by Kurds.
The Order’s forces threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov bombs or stones with hondas.
In Istanbul, about one hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, T<0xC3><0xBC>rk claimed that the court’s decision was going to “deepen the discouragement.”
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
First, we oppose the closing of the games.
This is not a solution, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack in which seven soldiers died three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowfalls can start suddenly.
A really cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is absolutely something that you want to make life impossible for citizens, comments the director of road maintenance in the winter of the FES
But with this, your employees can learn to test and master all of the vehicle technology.
Meteorologists may announce it for the first time this weekend.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to deal with snow and ice.
In this case, the ESF acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as snow profusely in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A-frames come out with large vehicles with salt, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
But also access to the body of firefighters, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sections with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
The FES service starts around 3 a.m.
They should be covered approximately 1,040 kilometers, as necessary, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That’s why the ESF starts around three o’clock in the morning, “with it the lanes are free until peak hour traffic begins.”
The hardest thing is when it starts to snow around 7:30 a.m.
“So we have a problem,” says the road maintenance director in winter, “because then no one is ready to clear space for vehicles with salt.”
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it touches the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e also belongs.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That's where the trouble is generated, you know, Brauburger.
Around five o’clock in the morning the ESF infantry is launched, the dangerous and cruise points are cleared mainly.
Usually the FES could not take over all of the bike lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22 to 4:30 does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, comments Brauburger.
As these become slippery quickly, the salt vehicle is started as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The Dinosaur's Cradle
The Tawa hallae had the same appearance as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: a two-metre-long, 1.50-metre-high animal running over the two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with hip-shaped claws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Science magazine Thursday.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangea in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt said.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the propagation and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began a 2006 excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes, we have found in one day a dozen dinosaur bones, this is something unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a member of the Utah Museum of Natural History team.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remains of five specimens were collected in total.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an exceptional finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, comments Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion currents, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when the sauris were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as the "long neck" of the saurisau, and their relatives, the orchivosau, and their relatives.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in the skull of Tawa findae the researchers found evidence of air bags, such as those that also possess the descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa findae also the bones of the spine were obviously partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive air bag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the later giant sauropods also possessed air sacs and light bones, it was likely that the common ancestors of both groups would already produce this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers deduce that the sauris first emerged there.
Consequently, the three genealogical lineages were separated at first and spread from South America across all corners of the Earth, which by then still formed a unique land mass, the Pangea supercontinent.
However, the facts say that the team found along with Tawa find the remains of two other not very closely related theropods.
The three cannot descend from a single related ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the study Science.
Of course, there are opponents as well.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn palaeontologist Martin Sander.
Their opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare sideline of reptiles to the Mesozoic dominant terrestrial vertebrates remains an enigma.
In the Triassic, dinosaurs still shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of present-day crocodiles and pterosaurs and many other saurids.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs expanded all over the world and many new species developed, while the kinship became extinct at the Triassic boundary to the Jurassic.
Success stories were not eternal.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, comments Martin Sander.
There may have been a massive extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to beat the contenders in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact slowed the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and international signatories.
Attend professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California.
There are teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police eviction of the busy casino at Goethe University in Frankfurt affected the world.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, although also from higher education centers throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with students protesting on the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Estler, president of the university, ousted last week the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike because the walls and artworks were covered in propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damages, the signatories judge, do not justify “the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and professors by a police command.”
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive approach to vandalism served to “delegitimize and criminalize protest” and diverted attention from content.
The Governing Council has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the legal claim.
Most of the occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimized protest
Young people from the Verdi trade union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of growing concern for the future itself, Verdi’s national youth secretary, Alexander Klein, said in a statement.
Eva K<0xC3><0xBC>hne-H<0xC3><0xB6>rmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen, however, defended the performance of the rector of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in an issue of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the Wiesbaden provincial parliament.
“We are understanding with the protest, but we are not understanding with vandalism,” said Peter Beuth, a provincial parliament delegate for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of thoroughly studying the students’ arguments and demands, they are evicted.
The Left has tabled a motion, in which the Minister of the Interior is requested to submit a report on police intervention.
The new Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapons research.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the scientific headquarters of Riedberg in Frankfurt, with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign in Frankfurt a "close collaboration protocol".
Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Selengrad Mayor Anatoly Smirnov headed the Russian delegation; for Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 they will travel to a seminar in Selenograd representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural sciences research center.
Scientific exchange (disambiguation)
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses business relationships.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to put a foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is home to major Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika consortia.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "City of Socialist Planning" for arms research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "Green City") was named after the landscape of forested mountains, in which research facilities were established.
Stuttgart's brakes
The Stuttgart 21 Dimension is not set high enough for anything.
For the supporters of the project it is simply and smoothly about "the new heart of Europe".
The S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate to the capital of the Banden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg region a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Rail terminals, which end in the middle of the city, were then considered 19th-century engineering fossils, which acted as brakes for modern rail traffic, as it used to take a huge amount of time to hook the locomotives back and forth.
Roll, stop dry to continue the journey; but so it must be done.
And that’s why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is about half the route of the trans-European operating lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will actually be launched, even though the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement the reduction.
The railway terminals of course also have no further problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's carriage at both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new stretch built by ICE towards Ulm will already be started.
Federal and local politicians have arranged it this way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the large individual infrastructure projects of the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the graphics generated by the designer's computer.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The pass station and road support are designed for the transportation of people, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time, there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first be concerned with strengthening the transport of goods, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than that carried out by trucks on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That is the official figure.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing in other narrow crossings and passages on the network.
A total of 60 major projects are on the Ministry of Transport's list.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the route has been slowly being built.
It would be urgent here to step up the accelerator as it is due.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for the international transport of goods: through the heart of Europe.
The government is considering the decision on the airport.
The federal government leaves the Wiesbaden autonomous parliament to appeal against the decision on the ban on night flights of the Hesse administrative court.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have entrusted experts with the legal investigation of the more than 400-page sentence of the VGH, according to Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had reasoned in writing on this date that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport, the federal state would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as provided by the federal government, would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide until January 4, if it will file an appeal against this ruling.
The opposition criticized this delay and pressured government representatives to give up the appeal before the nation’s Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises to ban night air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of words.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to fulfill his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP slogan "We fulfill our word".
Minister Posch rejected Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel’s recrimination, which the federal government would be trying through law-enforcement misrepresentations and tricks yet get its night flights.
A thorough legal investigation would take quite a while.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally unstoppable decision, said Stefan M<0xC3><0xBC>ller (FDP).
As represented by the opposition, it would never have been his group’s claims about the night air traffic ban.
U.S. banks are returning the aid.
The major U.S. banks shaken by the crisis are stripped of their state bonds.
The “Bank of America” returned at one time the aid that the Tarp bank rescue fund had loaned him a total of 45 billion euros (approximately 30 billion euros).
And the Citi group also plans to return state aid, according to a report by the US CNBC.
With this, the institutes intend to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had made approximately 19 billion cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took it from the box itself, which had plenty of means, among others for the sale of items.
Bank Director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort to absorb the investment bank into the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also aims to raise money in the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations to the state.
The CNBC reported from a source of known circles, that the U.S. bank could announce by Thursday the increase in its capital by $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not want to comment.
Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their aid in June.
Quick selection
In the end, everything was faster than we thought.
Just two weeks after the administrative board of the ZDF (German television channel) presses the editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel can present a successor.
Last night, the group wanted to vote for the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the ZDF’s main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the broadcaster, officially so as not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced the failure to further harm ZDF director Markus Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, if this proposal would not be approved on the board either.
Frey, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the guild.
The result of the vote was not yet finalized at the closing of this edition.
Two weeks ago Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter failed on the board with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender's contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union on the Administrative Board had already indicated weeks before the election that they were not going to support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the Hesse government president, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument, which under Brender’s direction the ZDF’s information would have lost audience indexes.
Until just before the elections there were protests due to this, in which the political influence on the ZDF was flagged.
In the end, 35 experts in public law had even intervened in the debate, which called Koch's procedure unconstitutional.
But it didn't do any good.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy, and Romanesque philology.
He then worked on the station "S<0xC3><0xBC>dwestfunk" and the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the "heute-journal" newsletter.
The following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; up to 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; up to 2001 director of the ZDF foreign policy; since then director of the ZDF study in the capital.
The Greens party announced a constitutional lawsuit following Brender’s dismissal, which was even voted as a journalist of the year by the media magazine “Medium Magazin” on Wednesday.
Koch’s opposition on the board, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government, explained last week that the federal states should change the ZDF state agreement in such a way that the director’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a political-motivated majority.
A withdrawal of political supporters from the ZDF’s control groups was dismissed by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the board with an intelligent move: he strongly criticized the guild for dismissing Brender.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence both Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter was able to appoint him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote for him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a secret partisan.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is anyway awarded to the liberals of the left.
College Careers Are Clearing Out
Partial success for students: after a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federal states finally surrendered. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university principals, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of licensure and more.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the test load: basically each race module must end with a single exam.
It is also intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
The policy and the universities also want to simplify the recognition of test results between the universities inside and outside Germany.
The federal states are committed to more flexibly crafting the structural rules together for Bachelor and Master careers.
Regulations of the federal states which differ from this, should no longer exist.
Fewer Exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the principals of the universities have continuously talked about the improvement of being able to successfully pursue and complete a career (studyability).
This is the first time a specific content has been discussed.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with a single exam", said in a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
With the "sensitive reduction of the test load" it is intended to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future "studyability" should be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as to the unnecessary restrictions of the students in the choice of..
the courses.
Students would have “the right to get more space, enabling and encouraging their own initiative.”
These rules would apply to new races, but also in the examination of already existing races.
These must be "re-accredited" again every five years, but this would mean that it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be at the country-wide level 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which is installed by the federated states.
Education and culture ministers urged federal states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the number of subjects and examinations were not too strict or demanding.
In some federal states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with the ministries to take such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Palatinate has ensured that additional means are provided for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student mentoring and counseling programs, as well as strengthen exam offices and overseas.
The federal state and universities intend to have <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million available for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wants to bring a college law novel to parliament.
According to her, a single exam should be sufficient for the completion of a career model.
The career setting should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of assessments at other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all races about their "studyability".
On Thursday, the government and opposition again discussed the conditions of studying in the federal state.
Apart from the compliments, there were also criticisms about the decisions.
At the federal board of the Juso (young socialist) university groups it was demanded that the configuration of educational policy should no longer be carried out “behind the closed doors” of ministers and university principals.
At the latest after the education strikes, now the students as principals involved should be able to comment as well.
The president of the board of university rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave his support to the students: “We need the students’ experience,” she said Thursday in a meeting with the Education Ministers, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) Bonn agreements were not quite enough: the union requires a legal right for every student with a Bachelor’s degree to access a subsequent Master’s degree.
In addition, the federal states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are in the future sufficient study places for Master with the best possible study conditions. This was reported by a member of GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master, the Ministers of Education made no comment.
More than a footnote about Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller
“Entering and exiting Germany is done virtually without control,” says the first line of a lyrical poem by Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner in unbalanced idiomatic fragments, in which he discusses the experiences of arriving in Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom, but lost the environment of his language.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children's book publishing house, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner was awarded several literature awards, in 1993 he taught memorable poetry lessons or talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He said that he spoke quite a bit last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his Securitate files"
Visiblely insecure and ashamed, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner read a statement in which he admitted participation as an IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner had received the German Language Award.
Recruiting attempts had begun slowly, in early 1971.
“I am therefore someone who did not defend himself sufficiently against attempts to provoke the fear of the Security,” S<0xC3><0xB6>llner concluded.
The lyrical Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and her unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene is shaken, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that highlights the absolutism and evilness of a political system, which is based on and controlled.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is, from what we know so far, not only the author, but also the victim.
In his Securite IM file Walter had played a role, said literary scientist Michael Markel after S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of IM Walter.
He had excused or defended him at all points difficult for him, Markel said.
“I feel the moral need to make this statement,” he said.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies from the Securitate-Spitzel gewesen, Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller wrote in July in the weekly Zeit, after reading her own 914-page dossier.
Those involved will surely have speculated and will have known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the handling of the security control files is still quite widespread.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and made difficult in recent years.
A National Council for the Enlightenment of Securities Records (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler Authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of records since then is rather given to traces.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of records.
An interview, after the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Literature to Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, proves that the influence of former members of the Security in Romania is still quite large. In this interview a former head of the Security of Temesvar talked about the decoration in a derogatory way.
"She has psychosis", in the end they only questioned her once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to be shown without turning in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the S<0xC3><0xB6>llner case, as so many times when there are silent blaming.
The calm reaction of the listeners to S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s confession leaves us with the expectation that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the desires of knowledge and not so much by the awarding of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller’s work, which yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature, it is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as a garnish to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the supplier of his team, approached a Mercedes-class C-class taxi a quarter hour after midnight, he gave the impression that a member of the elegantly-dressed outdoor service was making the hubarb at a very hubarb-like display.
The man of the bald feature had hired a driver, because he still did not know the city.
By the way, he could have also driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and the 55-year-old was not drunk with joy either.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow I would start work again.
It would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days earlier: "It is true that we reached the eighth of the final", that is, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 victory against Unirea Urziceni of Romania, "but we cannot be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The “much more important task” was waiting for them next Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly shown again, after the fast three goals of Marica (5), Tr<0xC3><0xA4>sch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sorting
The eighth round of the Champions League final (matches on 16/17 and 23/24 February/matches on 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy was limited by the fulminating entrance of Babbel's successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, which in a short time had inspired the distraught Stuttgart professionals confidence in themselves, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more launched, Soul Repairer Gross explained his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with therapist Babbel had no effect anymore.
He unfolded a certain magic, Babbel's supporter, Jens Lehmann, accepted, "when a new impulse arises in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a several-week break due to an injury immediately advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the “phenomenon” perceived with the proverbial “fresh wind” and the way the new boss works: “He is a disciplined man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
And this was what was missing, obviously, when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, sports director Horst Heldt warns
But VfB Stuttgart needs, above all, consistency.
Like Gross, the players and the manager also abstained from overestimating the victory against a defense weakened by lack of relief and totally overwhelmed by the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with 0:4 had come the sad awakening, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still far away.
We haven't overcome the problem yet.
That Heldt was unwilling to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his home for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were re-updated in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which was granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, faced Heldt’s harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had blamed weakness in the direction of the board, which had decided to change from coach to pressure from teenage fans.
Also that he had eliminated his free day after the games, Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” Heldt said, and announced consequences for the backman.
They probably won't be friends forever, the two quarantines.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without the previous efforts with the substitute coach’s team, it would not have been possible the show of great game and battle strength.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important part in the success," Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; and the man in the plastic bag also agreed.
Battle of the World Heavyweight Championship
Burning duel in Bern: over and over again challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The trial of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains a world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion won Friday night in Bern over American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was his third successful defense of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knock could not be performed that everyone had expected.
Klitschko extended his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Arena of Bern, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower, who had proclaimed before the duel the end of the Klitschko era, was again and again avoiding the blows of the world champion, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right to his goal.
In general terms, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie", who "knows not to do anything".
During the weigh-in, the champion was allowed on Friday to remove Johnson’s sunglasses from his nose “so he could see his eyes.”
Fourth victory after the return of Klitschko
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a break of almost four years, he defeated then-Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered his WBC belt, which had previously had to be delivered without a fight.
That year he won in his defenses of the title to Juan Carlos G<0xC3><0xB3>mez of Cuba, and in September to Chris Arreola of the United States.
In this fight I only got one hit, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the Britishman David Haye, after he dethroned in November Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall.
In the previous summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September.
Supposedly, the company promoting it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the head of the Greens group, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defense a liar, Gutenberg, because of false information about the Kunduz case.
The SPD and the leftists demand explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the most recent revelations about the Kunduz air strike, the opposition has accused the Minister of Defense, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), of having cheated with knowledge of cause.
In Saturday's "Tagesschau" newscast, broadcast by the ARD television channel, the head of the Greens group, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin, said the minister "knowingly had not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, which Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that this attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel has to clarify whether an intentional murder strategy is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy, and whether the chancellorship, army and information service have approved this new strategy, demanded J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin and his Greens colleague Renate K<0xC3><0xBC>nast.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, resolutely rejected the criticism.
The chancellorship exerted no influence on concrete actions by the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, they had also raised doubts about the presentation made by the Ministry on the grounds for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on convoys.
Officially, it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed delicate details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials, it was far from clear that they had even pointed to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report of a field patrol.
However, Wichert reportedly requested in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
No response has been received so far, he said.
The ministry did not make a statement on Saturday regarding the accusations made against him, and noted that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament's inquiry committee, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Dreamworlds
In waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mental patients and drug addicts, the boundaries between imagination and reality disappear.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is fine.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can effortlessly surrender to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, those who experience sleep-like states during wakefulness, or see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are often regarded in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as maniacal.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drug addicts.
Guilt has our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes make the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality blur.
Altered alert states of consciousness may appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Casta<0xC3><0xB1>eda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain has been derailed—especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, and acetylcholine—and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disrupted.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts appear.
Gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness to the dreamlike states", for Sigmund Freud, sleep was even "a psychosis, with all-purpose forms.
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
His body is two-dimensional and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over him, it is floating near the roof of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red cheeks like blood, deformed, grinding teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Strict and evil voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult him and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two wires out of the stereo, ties them together to form a hook knot, and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
It rises in a bocina and puts the knot around the neck.
Let's go.
The rope is loose.
What a lesson!, the voices cry out in a chorus that the eardrums say to him, "Go to the clinic and have them heal you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause of this was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, taking medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, for three years he has been married.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside world and the inside, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, relationship disorders, or persecution.
Especially widespread is hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the doors to a stream of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician at the General Psychiatric Clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time it enters into a passive role, as in a dream, it feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced hallucinations once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, “the spatial and sensory structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is.”
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations rely on reality, the distancing of experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still an unknown why our brain makes cabriolets.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can lead anyone to lose contact with reality on a temporary basis.
But not all people develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that in addition to genes, there are other determinants.
The researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain’s neuronal maturity is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains an unknown how that alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which also does not manifest at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when a previous disposition already exists.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain’s transmission system.
When the brain heats up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive medications to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experiment with some, says L<0xC3><0xBC>beck’s professor of psychology Erich Kasten.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or does not often depend on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreale Welt in nostrim Kopf, published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, along with psychic disorders such as personality limit disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, and cranioencephalic trauma.
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are usually repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or under-cohibited; when our brain is hot, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this condition in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of love or other exceptional brain states.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lifetime.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and attending a secondary school.
A common girl.
If not for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, it happens that a dull boy with long, dark hair directs his word.
When she answers, the other students look at her surprised; no one, other than her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
He is awake and sees and hears that boy, just as he sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You may even feel your presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes you wonder if you’re crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class he sometimes cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains in a visible and audible way the mathematical equations.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While he waits in the dark room for the dream to come, which often comes late and is scarce, he cannot tell whether he is awake or dreaming, whether the images he sees, the cheeks or the girl with bloody cuts in her arms and legs, appear in front of his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, he screams at the figures.
His parents and friends didn't tell him anything, they'd think he's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
He approved last year of selectivity and lives with his boyfriend.
A year ago the hallucinations disappeared.
Since he's been in contact over the Internet with psychologist Kasten, he knows he's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art by desperation.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he begins to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unoccupied and it takes care of itself to look for entertainment.
Sarah K., the only daughter, had little fear of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he called Dad since he used reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, to those affected like Sarah K. They find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is projected there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, so they seem so real.”
Kasten also classifies nocturnal fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate his hallucinations as a special skill.
Boundary situation between sleep and hallucination
in this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences usually get pathological, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as being a dream.
Dream hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that later can not differ from being awake.
Dream-conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis being completely conscious. die bei vollem Bewusssein eine motorische L<0xC3><0xA4>hmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or of the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with a world of its own and imaginary that is detached from reality.
A form of boundary situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, there is a change in the world, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way to give meaning and interpretation to an inexhaustible situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich also describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action to save the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on several-day trips after a heart valve operation with heart transplant included, while his body was doomed to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen was immersed in a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he was seen lying in bed, an older man on board a sanatorium on a train, a robot watching over his health.
It was seen in the High Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with snow firn and met a Korean mobster.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later on in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intense even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilute the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, onirism, psychosis, hallucinations, and the consumption of narcotics show how fragile the inner reproduction of external reality is, even when we are awake.
Every change in the state of consciousness, says psychologist Kasten, “can lead to a distortion of what we call reality.”
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow may come
Burda
Children will be in charge of the publishing house at the age of 27
The new editor Kallen has come to a temporary solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, commented SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two children become heirs at the age of 27 and have a strong desire to enter the company, confirmed Burda, 69, to SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if you are trained for it.
One cannot put 7,500 workers in front of their children, if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end with the children and also the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will retire from the presidency of the board from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52, has been a member of Burda’s management since 1999.
At first, he was responsible for technology.
After the departure of J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Todenh<0xC3><0xB6>fer, he also took charge of direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no member of the family occupies the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old. His son Felix, who would now be 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s designation also serves to, “save the differences of 10, 15 years,” according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda stated that family businesses are also not safe from decay: “This has always affected families who get infected by the desire to seek capital, who have judged badly and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I've never had "delirium of greatness," Burda says.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don’t want to play with “Time” in the world league; those businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Everything you can wish for, within the reach of your hand, in terms of beauty and well-being.
This is what seems to have been proposed El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the commercial center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and pampering of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious signatures such as Hedonai - which deals with laser hair removal - Spa, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which owns a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teapot stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner as you contemplate the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to set up your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and taking a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities Spa offers.
In total, 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to carry out the latest and newest facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to virtual 'trainers' that guide the steps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key on a touchscreen, located in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
Your director assures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through hairdressing, the Luis & Tachi firm has a room where hair recovery rituals, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.
Varied necklines
Christmas is approaching and you never have to go through the looks of the stars again to adapt them to our festive wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric car
The electric company Endesa, together with the City Council of Barcelona, have created the 'Live Office'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'Live Office' (Logistics for the Implantation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the implementation of the electric car in the city and will achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, it is intended to drive what will be the transportation of the future.
3 ‘Electric Cities’
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to boost the implementation of the electric vehicle.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
This is intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
Among these would be activities related to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates when it comes to promoting the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has assets in a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, envisions "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the Economic Report of the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures that the Executive has put in place throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production plants,” said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the availability of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Plan for Automotive (PIA), targeted 800 million projects from 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilised an investment of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The chief executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed government measures to support demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, applied in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew by "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and motorists.
This initiative will be developed during the 5th to 7th February 2010 at the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will you be able to find classic motorcycles and cars, but at ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all kinds related to the motor world.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic engine that will make the delights of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Mos Classics and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche car sales and restoration; or Classic Car, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Skill Tests Abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Salon will be completed with parallel activities: holding of concentrations, sporting exhibitions, skills tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be conducted on a circuit enabled outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sports
Mazda wants to show that sportiness is not tied to respect for the environment.
For this reason, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stop and start system – dubbed i-Stop-, a device that at least for the moment is only available with the 150 horse gasoline 2.0 engine.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good note achieved as a whole.
Finishes, vehicle termination, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting at the driver’s seat, we found that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and grip.
The touch of the steering wheel is also exquisite.
Following with the set formed by the dashboard and console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, that also presents the Honda Civic.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this Japanese compact features more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
All this adds up to a large suitcase with regular shapes.
The engine’s automatic stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-litre and 150-horsepower petrol engine and with manual six-speed change.
This engine is a true delight. It excels for its fineness, its reduced noise, its performance and for achieving a contained consumption.
And while the most demanded Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers a year should not discard this i-Stop with a petrol engine, both for its high driving comfort and for its content consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is called Sportive, i.e. the one that incorporates a greater number of standard elements.
The standard equipment especially stands out the track change assistant (RVM) which eliminates dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioner and bluth and flood sensor.
In addition, although its equipment was scarce, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bison headlights and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Concluding
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, their behavior and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not do many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the petrol engine 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us large doses of satisfaction every day.
"Premiere" of luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality from the hand of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars shone more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexys' in the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at mail, without even the possibility of seeing a certain type of attachments or browsing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is harder, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone’s data plan.
In view of its success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is as limited as its American counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, of about 12 euros per month, includes roaming all over Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it’s like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to check the mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and some good glasses to read the small letter.
The repeated European Commission earplugs to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (don’t stop being curious that it bears Fon’s name when it lacks Wifi) gets this kind of fees means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to dampen their data network.
Kindle is another good example, including book download traffic and other Internet queries.
No contracts and no gaits.
It’s a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month to month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a lifetime-access shopping option like the one Peek already has in the US.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my email on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it is a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's Fetish Color
Yellow is, without a doubt, the preferred tone of the first American lady.
If you’ve already attended Barack Obama’s inauguration as president of the United States with a dress and coat of this color, you’ve chosen the same to accompany him in, without a doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the Oslo gathering of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color – greenish yellow with bright reflections – the two times the outfit was made up of three pieces – dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric – and adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States was following in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat her dress.
But the fabric on which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for taking possession of it was a fat lace, in Oslo it is a printed velvet.
The accessories have also varied: half heel green shoes again, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: a collection on this occasion, wool releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had labor problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Women's Fecundity and Labour Trajectory in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working mothers have seen limited employment opportunities due to motherhood.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of cohabitation in couples and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an out-of-home activity, work part-time, or have an unstable job, first start cohabitation with a partner, advance first motherhood, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, delay cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
“Women aged 35 to 49 with fixed employment have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time from their life trajectory to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on motherhood, albeit less on the timing of mating,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that differentiates the age of women by getting married and having the first stem.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the older the age they marry and have the first child.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, those who have elementary and higher studies have been mothers for the first time at the 25.1 and 32.1 average, respectively.
“There is also another division among women based on their level of study.
While those who have elementary studies get married and have their first child before getting a stable job, those of middle or higher levels invest this sequence and give priority to getting a stable job as a pre-marriage condition and the arrival of a child,” Delgado explains.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the image of different products of the brand, tones the universal motto of 'Because I valgo'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l', one of the most elegant actresses of the international scene, thus joins other famous figures of L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the men's section, the cosmetics brand also features luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in "Lost").
The British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives – designers and models, yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony, which was held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, were voted Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's Poker
Manuel Vicent gives in 'P<0xC3><0xB3>quer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in some cases, also through the other).
It does not do so in predictable and scary genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but looking for something similar to the core of the creator character’s ignition.
The trip has its thrills and Vicent does not spare any fears or illuminations.
In addition to exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and rereadings.
Here are a few snapshots.
On his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same as I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against greedy fate, guiltless morals, and innocence without any god.
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: “Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh combined the thrill of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition.”
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the peaks of 8,000 meters of universal literature, which must be climbed through the northern wall, from which the best climbers are seen again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a rare guy.
Of himself, he once said that he was heir to a county landowner and others that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both of these dreams were grand.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the insane cry thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century in his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she got on her knees and prayed, 'Dear God, please stop writing like a woman.'
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'The dream after the effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after life hareth pleases death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage also brought his depressions.
The husband accepted with all normality that she told him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
There has never been the case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness.”
P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but pass on to Baroja for Faulkner's weapons?
What did it do but to abduct that man’s fame so that he might serve him as his own pedestal?”
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a specimen of mixed breed, rescued from the kennel and weighing no more than six kilos and, without a word, stabbed her to death.
Our outrage is overwhelming because we did not find the fun in a free aggression to a small, defenseless animal, which by the way, was tied up.
To this must be added the suffocation that caused a lady to walk quietly and that, when she raped these individuals, she came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energy that attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, with anyone who is even weaker than him.
The incident occurred at five o’clock in the afternoon of a Tuesday any by a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt that it serves for a long time and not to generate susceptibility, only to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to treat an defenseless animal for free that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for helmet use
The tire manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the helmet, mainly among the youngest drivers, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said the campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day,” and said it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informative actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum dissemination.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a tire manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safe products.
Increase the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, most importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of Anfac manufacturers and Ganvam sellers.
The good data, not osbtant, should be quarantined as the reference to which the comparison is made -November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease from the previous year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the rebound of the last month, the registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold, all the vehicles that make up the tailoring drawer of light commercials: derivatives of tourism, pick up, vans, light vans and light trucks/chasis.
Also, the nubarons that most affect your demand have not disappeared, because although they are also acquired by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, who pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
So to the constraints of the closed tap of bank loans, other factors must be added, such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In the face of this panorama and unlike tourism, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E has recently been used.
They can be accommodated, in addition to the individuals, the self-employed and SMEs who are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been witnessed.
Yesterday, Ganvam recalled the need to devote special attention on the part of the Administration to these vehicles and also to the industrial (trucks and buses).
The sales association forecasts a 2010 similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales (tourism and 4x4).
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory.
As with ABS anti-lock braking and ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all tourism and light commercial vehicles of new registration, while for the rest a period of absence is fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, due to its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions by scope.
The emergency braking assistant does what it does is to increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, which the system detects by the driver's foot.
But he doesn’t always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by the car component manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance the car uses to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided annually.
The reduction will be even greater – it is estimated that one in four accidents with damage to people would be avoided – when so-called intelligent emergency braking system is popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or a camera) detects the obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In the event that it does not react, and even if the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors Delays Plan for Opel Until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April – probably on the 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer concludes that he is going to need more time.
What Nick Reilly, GM Europe’s new president, intends is that each of the points of the plan has been previously agreed upon by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document that will be submitted to workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
GM, on the other hand, says that a decision on Saab’s sale should be made in the coming days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but takes on the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to China’s Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is maintained if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its ultimate, and expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to slim down nothing less than 80 kilos, which has left the scale in just 1,275 kilos.
This led them to dispense, first of all, with the automatic roof that has been supplied by one manually operated canvas, saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, 'falls' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank by 12 kilos and more, 7 to 54 kilos.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system brought another six kilograms and changing the door sliders for some cloth, the remaining kilo.
Although also offered with the double clutch PDK change, the test was performed on a six-speed manual drive unit, mainly by California’s secondary roads, in mountain stretches with really twisted tracks.
Their behavior can only be described as unstoppable.
The weight reduction does not imply that the car does not weigh the asphalt with aplomb.
Rather, the opposite: it was a long time ago that we did not test a model so small and light that, at the same time, transmit so much safety in the passage through the curve, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in a short walk for the necessary time, until we order him to sprint, brake, recover and re-express his motor...
Thanks to its address, as communicative as it is accurate, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is very accomplished and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine roar, already premiered previously in the Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, either from a standstill or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we passed through with the Boxster Spyder was quite punctual, but the car did dig well into the ditches.
The electronic aids barely made an appearance throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, already well in the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most fun driving that one can on the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70,831 euros.
"The Bag Girl"
Intimate of Karl Lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the 'maison' parades, the singer prodits her malotta face with as much contumacy as her Chanel pockets.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia is awarded a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant victory by 82-91 in his visit to the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite the numerous lows that Dusko Ivanovic’s team had, and in this way he is placed in the leadership of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, which was the best of eight (three-years).
The Victorian team was able to supply the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer until the end to make itself victorious.
In addition, the big hit from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored had a lot to do in the final triumph.
The match started from the front for the blues, which were put from the start forward on the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already made it presage that they had jumped onto the Israeli court with the hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main architects of the 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alaves team opted for Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was greeted with pitts and applause on the return to which his home was, to continue extending his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter’s ‘less than six’ rating already made the prediction that this was not going to be Brazil’s best night.
But the match, despite being set to rest, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their pitch they did not win anyone, and with 'the hand of Elijah' they managed to get into the match.
Eidson and Pnini decisively contributed to the 'yellows' turning the light (50-49).
More Disadvantages
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but not much less dead, needed to whistle a couple of plays with a hit to catch air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three triples almost consecutive and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a local reassuring income (57-67), who ended up with the finals.
The alaves left their skin in the last partial and English and San Emetrio (60-75) already warned that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had earned during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not give up and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by fouls, Ivanovic's didn't rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the game already had owner and the victory got away from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
The Unicaja lost badly in Greece to the Olympiacos and gave him the lead of Euroleague Group B, in a game marked by the cashier's losses, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not intimidated by the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship pavilion and not by the rival entity, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a great budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three triples in a row, two from base Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, plunged the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the locals' arsenal in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, gave him the round to score 22-20, minute 13, at which point an action, conato de fight, between the two U.S. bases Beverley and Williams, supplanted.
The Greek ensemble began to function by showing its superiority within both areas, where the low by injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal fouls of Carlos Jimenez, were hurting the cashiers.
Between the domestic players and the Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the lead 44-32, minute 19.
The Impossible Resurgence
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, who despite the 19 losses, showed superior and even equalled the difference of the match played in M<0xC3><0xA1>laga 66-48, minute 27, which made the leadership of the group tattle.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last down of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the encounter.
Despite all the inconvenience, the Unicaja by Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos when it tightened and given its superiority in centimeters within the area was unstoppable.
Croatia's Nikola Vujcic managed to lift the basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja turned out, giving the lead to the Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and engine in Spain.
The How much should you charge? tool calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is in operation, the searcher has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels ill-paid", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data Trovit has from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer earns 45,226 euros a year gross and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 that a Spanish one receives.
In the same way, a driver charges 34,247 euros net annual in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11,592 euros net annual; followed by a dependent, with 14,725 euros; and a worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are the driver’s, the half-day jobs and the social worker’s.
Brazil set a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian Government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, when he officially completes his term.
Francisco Catunda, head of business at the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he remains a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27th, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destination."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the set deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 election (where Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately frustrated by Zelaya's rejection of the status of political asylum that he intended to impose on him the "de facto" government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much
After the days of wine and roses since last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by an uncertain nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt by directly buying assets and indirectly giving liquidity-free bars at near-zero rates for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have practically ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand on the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the global economy’s ability to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the Stock Exchanges and the differentials of corporate bonds have rebounded, although they remain far removed from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk and public debt was again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the euro zone countries’ differentials with respect to Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this episode of instability but that’s where Standard & Poor’s arrived and threatened with a new downward review of the Kingdom of Spain’s rating.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not come badly to silence moral risk advocates who were once again trying to raise awareness of those responsible for global economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of credit restriction on job destruction, when what should be done is to decree a new day of action.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the emirs to recompose power in the emirates and that of Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides the public deficit, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to default on its commitments.
What makes sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to make its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are faced with an episode of the normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within what was expected.
In the Spanish case, as our public debt differentials expand like European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If European differentials decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
Standard & Poor's is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, which are reloaded with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy.
Again, it has all the paint that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudent, friendly driver".
Related Sectors
Iberdrola’s president, Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, was the first to intervene yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which Spain’s energy strategy is discussed these days over the next two decades.
After his intervention, followed by that of Gas Natural-Fenosa president Rafael Villaseca, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n gave the press a few brushstrokes of what he had raised in the closed-door subcommittee.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion by 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion between that date and 2030, as long as the nuclear power plants remain open today.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be intended to increase capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue is changing and power will have to be increased.
Their bet focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 new MW is needed, that is, with other "support energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act just passed by the Government is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to do blood with the real decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts climate change policies.
In his opinion, there is a "clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "pointing" measures, as Iberdrola's president called them.
Whatever the case, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, must begin to take place as they are already late in maturation and a stable wage framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the 'handling' of Aer Lingus in ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground airport services, Swissport, will play the preferred partner role of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports in which it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the most prominent.
The agreement, which has not exceeded economic terms, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Center for Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures.
The partnership includes an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the work of the center will be to investigate energy efficiency in highways and airports.
Drives its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
It fights for its first concession motorway in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and sister Hochtief are their rivals.
A 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, has become the closest option for Acciona to sit in the country as a road builder and concessionaire.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to move the project forward, in a business plan sponsored by Ernst & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to do the work and exploit the toll.
Expecting to present their bids next May, the planned investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 million euros) and in the last phase they compete three consortia with a notable presence of European builders.
The group dubbed Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish in liga, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian builders, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team he plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where they share the capital of the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, in turn participating in the ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the civil works firm Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises great works and privatisations, but it carries a clear difficulty of entry if it is not by way of the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has followed the mentioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, as well as Asian references, and which continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millionaire Assets
It acts as a bet for a geographical area of maximum importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, the Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of raising and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
Their intention now is to consolidate these two areas and leverage synergies to enter the fields of infrastructure construction and operation.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and named Northern Link (northern link), is called to link the western highway of Toowong with the bypass road at Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometers of tunnel.
The calendar marked by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December of next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will contribute 500 million Australian dollars ($308 million) to its funding.
Brisbane now offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable fruit to Hochtief, who announced yesterday the award of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
ACS will enable, through its local Leighton subsidiary, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will offer fast internet access to 400,000 people and will give work to the German for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has passed the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were yet to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale at 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, Laing O’Rourke will share the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia worth 64.5 million euros.
The firm gets this contract days after it is done with the expansion works of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The works are scheduled to begin in early 2010 and their lead time will be extended for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded the publicity of Renfe
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services over the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore for an approximate amount of three million euros annually, the railway operator reported.
The contract includes the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Mrs. Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that submitted to the competition convened by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
63 million to France Télécom for stopping competition
The competition regulator in France has imposed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million fine on France Telecom for anticompetitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony with the signing of exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs to consumers outside the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company accumulates more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560 million in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the authority that oversees the competition considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore re-incident.
App Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile subsidiary has followed in the footsteps of other operators and has opened an online app store, with the aim of increasing revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
In principle, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
We will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since it was born in 1992.
Both Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club to have won the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have come out of this division well.
The white club has been the third in the continent to have the most money to participate, and the only one, alongside AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the standings.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also paid more money to participate in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of the Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country to have achieved the most money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, for the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distributing
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to enter 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each match they compete.
There are also bonuses to win (800,000 euros) and to tie (400,000 for each team). The eighth finalists will receive three million each; the eight fourth finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be pocketed 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, compared to the finalist's 5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a, on the other hand, was pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones, and has four assigned seats.
The previous year’s champion remains with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played in this year’s edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday outlined the details of the share purchase offer with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos’s capital.
A percentage that does not oblige you to launch a public offer of acquisition (papa) for all of the securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share that would be disbursed in 10 years and that would be repaid with an interest for such a 1% annual deferment.
Yesterday Sos’ shares closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, Nueva Rumasa’s offer values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez Group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
The disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his direction.
In an attempt to stay away from possible purchase offers and from the judicial loopholes of its former directors, the brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar, announced the election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as director of internal auditing.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not exempt from controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to companies from the Salazar.
In fact, it can not be ruled out that over the next few months Sos unveils new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National Audience yesterday and said that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.

New tools to poison cars
In these days of temporary and accidents, not only do car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a sinescence are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what will be the cost of repair.
No sinister is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complicated job.
Manually calculate the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and workmanship, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the most recent computer tools would be a matter of minutes
That’s why nearly 100% of experts use these types of systems.
The service and solutions providers for disaster assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers, then preparing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with its products.
The other firms competing in the field of valuation and information processing tools in the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new car goes to market, these companies get to work.
It is a very hard work, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, of each model a "smart" graphic image is made where different parts of tourism can be "pinched".
If it’s a windshield model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models have information about Porsche, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that runs, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the preparation of the databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in developing these databases.
2.5 million data are included each month, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of the used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that can be provided to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard sinister evaluation solution, intended for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each evaluation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
After each insurance company, which performs thousands of expert reviews, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it exited the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle moons, and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the internet that allows you to hop on vehicles declared total sinister.
Their statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or knowing the deviations by model brands.
It can be studied, for example, how many models of a particular brand have gone through the workshop due to failures or how many have suffered serious disasters in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It commercializes, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official manufacturer times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdown or maintenance of the car.
The Gt Rating Guide is your historical reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has grown at a rate of 20% annually over the last three years, and in 2008 it generated 10,8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they began their internationalization process, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38%, in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Solara’s global turnover (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country the company will enter 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the Stock Exchange, and now its shares are quoted for a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Online Auction of Injured Cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or sinister special vehicles.
The transaction amounted to a disbursement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could be expanded next year to the remaining 15%.
The goal of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sales service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, workshops, retailers and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 daily ads are managed and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose frame number has been given off cannot be re-circulated, but it can be used as a replacement for certain parts that are not damaged.
Cars with historical value can be given highs even if they have been given lows after some frightful managements.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company guarantees that the user gets a budget in only four steps: identify the vehicle, look for the replacement, create a budget and generate a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, that to a greater or lesser extent they are more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 touring, 109 off-roaders, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it you need a computer with internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price of the labor, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the budget to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the client can finance.
The Audatex company is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inside face.
