Parliament has not ratified the amendment for Tymoshenko's release
The Ukrainian parliament rejected, as part of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymoshenko, the head of the opposition.
The MPs rejected in the second reading the draft amendment to reduce the penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the currently imprisoned former Prime Minister.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for making a pre-emptive deal with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The trial is not final and the court is expected to rule on the conviction’s appeal in December.
Tymoshenko called the regime's political revenge judgment and caused a process of suspicion of bias in the court also in the west.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libya's victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already defeated it.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As is customary in the region, the victors in the elections are Islamists, but they are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has enacted the customary law of the Sharia and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a flight we cut off our hands.
Women can forget the emancipation, the non-respective potentials of her faith are liable to capital punishment.
It is the Koran that will unite in place of the personality of the dictator the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya there will be such an order as we cannot represent it and as we certainly would not like.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best and would probably not be advantageous for the Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that the Islamist warriors have accepted help with the recognition of unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the strikes of NATO but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated at every attack.
So when it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam and our politicians turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily occupying Libya.
So there is no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crosses".
Is it true that without land occupation, oil companies will easily have access to Libyan black gold?
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of a disinterested protection of human rights.
As long as we prevent these followers of Sharia.
A new era of crisis has begun.
France and the rest of Europe are in the sights of investors.
A flashback of the statistics took place on Tuesday in Europe.
Each of the states published the relevant GDP information for 3A.
The Czech economy stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market beats all records.
Investors not only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries published their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter, during which Germany placed better than expected (an increase of 0.3% instead of the 0.1% expected), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was the cause of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that we are heading towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts’ forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter, according to planned and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts had predicted.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Ten-year bond yield is 28.45%
The returns on Spain and Italy’s obligations are climbing to critical limits.
The problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Czech bond yields remain below 4% while the situation prevails in the region.
Voices are heard in Germany to say that the ECB should be the ultimate guarantee.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The representation of football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Cech and keeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also defended its qualification with a good deal of luck in the second half and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and a great deal of luck for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
The Montenegrins were under pressure until the second part due to a precise Czech defence.
The match casualties were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box office.
From the first few minutes we played a football warrior.
The two teams were hard to come up with combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line.
The pressure of the national footballers did not come to pierce the Czech defense, which responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Spain created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center of Spain where uranium is transformed.
They thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in its latest report that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weaponry.
A possible attack on Iran's nuclear facilities is reported in Israel.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
In the case of an attack, the aim of which would be to destroy the Iranian nuclear program,the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the site of Natanz where uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: does not take breakfast and takes carcuterie for dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren weigh above average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models around him is.
On the tables of obese children, for example, carcuterie is found 50% more often than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of the obese had fries at dinner, according to the survey conducted with a awareness action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In the families of young adults, sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most schoolchildren today – only 15% responded that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 students from the primary schools in the Czech Republic.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by the General Health Insurance and the Unilever company.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third grade have signed up for this project.
One of the determining factors that cause a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children is the lack of proper nutrition and not enough physical exercise.
“Only half of the children surveyed indicate, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast—in case —breakfast —taste — dinner, which is one of the basic principles of a good diet,” says one of the survey results.
No breakfast and meatballs at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development it takes a few basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the families of the students eat at the same time.
In most families, everyone takes their own breakfast.
And the worst thing that has been found is that one-tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast, however, is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, unhealthy fries are more often consumed.
Almost every student – not to mention weight – drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of children surveyed do sports regularly, but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food based on opportunities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of cakes, meat and sweets.
“The most alarming thing is especially a great preference for sweet lemonade,” the survey found.
For lunch it is the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
The children did not want any feculants at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Head on Health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a review of a group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the awareness session "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was a strong desire to focus on healthy eating," the results of the survey said.
For example, the most notable was for sweet lemonades, as children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children have most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce sugary dishes and "knedliky" (Czech specialty of breadballs or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In an article about how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry that there was a lot of it from the beginning.
I didn't think about what was going to happen next.
The presentations of three professionals of the specialty, the dress of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it will be worse.
The closer we approach the final examinations, the more practical exercises and information are waiting for us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it's really "bored".
This time we discussed with Director Alenka (there are no boys in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women like that are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without a particular curve, another of overweight.
The stylist should know how to visually soften large arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We have come so to nicely emphasize the character and also not to dress in a too visible way the types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine size.
For example, if there is a difference between the size and the hips in such a way that the skirts or pants do not go at all,it is worth making it custom made.
And you will not regret it because the garment that falls flawlessly is priceless.
In a custom skirt you will feel much better than in the one that slides constantly, wraps and does not stick to the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance can afford a Tucker-style dress, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort out all the information received.
But I’m also afraid that considering what I have to do at home there is too much of it.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress for the day and the evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality fashion as well as its appearance.
I'm going to have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know about the Victoria Secret campaign.
At the bottom of me, it makes me happy, because it’s better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred pounds lately (don’t take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodboard, as they say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting on the graphic part of styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses physics in this way but creates productive pages in magazines (on products given the trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, entertained us with all of this.
But this,... until Sunday
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests of the specialty gave a diverse look to the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion photographer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single garment in a different way.
Variability is a prime example of this.
As for example this trench-coat which must be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with scorpions and take it in photo as a dress.
Or just pick up the sleeves or collar and immediately have a new look.
"Play with that," he said.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: “For the job you need to know the rules perfectly.”
"You can then start to contradict it," Jacob said.
Finally, I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, to what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
There are no statements about fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more clothing variants than those that are photographed.
That is, for a fashion story that will have a dozen pages (so a dozen models) I have to be ready to "retail" at least a fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to count on this in the course of creating a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make up half the success has been confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylist services remains fraught.
And the familiar faces sometimes consider them useless (it's enough that I know something but what I seem to pass in the second rank).
And if someone does a styling on our part, we then have to rely on the fact that he dictates to us with a high probability a completely different (smaller) size than the one he actually has.
We then have to navigate to google and make sure if the boulevard infos state the celebrity in question, if it has magri or grossi etc...
Honza and Mario put us at the heart on Sunday that it is not enough for the stylist to focus on fashion and know how to assemble models.
He has to communicate with the people he wears and it is so important to be a good psychologist.
To know how to guess people, not to flatter, to retain their opinion.
“When a manager asks you to sort his closet and fill it with new items you can’t throw everything away and say, ‘My God, what a horror.’
“You’ll find a few things you’ll find beautiful and he’ll advise you what to wear them with,” says Mario.
This one showed us concretely what must all contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
It’s the one you hang around the size and have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, hair rollers or food pins, there is also nylon yarn (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which one will not close one garment in the back or the other will be too big (if the pin is too big)
So that we are not just people who listen but who have tried something in a practical way they have taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could collapse, fortiori outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We had no right to touch the scissors so as not to injure ourselves inadvertently.
So we really need skills.
Mario made me happy when he congratulated me for my creation.
The countdown I'm reporting isn't for my girlfriend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second course weekend
I'm starting to understand more and more that styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, that everyone says what they want.
The need for speed The Run is being fought all over America.
Revision
Initially, a race without problems is transformed due to a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning shift at work.
It fulfills to some extent everyone’s ambition but it serves no purpose if no one wants to do something more.
The new subtitled part The Run produced great expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already aged Need for Speed racing series and to come out some sort of game from playable games that wouldn’t just count on points.
So we were curious as to how the added passages will be during which the main hero gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the set pulls down due to some useless mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible failure on the part of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are caught in the adventure whose main hero Jack has character problems and to solve them starts to take part in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then in more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on a different route and the planned steps in different environments that are quite different from each other and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are super nice even though the graphical technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
This is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in high snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
In addition, the tests are supplemented from time to time with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly decreases your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Apart from this, the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There is only a small number, but that is enough.
There are moments when you try to exceed the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the clock (classical duel with the timer) and then again you expect another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and who tries to make the situation difficult for you.
The new features are off-road crossings.
It is rather an interactive animation when most of the time Jack escapes in front of someone and you have to help him by tapping the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
As a result, this is a good thing because this element is not likely to interfere and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that enhance the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that there is nothing extraordinary at the moment, but it cannot be said to be negative.
As far as realistic simulation is concerned, you will have to go elsewhere.
But although one can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything is okay.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not yet fully developed.
We do not expect from this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not have, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, so it is not completely good.
During tight overtakings you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your self part in crazy turns.
Or it is found in ants.
Thanks to the reboot system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done so that when you have broken the figure or you have come out in the setting the game takes you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you need to restart the game from the beginning.
So it’s more a tool, in case something doesn’t happen as it should, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes the restarts do not help and you need to find the solution by remembering the track in question.
The great hic of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some twists that you have to go through in a certain way otherwise it does not happen.
Otherwise you meet in a given place "civil" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute late.
What gets angry are situations when you see easily pass the opponent between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you either have to set aside and turn them around or brake them.
It doesn’t matter if you go ahead of him because it’s “calculated” in such a way that for the given situation it always happens very close to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
During all the time in the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent who precedes you in the same place.
This annoys the most at the end of the game when you ride on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The opponent must pass in front of you at all costs.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you come into collision a lot of times.
One can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it’s a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don’t have time to follow everything that happens.
And it doesn’t matter if it’s because of the concept of 50 unique itineraries, that the order of the races is such that there’s no chance of getting bored or anything else.
The original idea is to change the car during the races.
You need to pay attention to gas pumps on the routes as you can change cars there however most of the time the one you have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large U.S. cylinders for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic twists on the very technical lines for example on the lace roads in the mountains.
And the challenge mode, which are races in particular places you know about the adventure, goes very well with the main regimen of the story.
Not only do you receive medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog feature which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other features in the community.
One of the most difficult shots to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the roads (it looks like).
Your speed indicator shows you between 150 and 200 km/h (previously) and behind you comes a subway branch that sends the car directly to the railroad.
At the editorial office we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought about creating this game or whether the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is disturbing is that in more extreme situations, the imagery does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This is especially true of accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is the choice.
In order to please as many and especially the most young audience a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
The general impression of Need for Speed: Le Run is therefore really confusing.
If the game didn’t have those stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it’s the best production of NFS in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
The fun is really good but prepare yourself for the mistakes to get in your eyes with the power of an aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
“I didn’t expect such a hard war.”
"It will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," Milena Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law, the Czech ambassador near the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various EU bodies and their relations in such an understandable and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers at Charles University’s Faculty of Law might envy her, she showed how much she takes her motto “understandable and open to Europe” about it.
Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticisms resonated that he's a fade, that he's a roundabout, that he can't fulfill any mission and I have to say that he's cut everybody's breath because he keeps his role to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "What phone number should I call?", so as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater readability of the Union's policy vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis the states.
Nobody wants to ban us our syrecky (cooked pasta cheese that feels very strong)
Ms Vicenova also noted the agenda she has lived, lived and will live on in the near future by the European Council.
She called the Czech presidency a success two years ago.
The Czechs have resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or have organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
It called the fall of the government very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
According to the words of the Ambassador, "activity has beaten its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to resolve even now.
It is also necessary to approve the new seventh budget of the Union, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it would seem that the budget will be thin and for savings, what branch will be the priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, is all to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a Europe that is understandable".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted cornices, bananas differently large or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky.”
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, she says, is due to several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and low support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when Polish, Magyar, Slovak come to me, this Frenchman says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what's this Visegrad group doing?' and he's not happy at all."
According to Vicenova, in the near future there are tough new rules on budgetary policy that await member countries.
This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not multi-speed Europe, which prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
“We have countries in the eurozone and others outside the eurozone.”
“We have the Schengen area, we also have the enhanced cooperation institute.”
In the first place it was said that the countries that want it cooperate with each other and those that do not want it remain in their corner."
"There will be a lot of institutes of this type and there will be a truly two-speed Europe," said Vicenova.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all issues affecting the EU should be discussed among all EU members and not just members of the euro area.
History of a brand:
IBM Innovator Begins Second Century of Its Existence
If someone were to look for the word that expresses the IBM strategy as closely as possible, the closest would be “long-term.”
For a wide audience, IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm feeling as very current and yet it has been a hundred years since its creation.
The basis of this long-term strategy was laid by the firm’s first head, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved so little that people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" became the imprint around which the life of a giant future will unfold (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was the basis of the company’s culture carefully developed by Watson.
For us, IBM means a long-term thinking of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it remains true to its core values and yet has not been afraid to change everyone else around it.
This has allowed us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more” the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano has delayed for the anniversary.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to take care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic – the people of IBM were the only ones among the first U.S. employees to have paid vacations, an employer-paid insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system for rehabilitating them.
In the same way, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was at the beginning brilliant in the discovery of talent – as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and thus could have the choice.
The current plan is entirely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman – Virginia Rometty – who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been working at IBM for thirty years and currently serves as Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has in recent years been doing what is called jamy, online brain-storming from which many future strategies and innovations have come.
It’s not surprising that there are a lot of ideas – in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that assures it a safe position in the field of business.
“Since the beginning IBM had a concept rather of an institution than of a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor of economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve business problems using its technology,” said Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating that market.
IBM - or the "Big Blue", as it is familiarly called in the United States with regard to its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the world's largest firms.
It is, of course, the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, services at the level of server products up to nanotechnology.
She holds many patents from all U.S. tech firms and five of her employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries is, for example, the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the barcode or the floppy disk.
IBM found itself this year with $220 billion, the second-largest technology company by market capitalization (the first being Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
These are not all innovations and fabrications that have had the preference of the customer and of the time - for example, IBM did not manage to bet on a clean OS/2 operating system, Prodige online service or the IBM PCjr computer:
“From the moment your business is built on the forward movement you can’t emotionally stick to the past,” notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don’t work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft competitor that basically stands and stays under the Windows operating system.
A Perspective Technology
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardware, have a predominant place.
However, back in 1990 it was with more than the strongest hardware participation motive.
From the year 2000 IBM sold low-performing assets for $15 billion, during that period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of forward-looking technologies.
It continues to invest and even from 2008, when it for the first time surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis has also increased its investment volume.
Is it now obvious that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
The price of IBM stock has continued from 2008 onwards in a 120 percent rocket, the firm’s net profit continues to grow.
IBM’s logo is to change everything but not its values.
For this we can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
IBM History: From slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York City a hundred years ago; it originally had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is related to the 80s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 presided over the Supervisory Board of the company.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then shadowed the firm’s founder – it was Watson’s ideas that so far have been based on the identity and culture of society.
Watson led the firm almost in 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson’s leadership, revenue increased to $9 million and the firm’s expansion began in all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of management it was his son who occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM's people and computers helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight to the Moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first computer family, the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer factory to Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the company from Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to take care of advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been successful at IBM over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept “a smarter planet”.
Its objective is the intelligent utilization of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and city management.
As far as the business area is concerned, IBM recently developed a “Smarter Commerce” platform that helps traders manage the entire business cycle.
IBM also has a strong history on our territory.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 and was the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center of Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team that deals with the recognition of the word.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep this donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years) said it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and established clear rules for the future life.
“Pepa can come home, but not as my partner,” Rychtarova said.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in the summer to Bartosova in her house, she did not doubt that her couple would not hold.
When Iveta insisted after 30 days to move from Ricany, Pepa did not push the singer back.
And he admitted publicly that he loved him.
With time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's bond and ended up saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova are separated there will be no wife to welcome her on the doorstep of the house.
“He’s my son’s biological father and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will put him out.”
“He will no longer be my old beloved and lost donkey, but a man with whom I have a special relationship,” Rychtarova said, pointing out that she has separated from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door is not a problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I will stay with Iveta and I will not change."
“My wife set up a wedding on paper and I respect it.”
"Society continues, I take care of repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
“We talk to Darina in a completely normal way but we don’t sleep together,” Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop it.
“We don’t sleep together and I’m not interested in knowing where she’s going, with whom and if she has a relationship.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with “Iveta and I take full responsibility for myself,” Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: Does this concern you too?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all of them, like each other, are able to get them out of their “hands”.
Ladies and gentlemen, you will know in the following lines the female vices that reach to pump the blood of the veins of men.
The Purchases
Does your half make you remarks that you are addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one piece of clothing per week?
Are you happy to buy and package at the time of the sales?
In your case, we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think that they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you would say, who would resist the window sill of clothing stores, look for beautiful clothes for themselves and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buy either a hobby, it can become a real hell for the man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse that he was waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
“I would need to lose at least 5 kilos – should I start doing sports?”
"Do you like me?"
Don’t these phrases remind you of something?
- Yeah?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the higher the frequency of these complaints, the more poisonous women become.
Odor and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite manage.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum, clean the floors, make the dust, decoup the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they have salt the sink, crushed the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you are suffering precisely from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sape
"Put this worn-out surveillance on the trash."
“Are you going to wear these old socks tomorrow?”
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the ground."
If you do this digging work on your partner in this way several times a day, you will really break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think badly you want everything to be flawless.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much digging...
Defamation, persevering
Defamation, perseveration but also insults against someone are also the property of some women.
Women are particularly involved in relationships and thus are happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us lets escape a little harmless persiflation here and there.
The hand on the heart is a particularity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persever, even despise others and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially at work in a collective of women.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in the Philadelphia victory
Hockey striker Jagr has twice participated in the Philadelphia victory during Monday's NHL game over Caroline's ice and is once again in the lead of Czech players producing for the competition.
From the point of view of 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who still made one more pass and was named the best player in the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match told overseas journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
“I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick.”
"I heard it."
“Sometimes this feeling falls on you,” Jagr explained after his Giroux action marked a goal of the Flyers’ first shot.
A moment later there was a second attack by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goals for the palette and presented it to goaltender Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the top three," Jagr said of his center.
"I never thought I'd play in the end of my career with a hockey player like him."
“I’m really happy about that.”
“I want to play on him.”
"All these years in the NHL the other players on the team tried to play on me, now it's my turn," Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shootout she ends up with a difference from a goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended in two against one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He tapped on the pallet, I took the speed and [Read] went to the furthest corner of the cage.
“I tried to hit him and I got there,” Vorazek said, describing the final goal of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia came with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender from Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the match with Buffalo he came out in second place due to an injury in the upper body.
The Candians did not face an experienced defender their two-butset lead lost after a penalty shootout by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
This is the fact that the back line was sick which mainly bothered the local coach rather than lost points as they played the match only with 5 defenders.
"It's zero."
"We only played the game with an experienced player, the rest were young people."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," says Jacques Martin.
“Replacement on replacement was not enough and we couldn’t resist.”
“We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area.”
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, a Czech defender who took part in the 30th Winnipeg attack and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in the Jets' uax goals, which stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How Travel Prices Have Changed Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled for holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a westward inclination and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovakians) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
If the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example in Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter or the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered travel to the West however it was necessary to queue all night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The currency deal that was the condition for traveling west was rejected by “politically incorrect” people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the currency agreement (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and chalets that the Czechs were buying and this habit lasts until now.
The travels of the Czechs have been a great revolution since 1989.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were the maximum, the Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million days of vacation in countries around the world.
The big paradox that we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 90s of the last century in neighbouring Western countries caused a huge wave of short-term visits mainly to Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians could not for a long time travel by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations made the Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czech trip was at that time to take with you its own canned food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which finally allowed our tourists after decades of being able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage have increased, which has led to another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to a growing demand for travel, travel agencies have started since 1997 to prepare tours with air charter flights that through contracts have dramatically reduced costs compared to what existed before.
In the late 90s of the last century, the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world except the US which later facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year and every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to the far warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008 the EU removed visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully fit into the group of developed countries.
In 2008, for the first time in history, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time again in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for holidays abroad including the attached charges.
The General Assembly must find its President but this may end in a situation without a solution "a pat"
Almost 5 months already Czech football is without a President and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after yet another General Assembly is due to take place in Nymburk on Thursday.
However, there is still no agreement as to which voting rules should be adopted.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to come together and find a strong personality that will lead football into the future.
Only during the post-Hasek era did football return to divergences between the Association's chambers that could not agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16 when a new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because the negotiation remained blocked and there was not even a question of how to deal with the election.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the statutory representatives or also the full-fledged invested officials.
In this single point there has been partial agreement since that moment with the assistance also of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
The divergences continue with regard to the election regulation.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not contributed anything to the situation either.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times but the neuralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the trap.
"The apple of discord lies in the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, which represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the proposed model, in the third round, the candidate wins the one who has received the most percentage of votes in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw in order to win the candidate who has received the largest percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the vote percentages.
“Only then would it lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept,” admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian side and who says it would be best not to change the regulation and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even though he believes that the election regulation established according to the statutes has the most Pelta advantage among all candidates.
"I hope that we will be able to vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association."
"For there to be no sagrenu ideas yet imagined by a representative as during past General Assemblies," said Victoria Plzen's owner who is a candidate for the first time and who in her presentations has defined himself above all against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and he believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The qualification possible today in the European Championship should calm everyone down."
“Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation,” adds Jablonec’s officer, who among the three has the greatest experience in leading football both professionally and at the regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
“I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense.”
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the regulations to the drawing."
"This may again cause a blockage in the General Assembly."
"I hope that the sound reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some reunifications are expected to take place directly in Montenegro but who can say if the entire football direction will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight in which they were to travel to Podgorica, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the executive committee in the field of reprisals.
In the end, it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
Minister of Education for Youth and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the torn parts within the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to the fight for the position of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If Plzen’s head of football Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asked for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT) he would not be campaigning for this high office.
“If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him and I don’t stand for election.”
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech Press Agency (CTK).
Paclik’s motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try to stop Pelta from reaching the top of the AFRT, which would have been favored for this election.
Paclik also points out that in the event that he wins the elections he would hold this post of President only until 2013 year scheduled for a General Assembly.
He would see well in the function an experienced and high-level manager but who is not related to the world of football.
“I talked to people who would have the profile,” he said.
“For me it was terrible when some told me they didn’t want to be identified with Czech football at the moment.”
“I’d like to change that image,” he added.
What, it is said, bothers Paclik above all, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Plzen Regional Football Union Roman Berbr, a man of renown who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates of the General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable for Pelta to hold this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
“And with Berbr’s support, which is a high-flying trader, that would be even less favorable to football,” Paclik said.
What is still shocking is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago during hearings as part of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta escaped without any penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
“And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,” said Paclik, who said some time ago, “if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club to Plzen.”
In the event that Paclik triumphed in Thursday’s vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been backed by Paclik before the September General Assembly that had ended up with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with."
“He has great abilities.”
"He would be able to present himself for example as head of representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he wouldn't be able to."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," said Paclik, who in September drew great attention when he spoke for the cancellation of the Arbitrator Commission with Ludek Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to run private firms and that he also runs since last year the club of Plzen which celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
“I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it.”
"I would curb the influence of certain interested groups that have, for example, a tendency to influence the disciplinary and appeal commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," added Paclik, who does not seek his antipathy for Spartan leader Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonising relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose lobbying power with high-level policies would allow for more tax money on games for sport.
"This is one of the key points that the new President should address."
“If it’s about the gambling tax as stated by the political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money is going,” he said.
Paclik does not take his current relationship with Plzen's club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT President should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
“This is not the ideal.”
I don’t see any reason to pass on my Plzen club shares to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later,” Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT that should put an end to pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, the AFRT would have new statutes that would put an end to future disputes about the rules for elections.
Jablonec’s grievor is very optimistic ahead of Thursday’s meeting in Nymburk and believes that the success of today’s football performance should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta, prior to the September election that did not take place, promised to devote himself precisely to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly passed and this two-month delay could well allow him to defend his vision of football management and present it in a broad context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for Thursday there to be a president.”
“They feel it’s the best time for someone to take the direction of the Association,” he added, but he’s mostly linked to Jablonec’s club, worked a lot of years at Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
That’s also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election lies a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly the statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone noticed."
“If there weren’t all these different interpretations, we would have had a president since September,” Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that caught the attention of the delegates.
“If I become president, I take it as a personal mission and I am ready to take full responsibility in case it doesn’t work.”
“This is a principle without which we cannot exist,” Pelta added.
Then he tries, they say, not to confront his opponents.
He previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes had regard to his training in law and that he knows appropriately that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He has also not attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, which on the contrary does not stop criticizing Pelta.
“He’s been playing football for a year and has already had some success.”
"His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
“That’s also why some now have doubts about his character,” Pelta told his opponent but remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the competitions of the lowest level to the national representation.
It should be a football game.
“And I would also try to finish all the business that starts with that of the Bohemians or the aftermath of the corruption scandal.”
“I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we could get enough money for all of football,” the 46th candidate told the Czech press agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not lead to any change in people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he told Strahov where there is understandable nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for anything.
“If there is only one point of disagreement about how to vote in the third round, we’ll get over it.”
“Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there’s a new leader in its head,” Pelta says optimistically two days before the day is likely to be decisive for his grievor’s career.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT will begin to work hard
"If current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Czech Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday this would not please a large number of people," he said.
Rajchl, however, promises that in the event that he is elected, hard work will begin.
He wants systemic changes and makes the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by his predecessor Ivan Hasek.
“As president, I want to take care of football as a whole.”
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a high-performance football for youth."
"But I'm not saying I'm going to do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview with CTK.
"I'm a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a particular area."
“And I’m going to distribute difficult missions for football to take a big step forward.”
“A lot of people won’t be happy because it’s going to be starting to work hard rather than criticizing others,” he added.
He stated, it is said, that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know that I work 20 hours a day."
“But I need to know if it’s worth it and if I’ll have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and cast doubt on each of my actions,” he said.
“A lot of people told me anyway that I shouldn’t give up because they would give up too.”
“It’s a trust I can’t betray,” he says.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
“For the last two years there has been a lot of hard work and I don’t want to let it fall.”
“There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I wouldn’t want anyone to stop them,” he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will not return as it was before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic work and it’s something Mirek Pelta doesn’t know how to do.”
Behind him are people who would make football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been chosen.
“I can be blamed for a number of things, but I’m sure I can’t stand one.”
“I try to be objective.”
“I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only those who have been chosen.
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
“And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do my best for Moravia.”
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, whose winners would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation like currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
“I constantly feel the support of the Czech House that elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes,” said Rajchl, who is considering among his future successes to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiations on contracts and negotiations with the Czech Republic.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault for all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech footballer would lose his credibility", he thinks that second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
“No one can doubt Plzen has done a great job this year.”
"If elected, he would certainly continue in what has been started by Hasek and would not make any noticeable change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his successes," said Rajchl, who was evaluating his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
Julia Stanek
Ovni-optic hikers, Budapest’s beautiful swimming pools: Who travels across Europe can experience its blue miracle – and after turning the city or taking a long walk – can let his tired legs rest in gas baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip for the last 18 months, there is one object that should not be missing in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Spreading on her back in the water, she observes the domes artistically arranged, and swims against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If a covered swimming pool pleased her, she immediately noted in her booklet all the details worthy of interest about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the historian of architecture Meder and she presented them in her already published book: "Badefreuden (Bad Joys of Bath". The municipal indoor pools of Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the black forest, "Buildings of concrete in the Hardcore".
Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia, respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a real fan of bathing culture.
Meder explains that she doesn’t have much interest in the sport but he feels drawn to the water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that swimming fans should just look at blue tiles and settle for Javel’s water pointer, while joggers breathe from the scent of spruce forests or can hear from the park’s joyous bird flutter.
“I once wondered why the pools should actually always be so smooth,” the Viennese said.
"So I started a collection of beautiful bathrooms."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A dip in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - a factor of well-being in swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor one has a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on one side transparent, but reflects on the other side however the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicoloured tiles, springboards.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes a 190-page report worthy of interest on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly gives the desire to make a jump into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
Next to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cavern in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths whose pools are filled with water in terfl<0xC3><0xA1> and <0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xA1>sz in a jar containing terfl<0xC3><0xA1>.
On the other hand, the outdoor heated pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Z<0xC3><0xBC>rich bath one has the whole city in his eyes, one can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in L<0xC3><0xA4>ngenfeld: The Aqua Dome <0xC3><0x96>tztal looks like a UFO that has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the mountains of the <0xC3><0x96>tztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of Javel’s water does not come from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulfur, from <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be in a health spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor and outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricade.
The bath designed by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902 was temporarily closed.
By taking a look through the New Art-Building window in red-white-yellow, she observed the blooming of bad herbs between the tiles.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad Thermal Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements that come out since its design in 1844 but also a Moorish hall in the style of Alhambra that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite swimming pool of the swimming pool expert, Iris Meder - and not just because she is from Schwarzwald.
“It’s already a good performance to blend so different building styles into such a great unit,” says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural Speculation
The German bank examines in detail the speculation on raw materials
Christian Teevs
Is the German bank abandoning its speculation on raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to look into the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw consequences from it.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this business avenue because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the organization of consumers Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this article, author Harald Schumann points out that the stock market speculation on global raw materials pushes prices upwards and that banks share a complicity with global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign aligns itself concretely against the head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting in the same way.
Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect traders against price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the opinion that bettors have detached themselves from offers and demand – and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to criticism differently from U.S. competitors: He promised to investigate the allegations and said, "No matter is worth putting in the proper reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the Foodwatch-Report allegations.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Board of Directors of Deutsche Bank must be presented - usually with a recommendation.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the raw material market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode hailed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “The speculation about rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way, how much today’s banks are hurting the general interest.”
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, if it's about hungry people or if Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it’s clear that the CEO of the group wants to present a perfect picture, a few months before leaving his duties.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change anything to what is provided for in the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculations.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would cancel investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the survey on Tuesday, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Just 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank's clients would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such operations: one in two would terminate, as a result of the survey, all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculation.
43 per cent would disconsolate from such a bank around them, 49 per cent said they would consider canceling their account to change from a bank establishment.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that has moved
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
Now it is open again and holds place of exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about a modern post-war architecture, for its clear forms, its glass hangars, its bright and bold looks and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Brurexelles is an Austrian architect.
The Schwanzer Pavilion once received the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its steel and glass construction, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture to this day.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian Universal Exposition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exposed after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the southern station of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it was used for so long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and is becoming more and more difficult.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name "House of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvéd<0xC3><0xA8>re Museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a shot of luck from every point of view.
The new start was completed by Agn<0xC3><0xA8>s Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvéd<0xC3><0xA8>re.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among other things in her youth as an artistic skater, subsequently at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art of Salzburg, she has established the works of conservation and conservation in particular she has carried out the works of the works of conservation at the same time.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a cafe and a bookstore are located there, and an office must be built there.
Strict surveillance, small budget
Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter for the production.
Not only because he had sensibly transformed and expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht and that he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "virtually every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which he lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and by his change of use.
In today’s transformations, there were major problems: the “building was “an energy gust,” says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced with glass fibers was laid and the roof replaced with a special safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and the asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements made way for the new operation, a light panel silled between the house and the road ensures the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it's almost a new construction, but still the lightweight Schwanzer Pavilion.
The exterior doors of the origins have remained, the house is painted in a shade of protection against rust of red-brown color.
And the cinema room is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for the monuments and with a small budget.
“Often materials that are good and inexpensive had to be found, and which also like the office of protection monuments,” says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw soil in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained soft and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, “which came from Brussels,” Krischanitz said recently, a typical “Drop-in-the-City” story.
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and still wants to “awaken the right conscience”.
But in this case, the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands precisely the newly planned "Central Station Quarter", with offices and apartments.
And another chance will perhaps happen: the 21st-century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, she already negotiates with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Garden.
Bahn plans a planned winter crisis in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more in this regard this year.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung reported earlier by invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments totaling about 300 million euros would be expected by 2015.
This should allow better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snow-making of railway facilities and stations is expected to double to 16,000.
The goal is to get rid of snow and ice shelves until the start of the service phase and 90 per cent of the road equipment needed for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago the station chief R<0xC3><0xBC>diger Grube warned the government and the industry at a conference at the summit of train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of "users", because it lacks reserves, among other things, in case of difficult weather conditions.
This is why many new regional trains have been waiting for authorization from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has been doing something for years, as it has to have ICE train axles checked significantly more often at the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ICE at Cologne Central Station.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the case of chef Josef Ackermann there is something new in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a fine of millions.
As if the Deutsche Bank’s problems were not enough already, the past of this giant of the sector catches up with it in addition to the US: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison $145 million (106 million euros) to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is about the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator brings a whole series of accusations to the big banks, and that of having cooperative banks make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents have lost enormous value during the financial crisis and have led the banks downwards.
“We are pleased to have been able to find a solution to this issue without the parties initiating a court proceeding,” a Deutsche Bank spokesman said in New York.
The Bank did not admit any fault in comparison.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two banking institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and intervenes in case of bankruptcy, in order to protect client deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the damage caused by several billion dollars.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks apart and in the summer he assigned JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs to the Court.
With regard to the issue of mortgage documents it is about "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events already date back a few years, it is currently blowing a storm wind on U.S. banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have tried many remedies to obtain redress or to sanction breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It blames 18 major international banks, two U.S. state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for being in the nature of about $200 billion in mortgage deals.
The Deutsche Bank must also file an appeal with the FHFA, a number of operations with a total amount of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities request that the Frankfurter meet “substantial losses” but without citing an exact sum.
The Deutsche Bank has dismissed the claims as unjustified and says it wants to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett Raises $10 Billion at IBM
Buffett, the finance guru, invests colossal sums in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until then, the great American investor Warren Buffett constantly explains not to invest in IT companies, since the “long-term evolution of companies leaves only bad forecasts to appear.
However, he read IBM’s reports and changed his opinion on investments in this sector.
It had already been understood much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and IT systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight attack in the world of finance.
Therefore, the IBM IT activity is granted the right to call itself now "Mr. IBM".
Because Buffett revealed today to the CNBC economic show, which he has bought since March IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM has never been aware of this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, who even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable profits.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has for some time relied on the lucrative IT services as the "operation of accounting centers."
The pioneer of computing, more than 100 years old, offers both software and consulting as well as high-performance enterprise computers.
So far, Buffett has avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies that he understands business.
But on the contrary, Buffett is rather attacking the railway mill, manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
Its Berkshire Hathaway Holding has nearly 80 subsidiaries and shares with a number of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich R<0xC3><0xBC>ck.
This 81-year-old octogenarian had taken over the small Berkshire Hathaway textile company in the 1960s and had established it as one of the world’s most prestigious companies, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
This is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money earned him the nickname of "Omaha Oracle".
After the announcement of Buffett’s investment, IBM shares increased by one percent on the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", as it is also called IBM, has a total market value of more than $220 billion and has Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he doesn’t want to be involved.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubt the state of German law.
A newspaper even talks about a "bloody ideology" that would be reborn now.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extreme context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
For many German-Turkishs, the spectrum that was believed to have been dead for a long time has reappeared: since the M<0xC3><0xB6>lln bombings in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable with this far-right context against the Turks.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany, however, has never been questioned.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has been detected reveals proportions whose dimension is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology", "This was the title of the online publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, points out that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities might be involved in the far-right vortex.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted in a reasonable way: this weekend it called for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks before the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a 50th anniversary ceremony of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with gay colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of a gif: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Thus the German version of the "H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet" is not without its unique conditions.
"it begins to puer", is the title of Ahmet K<0xC3><0xBC>lahci's chronicle.
He points out that people would have been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was perceived in a very critical way on the German-Turkish forums and these had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why has it not come much earlier to the mind of the German authorities to do research in some suspicious extreme right-wing circles, the authors wonder.
More than one shows itself ready at least by rhetorical or even drastic means: “If the case continues to be stalled, there will be nothing left for migrants but self-defense and armaments.”
“It will be the best self-defense.”
“Internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network,” Selen writes.
What this means if domestic peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks on M<0xC3><0xB6>lln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained well.
The picture of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply embedded in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, what distrust and distance through acts of violence could lead to.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the sense of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past, it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks of which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of M<0xC3><0xB6>lln.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Head of State of Turkey, was represented at the funerals in Cologne by his Minister of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel at the time counted in his speech, how many taxes the Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the distrust of many Germano-Turkishs is towards the state of local law since that date.
In addition to the efforts to further clarify and reassess far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time around.
The scandalous bank of Lake Z<0xC3><0xBC>rich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost bankrupted in the financial crisis and in the meantime skates from one crisis to another.
He is a German who must lead now.
That’s certainly not what Axel Weber had in mind.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, we learned in July that in 2013 he would hold an almost as spectacular position: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber has publicly welcomed Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recent solidity and has made pleasant comments on future colleagues.
"UBS succeeds Turnaround".
"I am looking forward to collaborating with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel".
And yet, from September it was clear that everything was going to change.
A London-based UBS securities dealer had hijacked all of the Bank’s security systems and set fire to about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The President of the UBS Board of Directors has been seen as suffering - and everyone asks: When does Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised by the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the administration presidency as early as May - not in 2013, as the bank said Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adjustment.
Suddenly he takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of "Europe's largest scandalous bank".
Indeed, UBS is on the one hand huge – until recently, it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other hand, it has been skating for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, saves the so proud Swiss bank.
This started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also Russian, she had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from an easy customer base than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later professor of banking for many years in Zurich says: “I have always taken UBS as a model of good banking in front of my students.”
“From the current perspective, we ask ourselves: how could I have just been wrong at this point?”
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was not turning around at UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising way, which had until then been regarded as a great intellectual as well as a great banker.
A few months later we noticed why he was leaving.
The division of the bank had burned with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of CHF 13 billion and made a cross on it.
For this, she actually found investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which had gone silent, to the point that her name had never even been learned.
But that was only the first time.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to announce again losses of billions, and the chairman of the board Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second highest-paid board in Switzerland, withdrew.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS was, given its investment mistakes, in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank has purchased tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for convertible bonds into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken – because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the total of the balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
“We couldn’t save UBS again,” says bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, it was followed by the second.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy customer, who had perhaps cheated the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in reimbursement of unjustified profits from these operations with an increased fine.
Thus, the UBS has more or less published that it has helped with tax fraud.
At the same time, she has lost something that has always been her capital in competition with rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
This was followed by the removal of the Chief of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus, in a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: banking investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to aid to tax fraud.
And, as there was a bit of a return to calm, and as it was thought, that the UBS would come out of it, it followed this unfortunate story of title traders: a single title trader flaunts 1.7 billion euros, before the bank noticed that something was not turning.
And we publish: with the risk management in an investment bank this still does not seem to work.
“With the Adoboli case, it has been found that risk management has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute at the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also certain: “The problem with UBS is that it has no control over the risks.”
However, it was exactly the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long assumed their function, that of becoming custodians of the great wealth of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of unshakeable reliability as Lindt and Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the solid cliché of the private Swiss bank - it's just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank is headquartered at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the central station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, the store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers like Tiffany's can be found here in the shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli confectionery.
For centuries, Swiss bankers have lived here: from the national bank to the Swiss Credit Palace to elite private banks like Julius B<0xC3><0xA4>r.
We arrive at the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered in marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other away from the market – or betrayed the two great Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Switzerland, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, eventually like all Swiss bankers he does business with the two big banks as well.
The UBS would have become much too large, he finds - especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons would have also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to the morals of the Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the jungle of sub-prime as the great Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday, the small-town government coalition of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in their nation's history," author Lukas H<0xC3><0xA4>ssig wrote in his book "The crash of the UBS."
With up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three major Swiss banks concluded a huge group together.
A bank was created, which was already too big for small Switzerland – and has continuously recorded an increase.
What helped was that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as strong a point the asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly already more strongly internationalized.
All of a sudden, the international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, former Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who is very good at modeling and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has paved the way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted himself to the end in Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: “He thought his models were reality,” Geiger says.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: exuberance came before the fall.
UBS staff clearly remember the meetings of the leaders during which the head of the Wuffli group always spoke the same word: to dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" the rankings, which documented the success of the banks at that time.
After all the UBS wanted to go all the way up.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In the case of currencies and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
However, the corporate advisors, who were responsible for this, pointed out a weakness: in international interest operations, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference from the larger banks.
UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost him his life.
Aspired by growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It has turned into a massive machine that has packaged and passed securities based on U.S. mortgages – but which has also kept risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to come down.
“Even in the summer of 2007, while the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” says banking expert Geiger.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts turned out to be more difficult than one thought.
Posts at UBS have become executable and have so far been bankable.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
It must find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration on property management, back to the Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn’t want to go that far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as far as this is clear so far.
Next Thursday, the head of the bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be on a temporary basis when the bank split with surprise from its predecessor Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel.
In the meantime, he has imposed himself: he must conduct UBS business sustainably, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to a state of progress in the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to earn money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly asked himself.
He says publicly so far only that he was going to pick up an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market

As announced by the Eurostat statistics office, companies produced in September, 2% less than in the previous month.
U.S. investors expressed themselves in a skeptical way: “We’re not an island, on the other hand, dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman’s management.
Europe will soon not be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, only confirmed this caution: “It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis,” he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was too early in its view to invest in bonds from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle into the wind and entered the U.S. technology industry.

Smart cornices are spreading in cities
In many places, ferrets are considered a "bird problem" but experts say these highly intelligent animals have not been allowed to hunt cities for a long time.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Corneliles have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplied because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote to the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
During the first ostfriesisch symposium on cornices, experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt the freckles of cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Nature's protectors also based the problems of cities on the exodus of particularly protected straws: The use of chemicals in agriculture is destroying more and more traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, setting up, and slaughtering typical oak trees made life difficult for birds.
Corneals are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in the Westf<0xC3><0xA4>lischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity due to the corneal massacre in the region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal gourdins.
“Normal eviction, eviction, is of no use,” said Werner Kl<0xC3><0xB6>ver, the city and landscape planner for Leer.
The destruction of nests using pressurized water or cutting down trees often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
"Animals move away, large colonies divide, and they disperse to other places."
The eviction is imaginable only in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We are forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Concevable is a combination of animal hatching with aversive conditioning and hanging offers, in order to allow them to resettle elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens envisioned “information panels instead of clippers” in order to establish completely different relationships with them: “We can finally better bear a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence.”
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens co-founded the Ascheberger-road-educational of the corbels at Schleswig-Holstein, road signs reporting on the life of these very intelligent brakes.
This project was adopted by tourists in the meantime.
J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by the birds: "There's a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: the ferrets not only use working instruments to arrive at a reward, but they themselves manufacture their tools as working instruments.
University of Cambridge ethologists have been testing four birds recently, to what extent the intelligence of birds is arriving.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to cause a scaffolding to collapse with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they definitely recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to cause the platform to collapse.
In a second test, the clever corneals then had to solve a more complicated problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their butin with their beak.
However, the researchers had put pieces of iron wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four mills were successful from the very beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks suddenly remained unsuccessful.
The favorites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the European Championship 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the latest tickets in the knockout rounds at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and suddenly eliminated Ukraine.
Driven by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal drove against Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after the 0:0 of the match, his fifth participation in the European championship.
The Czechs reached the game back-to-back by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first half (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was also more burning in the 0-0 match between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) release against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11-metre penalty hand (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) made a two-time cut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a 30 metre free kick ahead of the grid.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his shooting qualities at a distance and shot at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to striker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship in Manchester City has started a head ball directed down the cross-bar, the ball has not crossed the finish line (33rd).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally, the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding at the center of all the attentions.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card in Portuguese (36th).
On the other side, Stark awarded an 11-meter penalty played by the controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But after the break, the vice-champion of Europe in 2004 managed four hits and everything became clear.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubt in the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), also had luck and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last-minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored at the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the rescue of the already shot world-class Czech goalkeeper, once again, the striker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb during this time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb were unable to get past 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the bench of the third of the 2002 European Championship, the Croats were able to enjoy their fourth round in the final of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund at 62 e Minute, the legionnaires of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the field.

Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed at top speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Los Angeles Galaxy’s Robbie Keane got the first good chance.
Only at the last moment that the defense of Estonia was able to prevent a possible goal of the -first striker.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After a failed defense from goaltender Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and would tighten the ball to the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Until 2015, about two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,” CEO Bill McDermott told his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP’s 176,000 global customers are located in this expanding country.
Growth plans in China are also an important part of Dax Group’s 2015 Strategy.
SAP plans to increase revenue by 2015 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion.
Last year, the Walldorfer recorded a revenue of nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12.5 billion.
Currently, the business management of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked as well.
SAP has been active in China for over 20 years.
“Now, we want to expand our activities (...),” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information.”
The Killing of Personal Mass
Titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (Beauty and Grief: an Intimate History of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that closes your heart.
A tip to get started: tear this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
In this Peter Englund novel, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mists of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize in Literature.
Here he wrote an unusual book that he describes, with accuracy, as "a work of anti-history."
It has a few well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion of strategies and materials.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it might look like." We find the "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and Grief" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, from both sides of the war, from young schoolchildren and botanists to climbers, through doctors, ambulances and vendors.
Some of them will become heroes.
Some of the prisoners of war will lose their members, become mad, or lose their lives.
Their lives here fluctuate like the candles of a church: while some are extinguished, new ones are re-enlightened.
Peter Englund's book differs from traditional history books.
It brings a denial to the idea that the First World War is only summed up by the terrible war of trenches on the Western front.
"Beauty and Grief" skillfully describes other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsé-tsé flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people, such a natural disaster, such as Hurricane Katrina, which sets the tone.
When cannon strikes resound in the distance, and you are a mother at home, do you stay or run away?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, not even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been exacerbated by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor from the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly taken from previously published memoirs, letters, and other documents.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most deal with deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from cooked rice crushed in sheep's fat (and finished with a fake wood bone); tobacco made with dried roots and ground apple-dried skin; soles of wooden shoes."
He states that "837 authorised substitute meats are recorded in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories deal with honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive towards the wilderness and declares about the war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were meant to do, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, reading a newspaper and a bestseller.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at high risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
“When one is resigned to sacrificing oneself, one hopes to have an audience,” he writes.
It is, unfortunately, quite similar to "a man convicted in secret".
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
“The conflict is becoming more and more a story of economic competition,” writes Peter Englund, “a war between factories.”
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the early century's livestock: the well articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who runs his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act in unexpected ways; there are as many basic behaviors as there are heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease among prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
“We find the most grotesque expression in the pus trade due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread on the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital,” he writes.
“The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into a lifetime of blindness.”
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Peter Englund’s prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures the way war has "triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making them war.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as Paul Fussel's "Great War and Modern Memory", or Erich Maria Remarque's "To the West nothing new", rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he's come out of his book, grab this page with your hands and burn it with a lightbulb.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers have been involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret to all but a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the beginning that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, who went against the department’s settlement and generated a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clean Zuccotti Park from its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island, for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against the riots – anti-terrorist measures that involve quickly moving a large number of police officers – to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place on Monday evening, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move into the park arrived "at the last minute," said one resident, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise".
"The few policemen I know who were called didn't know they were going to Zuccotti Park," the person said in a statement.
"The only ones who know they'd go there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city has learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean up the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters who were informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from across the neighborhood - from dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going and coming to the park during the day, like migrants, so an hour in the morning was a good time.
“It should be done when the park had the least number of people,” he said.
Emergency vehicles equipped with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages resonating with loudspeakers seemed to intimidate protesters.
As community business officers entered the park equipped with their light blue windshields, many protesters simply gathered their businesses and left.
No tent was touched until 1:45 p.m., police said, leaving time for occupants to gather their belongings.
Other police teams have been spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests are needed.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the police department, said the measure had only been taken for safety reasons.
But, according to many journalists, the police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, which was rudely held by officers.
Browne said the television cameras on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved west through the thick business of the protesters, including luggage, plastic lawn and leaf bags filled with clothes, teams from the sanitation department were following, cleaning up everything that the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged away. The images were posted on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to stop methodically.
About ten people at the epicenter of the camp hung together.
Finally, two people chained to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services have been called to cut off the locks.
No arrests took place in the park before 3:30 a.m., Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Mostly for "problem in public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most qualified officer to be found on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, though present, "did not conduct operations," Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a patch of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, south.
Police have been seen expanding the perimeter far beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away from them.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place south of the park.
About 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car and others were spotted digging up the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood emerged from the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a protester were hospitalized.
The school aid union continues the city for layoffs
The union, which represents hundreds of schools that lost their jobs last month, plans to try a trial in the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory layoffs. The impact is disproportionate to schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
Prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, the 37th District Council, to try to cancel the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aid workers, parents coordinators and other employees, who were among the least paid in the city, lost their jobs on October 7, and the union leaders compared these dismissals to political revenge for not letting the city access to a health care fund run by working groups.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this accusation.
At a municipal council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the closed budget in June.
A member of the Council responded, noting that the discharges of school aid were not in any way specified in the budget.
37th District Council officers said they would file a complaint notice, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecutions at the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's education department will be the defending party. Complainants will be represented by eight licensed workers, all of black or of Latin American origin, like most school aid workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city’s legal department, said the municipality had not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and was therefore unable to comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of layoffs in schools in the city’s most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to a sub-finishment.
While there are no redundancies on Staten Island, and just a few in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa facilities, 17 school aid workers lost their jobs in Brownsville's 23rd District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school workers at Harlem Public School 36, where 68 percent of schoolchildren live in poverty, the lawsuit states that "It's not a neighborhood of easy parents who can bring in funds to fill the budget deficit."
The budget of Public School 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year, and funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each enrollment of disadvantaged students.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators.
The memo used the term "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "Sixty-six parental coordinators have been fired", and "not just for reasons of excess".
Completed mission: Congress finds agreement on the issue of Libya
It would finally appear that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement in the Chapter on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It would have taken a successful uprising, the capture and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, backed by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding their American people for their Libyan people.
“This resolution is about honoring the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"This is bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not the military role of the United States in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution to authorize the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure aimed at reducing funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission has thus remained in the form of a legislative purgatory – Congress opposed enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The Congress’s indecision has been overcome by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgency in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
NATO’s mission officially ended on October 31st.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee’s resolution “congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom” and “congratulates the men and women of the U.S. armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their professionalism and professionalism.”
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States to achieve an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers as it did last June?
Senator and Commission President Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said on Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House is due to vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget, or any other issue, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to pass their amendments, but it is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been tabled in Congress, on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others are slight variations from a previous one.
There are at least 15 versions in the House of only the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would "control federal spending".
Some of these bills are identical, but they give their supporters - especially the new Republicans who want to give their CVs gold - the chance to boast of being the "author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act passed last August called for the vote of the House and Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wish to limit the number of terms in which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wishes to raise the limit of two terms for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) has proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the flag’s profanation.
Some lawmakers also want to authorize the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states oppose it.
As eager as the members have been to offer amendments, they are not as quick as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The rate slowed compared to the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, based on figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments did not have much more success than they do today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
'Massacreed but not beaten' Gabrielle Giffords says in her first televised interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot him in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on a television show on Monday night, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said she wanted to re-establish herself instead.
When she appeared on ABC's "20/20", alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show approached its difficult return following the bullet that fractured its skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing its head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first televised interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang – and described her recovery as “difficult”.
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, responded "rather well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a one-hour special edition of "20/20", broadcast the day before the release of the couple's new book titled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special show has traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, shaved head and a broad scar on the forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with her husband’s encouragement.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair as doctors teach her how to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in Gabrielle Giffords' recovery: one sees the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin"?
In an interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours a day with the doctors, said she does not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for information on the six people killed in the incident for the first time.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is held in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
“There have been many deaths,” Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Wait, wait, wait."
On her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, "I was beaten."
"Then I would say, 'Gabby, you weren't beaten,'" said Mark Kelly.
You've just been massacred.
And you're going to get out of it, recover, and come back even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless New York City veterans.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in tie-up stood at his feet to cheer him up.
“Military men and women are considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military presence at the gala, which was also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, saw the roles of the troops differently.
“They were presented as a kind of orphan,” the military senior wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have settled between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, some soldiers say.
The public is acting more and more as if they are sorry for men and women in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky minds."
This is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not want to appear unrecognizable or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the returning troops of the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most of the conversations about mercy take place in complete secrecy among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from combat with the Marines, retired colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect as they were confronted by insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if “an angry and violent veteran hides under the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work at the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who were passing him the interviews were asking in a subtle way whether he would be able to hold the blow under the stress of a job demanding in Washington immediately after his return from combat.
“When you approach the subject of the service, you are faced with negative impressions,” recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely congratulated by a country so little familiar with the military and which sees little direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way we did in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of the politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a military.
Troops are recognized for the number of service periods, the number of lost friends, or the extent of injuries.
The Army Faces Growing Pressure to Seize Against Rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged rape inaction.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008 and she was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked if he could join her in his room to have a drink.
“It was an alarm signal,” said Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texan has put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
“He’s from Texas,” she says.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after he entered Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her behind, dumped and raped, she claims.
This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and others not, will eagerly await the court decision during a historic trial that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and which will decide whether a trial brought against former Secretary of Defense Donald Rudes and his predecessor, Robert Gates.
They are accused of failing to stop the widespread use of rape in the army, thus opposing the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number rose to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claimed that the army did not provide them with the necessary supplies.
Susan Burke says she takes it to the gallant military, because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are the individuals in the position of "eradicating the culture of reprisals? The leaders."
The lawyer also states that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future prosecutions.
Her strategy: instead of bringing together all the complainants in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will take several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active duty personnel.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants," the documents indicate.
The Department of Defense has refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to war, this distinction is only written on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women’s troop teams are playing an increasingly important role, particularly in getting in touch with local women.
Out of these two wars, 150 female soldiers lost their lives - two-thirds in combat.
It is time for the army to modernize itself, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnoses of "personality problems" attributed to the victims of rape in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru's Women's Service's Network for Women's Rights.
His group filed a lawsuit with the Veterans Administration in December, accusing them of discriminatory practices in how to deal with requests for benefits for people claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were submitted to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, offering a variety of solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Department of Defense’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAO).
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is under-estimated; indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The March report also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the army were prosecuted - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
Complainants of Susan Burke's case describe their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informs the military police of the rape less than an hour after the facts.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape of various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is seated before a judge, at a trial in which she is questioned about her sexual relationship with her boyfriend earlier in the day of her assault.
Six people testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator of the crime, who ended up being acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was handed down,” says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start getting contractions, and I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commander, 'It wasn't his trial, it was mine.'"
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosing a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was returned under less than honorable terms, preventing it from receiving any benefit.
Whether the Lyman case and the other plaintiffs will move forward or not is a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington Law School.
However, he points out, “In my opinion, they should be able to move forward.”
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is found between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and means of deterrence posed by responsibility.
“The odds are heavy against them... but it’s important that they try,” he added.
These things only change when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial is not in their favor, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for other trials.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue as long as there is no reform,” she said.
Until we die, one or the other of the two options.
Walls Have Eyes: Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far-right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy who shared his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been caught in a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was faced with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time prior to the attack on his computer, discussing with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Connect to Facebook.
“We realized that it wasn’t so difficult to find them,” said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published by DEMOS’ think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they’re looking for with scientific precision — the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett’s team found that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to an investigation. The questions asked were about their level of rape and the level of rape they had.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without leaving the office.
“It’s a new way to do research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young people and anti-immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen.”
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Thinking groups, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "I like", wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the “supernova of data” is generating an explosion in research, increasing the number of research jobs whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you might not be able to approach on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to investigate the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You should go to the party, but they would never have allowed you in,” says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their feats in a state of ebrition were vastly more likely to be alcoholic than discreet students.
Megan Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would talk about alcohol too often.
“You can’t treat a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle.
“We know how to identify children at risk, and who would not otherwise be recognized.”
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site's data-driven team studied statistics on the love situation and Valentine's Day, the participation rate in the midterm elections of 2010 and a national happiness index (thanks to the information only available - the champions of digital freedom have long supported the site's availability to others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven’t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to gather information other than via the Internet, it is anything else online.
“I don’t think a large number of users have ever thought that a researcher can study their profile,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user’s wall.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things,” says Neil Selwyn.
That’s why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notebook and pen remain the best tools one can use.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he said.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social, it's not in front of a computer."
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik's first appearance
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance” fighter during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Templars of Norway,” he told a hearing room filled with 500 people.
“As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I refuse it because you hold your mandate of organizations that support an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I recognize the facts but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to leave him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought a paper speech with him, speak to the victims’ parents at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for an additional 12 weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that he would be placed behind bars.
Everyone took part in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
“I found it cold and inhuman,” a Utoya survivor told Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally advanced a bit after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes as he walked in and out of the courtroom.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy, and also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of 22 July seem therefore to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may be comforting to some.
But this does not reduce the sadness or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but that's not the case," a victim's parent said.
“It would have been a lot easier.”
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview at Cinema This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans may find more revealing in a recent Steve Jobs interview that will air this week in the first part of a film on major markets, is how much this creative spirit had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was no doubt a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organigram enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease letting them think that a great idea of labor is a great idea."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds", which traces the birth of the computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years since Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs’ death that a complete video was found in the director’s garage.
This video, slightly upped, is the basis of the 68-minute film titled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released in theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems to be surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs’ perfectionism resurfaces, where he seems eager to hear Cringely’s questions, giving him elbows to speed it up and move on to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he sees as good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then implements them right away.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a company:
“During all these years, I’ve always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers are constantly the same: ‘Oh, just because you have to do them.’”
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues to provide details of his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how the costs were recorded - one often starts with a "standard cost" evaluated for the nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that guaranteed accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack telephone networks and call for free on long distance.
The device has been the subject of many writing before, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public telephone, passing a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
“We enveloped the ball of different things a half-dozen times and you were screaming in the public phone and it happened to you a minute later on the public phone next door,” Jobs explains, laughing.
“We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We didn’t know much about both, but we were able to invent a little thing that could control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak have developed: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night, passing on to Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go out laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love of technology (and the departure of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and gives him a hint.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP’s employees to visit the company’s research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the “first desktop ever designed.”
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a little cathode tube, and I fell in love with him.
The teenager I was at was back at HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products at a head start.
At the beginning of his career, as he settles down to sell some printed circuit boards, a client asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, he had to deal with assembly as well as delivery of finished appliances.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered to develop a computer mouse:
"I remember a lot of big fights... I was yelling at myself saying it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Eighty-ten days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that would be incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that blow up:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industrial leaders would go wrong and lose control of their market share.
“Let’s say you work at IBM or Xerox, do you make a better copywriter or a better printer, and then?”
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [these are the types of people] who end up running businesses and product-focused staff are put off making decisions.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can’t imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product – the manual work required.
This is what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
She could have done ten times her current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
“A huge part of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to be made... Some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories can too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by putting them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product that you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal great ideas.
The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn’t for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dine with health law opponents as the court meets
On the day the Supreme Court meets in private to discuss the issue of political disagreement, namely whether the opposition to President Obama’s health law will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm’s co-defendant.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases involved a trial by 26 States challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that was a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental 5:30 a.m. argument is expected in March, and the result will likely be to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is made.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue over the rejection of the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as a U.S. solicitor general during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clément’s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen law firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another proponent was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial challenge in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
There was, among other things, Mitch McConnell, top Republican in the Senate and declared opponent of the health law.
The guests are having dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend fundraisers of law-related organizations and others although the judge may not be an interlocutor, guest of honor, or featured on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of government ethics.
"This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court complies with the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges were drinking and dining and collecting gala funds with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event disproves any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for critics saying they too easily mix court cases with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
In addition, conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general solicitor for the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law was brought to the court of first instance.
Her critics pressed for Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records a record order of $18 billion for airliners
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, bi-pilot airliners, with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order contemplating 50 of its products.
It is, on the other hand, a whole affair when the company in question is the Boeing aircraft manufacturer and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record amount of $18 billion.
Equally amazing is who Boeing received this order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that Middle East airlines will need in the next 20 years 2,520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing informed of the order of the most expensive commercial aircraft in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-seaters.
It is the Dubai-based Emirates airline that has placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said on Monday that Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, dubbed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and conveniences for passengers.
The amount of these six devices is more than a billion dollars.
“It’s clearly very positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries have many of their airlines.
They therefore not only have the means to pay for these aircraft, but an increase in the price of fuel - usually harmful to airlines because it represents their most significant costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or delay their aircraft orders as the price of oil increases, Dihora said.
“They have natural risk coverage,” he said.
The Emirates command reinforces Boeing’s dominance in the market for large-carrier aircraft and helps to curb the attempt to impeach the competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the aeronautical show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the start of the larger version of the A350, which rivals directly the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is pushing ahead to increase its momentum as a result of its customers’ demand to increase its charging capacity and autonomy.
Boeing’s shares rose 1.5 percent to reach $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican president clearly beaten in the elections of the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
Luisa Maria Calderon says drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent Fausto Vallejo in the race for governor.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister seems to have lost her attempt to access the office of governor of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n during violent elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the head of the race for the governorship of this western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon told radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election officials... they took the ballots, installed roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo does not seem to have noticed much of Calderon, who was in charge of the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother’s conservative party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, leftist candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently serves as governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unfortunate left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the first results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any links with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the "state of origin" of President Calderon, and he chose Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
But the violence persisted.
A week before the election, a PAN mayor was assassinated while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates locally resigned from the campaign out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n elections look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging for next year."
BASD strongly encourages Asia to come to aid in the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the chief executive officer of the Manila-based BASD, said the world’s two fastest-growing economic powers needed to “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and reported that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would avoid a long-term collapse of the world economy.
“We are all in this crisis together.”
“Therefore anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
“Asia can be protected to a certain extent but it is not protected.”
"So if China and India can help, then nothing will stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan was dangerously high and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece resigned.
The booming sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that the world economy will go into recession, and has prompted calls for major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Nag predicted that the IMF would provide any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance – such as buying the U.S. financial rescue fund’s obligations, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater negotiating power to Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s Minister of Trade and Industry, said that “India will do everything it can” to help the euro area as its own economy is now suffering from a fall in exports and a tarnishing of foreign capital arrivals.
“Nobody wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges to face and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a choice, it’s an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans as they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to make Europe accept aid to 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live on $2 a day, or even less.
“One day, they will discover that the Greeks are retiring at age 50 and that they are going on holidays in the sun and they will have trouble getting over it,” he said.
Lee Howell, president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Nag said the eurozone crisis was likely to cause “significant repercussions” across Asia.
BASD's forecasts of economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now face "loss risks" due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "draw up emergency plans" to protect themselves from economic reversals and major capital outflows.
The Pentagon's Serious Warnings on Potential Defense Reductions
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields of the Afghan civil war.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but is now afraid that an additional $600 or more of the cuts will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impact of these reductions would be devastating for the department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting from the so-called sequestration would result in 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
“Such a significant reduction, applied without discretion, would make most of our ships and our construction projects unenforceable — you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or building — and seriously undermine other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a certain number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on leave without pay in order to achieve the goal."
“These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and would seriously damage our preparation.”
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
“Although the wartime financing of the accounts of foreign contingent operations is not directly affected by the sequestration, the war effort would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in the core budgets,” Panetta warned.
"Contracting personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and the supervision of contracts that support the war."
“The salary management staff would be reduced, resulting in payment delays to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power."
“We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon during the publication of Panetta’s letter.
“It’s not a consequence that we can live with, and it’s certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves.”
“Sequestration is a threat to U.S. national security interests, and it shouldn’t have to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent senators’ warnings increase the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible compressions, even though he himself has reached the Pentagon’s highest position, gaining years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what could happen - a military with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings, and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission," Panetta said during his preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
“It’s a depressed, ill-prepared force and unable to cope with potential opponents.”
"Actually, she invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how new reductions could "generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable future risk of unacceptable warfare."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could go to the cut, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new off-road vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Ending development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Find a Lie
A look at recent headlines shows how much deception and lie are omnipresent in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner has gone on to become an idiot by quickly emitting denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to the coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, none of those who have lived history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating on the tests of the school and the university are legion.
There have been cases where teachers gave the test responses to students in order to get a good look at their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to write: "I've had you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in deep-rooted psychology and research in prestigious universities.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been demystified.
The liars look you in the eye.
They don’t get wet, reddish or don’t always get agitated.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, question formation, and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include, amongst other things, the mismanagement of the
Good liars are able to read others well, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "centred on them" while women say more lies "centred on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie to their partners less often than non-married people lie to them than they do to their partners.
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is what is called "setting the reference data".
This helps to provide a reference point for measuring subsequent changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, laughter, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally moves his feet constantly so as not to throw unfair accusations when you see him move his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of verbal and non-verbal misleading behaviors.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Cheating people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change posture significantly, or present a "post-interview" relief - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all issues are not difficult.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is completed just to seek to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson snagged using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Fraudulent individuals may also use a distant language: "I have not had sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or completely repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember goods... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be disrupted after the threat of late U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico — fuelling the unions’ anger while calming environmentalists — the company looking to build the pipeline says it is ready to reroute the pipeline to the project.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that it will move the projected pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually get the approval of an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives new studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogalla aquifer.
“It’s a real way forward,” Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department is likely to have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the policy's involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s decision, and expressed his support.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries.
To do this, he would have to go through six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed this plan are pushing for a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said that the department's inspector general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focused on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a Hillary Clinton campaign advisor in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that the Disco Patti LaBelle diva, launched in a riot of violence in the hall of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she threw fear into it.
The shooting of the singer "Lady Marmalade" frightened 18-month-old Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve Monk to such an extent that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers", her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was on November 10 last year as stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve were preparing to leave on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk was going to look for the car, Roseanna Monk went down into the hall of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she had stopped near the door and posed her daughter for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and I went to get her," she said.
LaBelle angrily warned the pregnant woman.
“She told me in an aggressive tone: ‘You shouldn’t leave your daughter near the door,’” said Roseanna Monk.
“I said, ‘What you say or think doesn’t interest me.’
She became angry and began to use oaths - the word "" and the word "" with a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and started to spill water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve became hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” the child’s mother said.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who was still holding Genevi<0xC3><0xA8>ve in her arms - and had to be restrained by her entourage who drove her towards a car that was waiting for them, Roseanna Monk says.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started to vomit, she added.
Later, the family sent an apology note to LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not return our calls for comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a charity against cancer for children.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct,” Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has slowed down the economy
During Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez’s first year of management, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality increased, foreign investment decreased and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, self-called change, which has generated great expectations in terms of the progress of the economy, but given the economic development of the beginning of the year, the economic development of the new year has increased.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing trillions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the other economic decline of 31 per cent,16
According to the report of allocations by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there have been damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent have suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 per cent have suffered partial damage and the main crops have been damaged.
The decline in economic activity has led to a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, to a decrease in the number of unemployed in the first three quarters of the year, to a decrease in the number of unemployed, to a constant increase in the number of unemployed in the state, to a decrease in the number of unemployed, to a decrease in the number of unemployed in the first three quarters of the year, to a decrease in the number of unemployed, to a decrease in the number of 6, and a decrease in the number of unemployed in the number in the population, and in the number of 5, and in the number of unemployed in the number of
Less liquidity.
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly based on actions carried out by public policy.
"What is observed is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who earn dollars in a way that is not illegal, they say what they are doing is useful for people who are making money.
Detained Migration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes reported that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad, in the United States has been limited, firstly because of entry difficulties and secondly because by entering they already have a lot of difficulty finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Lack of Seriousness
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloen is aggravated by the high level of lack of seriousness that prevails between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the shift to the state is low wages, the entity has the lowest salaries in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecasting.
The average monthly income of the workers in Sinaloa was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 the highest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June, the State FDI reported $630 thousand 697, which represents a decrease of $14 million in the same year, down from $14 million in the previous year.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
Let this
In the light of the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State did not request in July the approval of a loan of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy and the approval of the
Reactions
For employers, Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés' first year of Government demonstrates a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have had to align the effort of all and especially the good work already synchronized by this new team of government," he said.
Economic Lenses
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said that events such as the beginning of the year’s frosts retained the state’s economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced by several events, among which the frosts, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate economic dynamism that allows for an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations," he said.
Redefining the vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said the state was being channelled into more dynamic productive activities.
“In general terms, we have observed that work has been done, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that we detonate the full potential of Sinaloa’s material and human resources,” he said.
Much to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channelled the Government's efforts.
“In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term program,” he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in how public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that a lot of work has been done and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do," he said.
Sentenced to 8 kilos of marijuana
One person living in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fines for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic reported that the convicted petty trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in his variant of marijuana possession for sale.
In accordance with AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was riding in a pickup truck, white, in which he was carrying a black bag in the vehicle's trunk and in the place of the copilot a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items were made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Enforcement Centre for Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debts to contributions to the works
Social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Espacios P<0xC3><0xBA>blicos and 3x1 for migrants may not be finished where to record serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda reported.
The Director of Municipal Social Development said that although construction programmes have so far progressed, they are in a risk situation, as the State Government has failed to meet its obligations to provide contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He noted that in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is a possibility of a delay in their completion.
“They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end they gave us nothing, even if since July they had to give us a part of it,” he said, “and we, in order not to record any delays, we started the books and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money.”
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the municipality had to apply for a loan to cover the 7 million that the state administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to operate and this year, in order to have access to these programs, we have managed to get the resources to cover what the state had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the state authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the operations so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
“They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end soon, they haven’t given us anything.”
The Court validates the “analog cut” in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has sparked constitutional disputes that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog coup" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to invalidate it have not been met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic has been brought to light for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drafted by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, due to the fact that the regulation on radio and television is an assignment reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), contrary to the principles of reservation of subordination.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero themselves voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions provided by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of ministers also decided to open up the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project of which Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I also do not consider that if it did, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate of the head of state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this translates into better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitization which involves a decision of public interest that not only has a technical dimension, "because this also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he stressed, "requiring the operation of an established system, in accordance with the principle of economic management of the State, include a group of powers that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the State Executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries from all over the world have already completed the digital transition and have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has in some form invaded the sphere of competence of the Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws issued by the Legislative, he assures.
We analyze the possibility of a "vote-by-vote" discount in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor’s election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,744 total minutes.
The possibility of the "vote-by-vote" count is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and the second place of the election of the governor is only 27 per cent.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with federal reform in the field.
It will be remembered that Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n did not approve either his Political Constitution or his State Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Act, at the same time as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline for this Electoral Trial to enter into force by the Government of the Republic of Spain.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislative power and called the vote of the state’s representative for constitutional reforms “invalid and illegal” because he has no right to “sanctify” them.
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counting of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there are no minutes of voting and the count in the record of the ballot is not found in the president of the ballot box; or there are
In addition, the total count of votes received in all ballots in the second election may be achieved when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winning the respective election and the candidate who obtained the second place in the election is equal to or below a percentage point of representation of the candidate and that there is an indication that the percentage of the candidate's vote is equal to or below the percentage point of the candidate's vote;
The total count of the vote may also be taken if, at the end of the common count, it follows that the difference between the alleged candidate winning and that of the second place is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express petition of the representative of the political party from which the candidate has left the second, in which case the candidate will be excluded
It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16%, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
Its ashes will be spread in the Zapalinamé mountain range, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a requiem mass.
According to his family, the last will of the Lieutenant-Colonel was for his ashes to be spread in the Sierra de Zapalinamé.
After receiving tributes from other people dying in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on the side of a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the Lieutenant-Colonel arrived at the watchtower of Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where the family and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes to the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former colleagues of a technological bachelor’s degree and the American football team that Felipe Bacio was part of when he was preparing for the bachelor’s degree.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and have his ashes spread in the Zapalinamé mountain range, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the driver's sister.
For her, the Lieutenant-Colonel had fulfilled all her dreams, she considered that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and cared for his family a lot".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo at a very young age to register with the College of Air in Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it, because they said he was even in a truck accident; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n for his parent’s graduation, so he knows that his uncle is dying doing what he loved most in life: flying an airplane.
His last goodbye
In 1985, the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was honored to have led the governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Army, the Army of Mexico, and the Army of Mexico.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, alongside the Secretary of Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all officials of the service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Christine.
Three abandoned bodies, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with the stroke of grace, in an abandoned property in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The discovery took place on the 1.5 kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed through this place noticed that in the property, whose fence has the beige color and coffee the gate was wide open.
Looking inside, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
One meter away there was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were on the stomach.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another location, as no in situ douches were found.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by a group of organized crime towards each other, except for a few bullet holes in this one and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and are considered to be related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the published information, in a first case on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and managed to save one who had been deprived of liberty.
They were confiscated from three buildings and a cell phone; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another fact that took place on November 12 at 06:00, military personnel made a surveillance route to Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13, at 2 p.m., one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are given clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the entire eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed of technocrats in his majority, although it is unclear when the new executive will assume his post.
Monti said he was going to present the president with the result of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
The “frame is now well-trodden,” he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in less time than usual, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels impossible to sustain.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a harsh austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Underscoring the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the performance of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, the leader of the Italian boss Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, to which the crisis forced him to resign last Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts will have a good result,” said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed the technocrat majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by noting that a Monti bankruptcy would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers’ groups and youth and women’s organizations on Monday.
He will finish his meeting tour Tuesday night.
Monti was named on Sunday by Napolitano, who authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief pause at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over the new prime minister’s success.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for Eurozone’s current financial defences.
Monti said his government should continue until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before the elections are over.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be formed only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spaniards is greater than that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convocateurs participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 invited by the two countries for today’s friendly at 15:05 hours at the Stade National de San José.
While the national and European champions, number one in FIFA’s monthly rankings, have a broad record of Class A inter-selection games, Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) against Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, maintain an intense activity every year in league and national cup championships and competitions in European Cups such as the Champions League.
To all this, we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated eliminations of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have limited international experience to an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be at a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record of the Spanish national team is that of goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) equalled the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Tricolore today and they will set a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, Barcelona's cerebral pilot, in a 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized by UEFA the previous week alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke’s centre-forward Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez with 102.
Carles Puyol is a 100-year-old player with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az, with 48 presences and the striker Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five exceeded the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31) are among the most popular.
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var only has one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not yet starting.
Spain's historic goalkeeper is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz recorded the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
“Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true.”
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at Stade National.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures them that it will also be a dream come true to happen in this country.
It was that bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its two-decade working tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles group The X and the Las Robertas Nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will take place in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far this has been great.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once on vacation; it’s such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
This is why we are excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion to the group, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to pass until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve offered over the past 21 years have taken place in the past two weeks.
We have offered a two giant shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing it.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of surfers friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that’s how we learned, through the people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you have offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never been there, we have no restrictions as to what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What's this about?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, that’s why it’s very difficult to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played in a long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved those songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you will celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve accomplished?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don’t think any of us ever imagined that we were going to form a great rock band, and the fact that we did it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and being able to continue to make music together excites us a lot.
We love and love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world we have always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group of great groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it’s much stranger when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to still be friends with all of them and it’s an honor for us to be part of that sound from Seattle that has emerged.
It’s also very strange that a group like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much longer than many bands normally last.
First of all, I think we are all lucky enough to still be alive, and secondly, we all care about each other.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t go any better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure we don’t spend too much time on tour because it’s easy to fall into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
If we don’t forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect music and what brought it, without thinking about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn’t really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and we didn’t release a record before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of frustrations about the fact that it lasted so little and the most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or I see a photo I think of the amazing person that Andy made fun of, it was always fun to work with and laugh at me.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and that's why you chose him for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we liked the most, so we’re looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it has to be very distracting.
Why do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge relevant despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the grunge word.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I’ve just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have emerged at the same time and, if that’s relevant now, I think it’s wonderful because it’s a music that’s never worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are doing it better now.
At first, her music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
That’s interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very obscure songs, even though they may sound a bit positive.
With the two of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I heard them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there’s trauma in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things start to affect your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
I also think that one can also be happy and even like that one can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength in his feet, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000) suffers from various conditions, including a tongue cancer for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, told Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of rendition of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, probably, he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
It has been operated four times on tongue cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been incarcerated since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people due to an army annihilation squadron that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official cortege, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and made up of various ministers and bosses, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, the high point of a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "suitable for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations," according to information published by the South American country's Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when the French ambassador, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude countries that continue to be tax havens from the international community, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador to that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20, a group of the world’s strongest emerging and developed countries since November, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to push for the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the “grey list” of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international tax cooperation standards.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have in place since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustachu plumber goes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of evil Bowser, but he had never done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, was designed from the beginning to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy without glasses should work,” said Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, Nintendo’s chief press officer in Spain, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this support" because so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson said that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows for a fast and fluid game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang the less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second turn" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional Super Mario incursion also presupposes the return of the character to a mobile console, which has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo takes a look at the fans of the saga and repeats the successful formula of the previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustachu plumber must travel through mined platforms of danger to free Princess Peach.
Although I player finds new features in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the case of Luigi "playable".
Colom endorses the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the $70 million laundering conspiracy.
Thus, the trial ends for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that Portillo was demanding to judge.
In a press conference, Colom claimed that his decision complied with the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and had given way to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done implies an executive approach after exhausting all judicial and constitutional bodies to judge the former 2004-2004 mandater.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was absolute for diversion of Q120 million funds to the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the trial leading up to extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter century.
In addition to this, there are hundreds of jobs that are currently being created by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock in an event celebrated in a former Fabra i Coats industrial complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the goal of helping poorly educated people, without work, with drug problems or marginalized.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of officials of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the election season, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Alongside the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and former Deputy Mayor and current municipal eco-socialist adviser Ricard Goma attended the event.
The current Minister of Social and Family Welfare, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries and the Director General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa also attended in the large room of Fabra i Coats.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president gave Trinijove as an example to know how to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-partys, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of 51 Balmes Street were living had come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned the building they were illegally occupying and organizing micro-fests that were desperate for neighbors, by court order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
"From this day on, there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest were inhabited-, took away the electrical installation and part of the water, except to paint the walls and leave there residue of all kinds, especially alcoholic drinks cans.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and were desperate for tenants.
Next to the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the building’s occupation its business has decreased by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub mentioned that the intruders of the property made him the disloyal competence, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure resort had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors for the noise, while, according to the latter, the problems were not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants at the parties organized there, who were the most frequent and intense guests.
The manager of the discotheque explained that the troubles were so great that it even resulted in an agreement with the owner of the building and it was nine months ago that the latter "forgives" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors for this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, called last week for "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of communal living and civility that it caused to residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were flights as well.
It is in this sense that he added that "it is necessary to end with impunity and be relentless against the anti-social behavior generated in property".
Also yesterday, the Mossos (Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., police moved to the number 35 in Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide on the opportunity of convening beyond the controversy over the fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already-defunct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this Administration printed promotional posters of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of Metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in numbers, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not oriented on the north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with sleds in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 contests for all the doors to Collserola.
A door brings back the idea of a park, without a doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appears alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation of all the architects of Barcelona.
It’s almost a recurring theme that two members of this former cast of elected officials talk about when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, have coincided.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate on "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green house pastures was not carried out in the end.
"We have to start from the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the title "Collserola gates" contains a "lexical trap": one should not think of these as "access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which one must act".
Modol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
Dangers that stem from "the uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience experienced in the 1980s and that had in the Forum area "his swan song".
The first fear is the very delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
“Limiting something means already establishing the next step,” that is, its overtaking.
“We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can cause genuine disasters.”
On the question, Modol believes that, by simplifying the slope of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, not".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Bossonat de Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers to its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the exception that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success", he says) that one has to create: "We, the architects, should be only one instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because from the basis of the contest it lacks an overall vision of Collserola: "We called 16 cross-country competitions - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This is because, at least in this case, he has chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In its opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the strip immediately superior to that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal and this will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, Casino Red’s legal power foundation granted forgiveness to the mayor of Monterrey’s brother for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After 72 years of detention, Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal will be released after the foundation of the legal power of Casino Red grants him pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a blackmail trial against the mayor’s brother.
After the Casino Royale attack, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s allegedly required him to pay an economic fee for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the gambling house to function clandestinely.
After the public denunciation, the Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal trial against Mayor PANiste’s brother and on September 2, he was arrested and kept in provisional detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Ministry Agent 3 of Heritage Crimes, he was transferred to the Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days when a second warrant of detention was issued to him after the Public Prosecutor's Office opened up the corruption and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta Criminal Center allegedly for having made the owners of Casino Red sing with a million and a half pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial contained in the municipal cells of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza.
On 25 October, an arrest warrant was issued by the clerk of the Second District Criminal Tribunal, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine the guilt of Jonas, such as that relating to the exchange of 1.5 million pesos of his representatives.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of Casino Red, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to apologize for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore, he could regain his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Public Prosecutor attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez whether the damage had been recovered and which of the associates of the gambling house had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
Pursuant to file 197/2011, legal pardon is granted to Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal and subsequently no claim can be made in relation to the trial against him; he will not be asked for compensation for damages and no punishment either.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n was ordered.
The clerk of the Tribunal, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been legally pardoned and his case would be classified.
He will also inform him of the immediate order of freedom issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come gives details of the air crash in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and seven others lost their lives
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and seven others lost his life, indicated that the helicopter directly crashed into the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to do so.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the unit has had various contacts with the ground, the blades have been in contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit has lost the fuselage."
It also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so the unit met the requirements for transporting staff.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact area did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a research it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was structurally presented.
“The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements for transporting them.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the Secretary has ensured that a priority is to have the results as soon as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, General Manager of Airports and Auxiliary Services, ensured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Major State was operating at cruising speed and this happened on an ascending soft ground.
“This information supports the hypothesis of normal operation cruise at the time of impact,” he says.
During the press conference, the holder of the TBS, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Full visual:
According to the aviation regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of the visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions for take-off, and as the aircraft advanced to the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were low-altitude cloud layers.
Selected Routes:
It is likely that because of the cloudiness conditions the crew searched for a lower height area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has taken place on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The model for dispersing the remains of the aircraft makes it possible to assume that the helicopter hit the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
Traces of fire or explosion have not been detected:
At the scene of the crash there is always no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the fieldwork, pieces of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above the average sea level, the ground had a slope that goes from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful search in a wider area than the surrounding area, around the accident, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the assumption that the impact took place under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find the Obesity Gene
Social Insurance Leads Investigation to Discover the Obesity Gene in Children and Young People; This Is Supported by IPN Specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people, called the "Children and Adolescent Obesity Genetics" protocol, which will have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital des Specialités of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and third-cycle students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation is invited to participate in the rightful or non-rightful population, to attend the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where evidence is given to minors every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that as of October 8, the activity takes place in the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research and that of knowing the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and identifying risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their family history of their diseases, to avoid the risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays it will be applied to all participants of anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference of size), blood pressure, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (the aim is to identify the associated genes).
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
“The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in just six years there has been a 77 percent increase in obesity in boys and 47 percent in girls; there has also been a dramatic increase in overweight,” said the IMSS specialist.
He pointed out that the justification for marker research is based on the fact that the country’s population is different from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65 percent Indo-American heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy you consume (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which allows detecting whether they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
Ila even says that the presence of dark color folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, the doctors send it in writing to the parents, to whom each of the measures and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent diseases are explained.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary, which is the lack of daily physical activity, to stay most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transportation instead of walking on distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (palms - meat paste to corn flour wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high fat and pro-logo analysis) with high fat and pro-fat content.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid cracks
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at UNAM’s Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pavement was resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cassis each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, warns Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of the UNAM, who has ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the cassis was completed, it would be necessary to repair the cassis.
During his conference A technological opinion on cassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory of which he is responsible is developing modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalts, but with a higher resistance to asphalts.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera considered that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve performance, and consequently the formation of cracks.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of the oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give its viscous support to the carat.
The viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures of almost 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes cracking, ajouta.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on the environmental and temperature conditions, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México in the majority were covered with a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and compacted later.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he says, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating effort, it allows forces to propagate very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, these would spread better, according to the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he says, we put a last layer called the rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, of the sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion in the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the stresses, the rolling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be treated.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the performance of the asphalt layer.
When the soil is wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to get out, which softens all the layers of the paving and therefore causes cracks.
In the process of forming a cassis, he says, the first that gets lost is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not take place immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that vehicle load is another important factor for cassis formation and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be related to vehicle load and ensure its satisfaction, in order to avoid frequent cassis formation.
Rafael Herrera has warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair cracks easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna not to obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle received her 14th title of Princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night (1989) in Cartagena, where Miss Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1989), Marian (1983), Marian (1983), Marian (1983), Marian (1983), Marian (1983), Marian (1983), Marian (19), Marian (1983), Marian (1983), Marian (1983), Marian), Marian), Marian (1983), Marian (1983), Marian (1983), Marian (1983), Marian (1983), Marian), Marian), Marian), Marian (1983), Marian), Marian), Marian (1983), Marian), Marian, Marian, Marian, Marian (1983), Marian)
Today the big question that many people ask themselves is:
What was missing? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected to the Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie de Vogue, the titles obtained by the Queens of Navarro or the Queens of Navarre.
The first factor considered key in the jury’s decision to appoint her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question “What was the book that marked you and why?” posed by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of the Valle candidate to this question:
“I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it’s a form of culturalization, I definitely believe that the book that marked my childhood is ‘The Little Prince’, it’s a pretty deep book.
Now I am reading Crime and Punishment, a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I am reading the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called The Burning of Blood.
This answer did not please at first because of the term "culturalization" and, secondly, not to explain in concrete terms how each book cited marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what must happen.
And for everyone, read, please, "The Little Prince" is a great book"
Among the assumptions made is that Valle was destroyed by favouritism.
A journalist from Bogota hinted that being the favorite, the ovation and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (the Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the jealousy of the other candidates", stressed the queen and it's not because she didn't care.
And this was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Although at the two parades she had seemed sure of herself, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the RCN's "Como en casa" program, said that the fact that Melina was named princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who wins most of the awards during the contest does not receive the Queen's crown."
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That’s why two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of her country.
“Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, one has to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before the competition starts they are already involved in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle has sinned for his shortcomings behind his back and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury chose him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queen preparer Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco acknowledged that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which was actually not too familiar to me, left her points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the journal Cromos considers that the mistake of the Valle candidate was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
“Surgery is good, but Valle didn’t know how to do it.
Her body has never been her asset and she has lost because of this aspect.”
For this award, which the National Beauty Contest presents for the first time, after the swimsuit parade came a cruel prediction that happened last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo was making to Melina so as not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that today Melina begins a year of rule, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by appointment of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A dactyloscope of Cali has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, a CTI dactyloscope specialist from Cali went down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Farc's supreme leader: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopes working in the local offices of the CTI, this week was the “availability” tour of Eliasar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a Puerto Tejada man who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in the municipalities of Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after taking adequate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of the skin of friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against the alias Alfonso Cano, Elijah was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that it was suspected that one of them was that of the man who was leading the world’s oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n S<0xC3><0xA1>enz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the body site, he did not recognize him by his physical appearance, because he was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a pick-up and a lantern, Eleazar compared the digital footprints of the corpse with those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the head who confirmed to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n that yes, he was the supreme leader of the Farc.
In search of the imprint
For a Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n de Cali dactyloscoper, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliasar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
Apart from identifying the bodies, dactyloscopicists support investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many criminals present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove a part of the wall from a house, because in this place the thief had pressed his hand to get out a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to pull a digital footprint, but in this case we were able to get the full hand print and identify the offender who had participated in different flights,” he recalls.
Imprints may also disprove or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently, a dead man was found with bottles of liquor around him.
Through the investigation it was determined that a parent might be suspected of the crime and indeed a print on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee he's the killer, it puts him on the crime scene.
A CTI dactyloscope expert explained that “the fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents” were extracted.
When they appear, a pick-up or strip is used to pick them up.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the declension database, or to the National Civil Registry.
“The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians without papers,” said the CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not gold, everything that you touch does not necessarily become an imprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is carried out.
The 'indignities' challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters marched in front of the Zuccotti square to camp there.
A large part of the people had access to the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The Occupy Wall Street movement members challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, thanks to a court order, in place of Manhattan, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Great Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters were marching in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to gain access through a court order that allows the 'indigned' to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there was once more.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the response of the 'indignities' to the evacuation of their camp dictated personally by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg arrived at the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the 'Indignated' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue power plants, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which joins New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved in and arrested a few protesters, even though Bray was unable to confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw a few journalists who had also passed handcuffs.
The organization ensures that there are hundreds of people who have settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders has moved in support of members of the movement and tried to intervene in their behalf before the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private-owned venue - remains closed pending the celebration of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which the legality of the evacuation must be analysed.
Some protesters who had been displaced so far were carrying and distributing copies of this court order at that time and they even delivered it to the officers who were monitoring the square, which caused 'some small clashes', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials hit the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street or from enforcing “laws issued after the start of the occupation or prohibiting protesters from accessing the park again with tents or other properties they previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that because of this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, to whom he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councilor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn in Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the protesters ‘violated the law’.
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the evacuation because it became “a place where people came not to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to harm other people,” because “some stores had received threats” and residents were afraid of their lives.
“The evacuation this morning at dawn has been repugnant and shows that at the bottom of Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers,” the movement’s spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “not respecting freedom of expression.”
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they do not intend to hold “big actions” for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescuer in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Canadian television Christmas program.
CTV's private television channel announced today that Anderson, alongside the "crooner" Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be on the "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" television program next December 1 performing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the widespread Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband at the time, the drummer of "M<0xC3><0xB6>tley Cr<0xC3><0xBC>e", Tommy Lee, appeared dressed as the Virgin Mary in a puddle.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as Joseph.
Along with Anderson and Peters, CTV’s Christmas special program also features Canadian singer Buble, who married the Argentinean model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who himself is not far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American singer Kim Kardashian a "putty" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan was reborn after the earthquake
GDP rises by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of decline in early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, convalescing even after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country since World War II.
The first estimates by the Government of Tokyo calculated the material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, gross domestic product data between July and September were used to turn the page permanently: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% at annualized rates.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of increase since the period January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real driver of the Japanese economy is not solely based on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate – or rebuild – the infrastructures, to use the deficiencies to grow from scratch.
Japan has woken up mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo took to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refugee values" chosen by investors who fled the eurozone debt crisis and the U.S. forecast disturbances, a privilege that weighs like a glitch in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic buoyancy is determined by the health of major technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, were responsible for their poor performance between July and September when the yen was quoted.
While markets continue to have their seats in the EU’s peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government does not lower the guard.
“We need to monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
And, in fact, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries presented clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being held back.
For this one dropped four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is at level 100, down eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens is fuelling doubts again.
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written pledges
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty re-installed in the parks, Greece continues to meddle in the labyrinth that leads to the coming out of the big European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consensus” of the new Hellenic Transitional Government is rather imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos reported yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days established in his appointment will be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he could not support them again.
“The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26th summit,” Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programs to boost employment, reform the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not cast doubt on his position: “We have committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we have committed to nothing more.”
The conservative leader has gone a step further in his pulse than the EU and the IMF, the agencies that need to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still annoyed by the impact caused by the all-out Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the troika inspectors would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the elements needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although there is no definitive date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stresses Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
“Spain has reached a leading place at the global level in the role of Microfinance.”
Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor on the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation whose “essence” lies in the fact that it is an “instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity.”
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the 5th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations in 2015, and, "very much to the extent that it has been achieved with the goal of achieving the Millennium Development Goals", which has been achieved in the same way as in the past.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and takes on this task with "responsibility", reported Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions of the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "guarantee the benefits for the creation of new capacities and greater resources for the creation of new capacities and greater resources.
We’ve achieved a lot of goals and we’re facing a lot of challenges.”
The Microcredit Summit is considered not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to push "two basic goals".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that at the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impetus in the design of microcredit in Spain and in the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work of which she had known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project "has contributed to the qualification" yesterday.
Finally, Queen Sof<0xC3><0xAD>a ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jimenez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered microcredits to be "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of developed countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of repression.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the "success" of giving "trust" to the people "excluding all those who close the door"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its doors solidly".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President with universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned for the programme but imposed itself in the fall, particularly to satisfy activists who judge the government's policy too lax towards the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the Management Board, was adopted in near-unanimity.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes that they were entitled to, after their interventions, Angela Merkel then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The chancellor's idea - and the motion - holds a slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but this could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission with universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe".
This is, in any case, one of the motions adopted by the Congress, which is clearly inspired by Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the CDU leaders believe Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the trail is set.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by a overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh each country's weight in the European Central Bank's directorate based on the weight of each economy, which was obviously back to strengthening Germany's weight.
Concerned about calming the climate within her party, the chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but she has also not sought to win her congress on the backs of the "small" European countries or countries in trouble prompt to criticize the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the hole.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What Is Fraud in Sick Stops?
After the allocations, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on disease arrests.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family allowance fund, and deliver a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts with a desire to make savings in a context of rigor, but is no less an announcer of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on disease arrests.
First, for the purpose of budget savings: the government plans to impose a fourth day of deprivation on private employees before taking charge of a work stoppage.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of salary, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could provoke anger, but could bring in <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>280 million, according to Les Echos.
And who would be accompanied by another measure, of a more symbolic scope: to impose on the civil servants a day of indemnity in case of work stoppage (they do not have until now a period of incapacity, as opposed to three days in private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also relaunches the topic of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will be reimbursed," Xavier Bertrand told RTL's micro on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the ad effects appear to be somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work-stop fraud.
It has, in fact, been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, most of which have borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditures in 2008, with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% were for maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% were for sick leave, or <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
2.5% of health expenses.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days off from work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by career management website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any sick leave days.
Another study, this time from Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months, and 11% beyond.
When comparing them with their European neighbours, French employees are no more inclined than elsewhere to stop working.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) ranged in France from 10% to 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud on sick leave represents very little in the face of black work.
As for fraud, it only reaches a small extent.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks on sick leave for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million controls, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of more than 45 days of systematically controlled arrests, 11% of cases were "unadjusted or unjustified" out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
In total, therefore, 169,000 “unjustified” cases, out of several million employees who had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little face, for example, that of working in the dark.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, the author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of tax-earning deficit per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than the fraud of the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to reshape its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said on Monday in front of Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his union government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
“In order to continue the economic recovery efforts, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme,” said the head of government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the vote of confidence debate in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake," he added.
As a result, Papadémos predicted that the country's public deficit would be reduced "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the right-wing leader, on Monday supported the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity.
“We will not vote in favour of new measures,” he said at a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the goals of reducing deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan needed without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and would not be forthcoming.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says a committee of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to Royal Society of Canada report
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
Upon entering the game, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death.”
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire that most Canadians have to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, in Quebec, this rate is highest, with 86% of deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that they do not want to change anything in the Criminal Code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons who are not competent or not consenting.
On the contrary, said Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, in a teleconference yesterday, more cases of these overflows would be found in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia because they believe it would allow end-of-life people to ease their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled have less value.
As for people who have committed assisted suicide, the survey found that 41% of those who have committed suicide believe that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or discontinuing care in a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be trained in the duty to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecutions.
In terms of palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and doctors to work together to ensure better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered when it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some health law experts have already made reservations regarding the findings of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a health law specialist, called the position of the experts signing the report "extremely", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill patients.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 could ask what help they can help kill themselves," said Deschamps, who had consulted with a summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
But “in society,” he says, “there are signs and constraints.”
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she called "pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, specifically disputes the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, both in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Damas denounces a "complet"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the foreign ministry’s premises.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday over Bashar al-Assad’s Syria, which, with Russia’s support, resists them and denounces a “complet” against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors of Syria, took a stand in favor of President Assad’s departure.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “remove power” in Syria where 40 civilians and members of the regime’s forces were still killed.
“If Bachar had the interest of his country at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,” Jordan’s King said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, lamented that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have been a failure.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country in which Turkey is adopting an increasingly tough line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a “strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone in the face of repression in Syria,” said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s forces have died in the Deraa region of southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians have died "during gunfights and heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was “going towards the end of the crisis.”
He also reacted strongly to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria “will not flex,” he added, assuring that “the wedded plots against Syria will fail.”
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a “civilian protection mechanism” and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s crackdown, which he said is locked in “paranoia.”
An extraordinary new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to review the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on November 2, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities facing the challenge and the release of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said yesterday that the Arab League’s decision was “wrong” while China urged Syria to implement the exit plan, while maintaining support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, demanded some time in the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "victims", in order to recover lost credibility in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussions with the political parties yesterday before meeting the unions and the board of directors today.
It should set up a relatively limited cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
“Monti spoke about an important program with a lot of sacrifices,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the President of the designated Council.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, saying, "certainly markets will be patient and understand."
His appointment by the president was initially hailed by the markets, but the concern rose again, particularly after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed prime minister should form a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislation, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti, once in office, committed himself to working urgently and with the aim that Italy "becomes the protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that “even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change.”
The EU, convinced that Rome will not reach its budgetary balance target in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for new austerity measures.
Italian “patron of bosses” Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because a country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit parameters.”
Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as a European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of the serious" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy is expected to place <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 billion in government bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped Iran’s nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Safety Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA said last week it was "seriously concerned" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, which was widely used in IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades from the 1960s in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), and would have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then co-operate with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "was aided by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but who, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked in the core of its nuclear deterrence program during the country's nuclear deterrence program.
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes Increase by 50 Percent
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence declined slightly or slowed, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% increase, against a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% overall increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again,” Human rights First said, “the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant,” the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a grave violation of human rights," said Paul Legendre, a senior human rights official.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he said, adding that this could lead to an improvement in police reports on “hate crimes.”
The “crime of hatred” in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual belonging.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter on Monday introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service a little more like that of Facebook.
A new “activity” tab and another “name” tab make it possible to follow the activity of other “Twittos” more readable, the users whose messages (“tweets”) and those who follow you live.
This lets you know if they are tracking messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast across the network Monday, Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its non-intrinsic operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to relay a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making the happiness of the initiates, thus opening up to a wider audience with a more similar handling to that of the public Facebook+ networks.
On the network, users were suddenly debating "tweets" that decided on the interest of this innovation.
“It’s useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” wrote <0x40>jemb123.
“The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter feed,” <0x40>dannykronstrom wrote.
Austria-Hungary
Inscription of a Budgetary "Gold Rule" in the Constitution
The government of the great Social-Democrat/Christian coalition in power in Austria on Tuesday decided to enrol in the constitution a budgetary "golden rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid any degradation by the rating agencies of the sovereign rating of the Autriche (Autrile).
It is the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who himself announced this decision after a council of ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, largely above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy.
“If Austria’s solvency was reduced by just one tap, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros of interest in addition each year,” said Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria follows a request from the Eurozone member countries to hold a summit in Brussels on 26 October: the heads of state and government had then requested the registration by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a currency.
The system adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model", with Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease every year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, as of 2017, the federal government's structural public deficit will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to budget it.
The objective is to move public debt to the 2020/21 horizon under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen Fort
Noda threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen went back not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold massive yen against dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just set a new record of validity since 1945 against the green bill.
But the yen has been steadily rising since then, doped by purchases by investors who see it as a “refugee value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar rose below the 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of the 105 yen, near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro was worth more than 160 yen.
This Japanese currency’s slump is detrimental to the archipelago’s exports as it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues from overseas by Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of March 11 that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), said Noda, who fears that this enrichment of the yen will not kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The world’s third-largest economic power rebounded with growth in the third quarter – 1.5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of households flooded by the disaster.
But the prime minister ruled that the yen’s price did not reflect “Japan’s economic fundamentals.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which on Tuesday opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", suggesting that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bonds by 5.000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling of the amounts it devotes to the purchases of various financial securities.
Eurozone:
the rates are rising, the stock exchanges are flanking
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis always undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
Always worried about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are sinking a little further into negative territory, on Tuesday 15 November.
At 10 a.m. in Paris, CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt is down 0.4% and London is down 0.1%.
“With the new tensions over the returns on the euro-zone countries’ borrowings in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make part of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are just too aware of the risk of contagion,” Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7%, suffering in turn from renewed fears from market players about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has a keen eye on Europe and exchanges will continue in a corridor of narrow variations as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concerns about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1,3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she withdrew after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, meeting in congress on Monday, adopted a motion including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very alarming levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian bonds at 10 years of age reached 6.85%, that of Spanish bonds of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over the interest rates of the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of the stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, called for time in the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxia by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, said the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is at the forefront of markets, while the country’s legislative elections are held on Sunday.
The rate gap ("spread") between Germany's and Spain's 10-year obligations has reached a new, higher historical one.
In anticipation of the growth figures of the euro area
On the statistical side, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, which is slightly better than the expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
However, Insee revised the second-quarter figure downwards, with a 0.1% decline in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And, it’s really the fourth that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy Policy:
The facts must prevail over dogmas.
If it is a subject that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is well known that an election appointment is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and in the place where the nuclear power is held.
The debate will only be successful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic evolution will lead to a doubling of the demand for electricity by 2050, unless a huge part of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the rarification of fossil resources will have to be halted in order to continue to produce electricity permanently, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case either in Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a source of replacement capable of replacing itself, or in Switzerland, which just wants to build only last generation power plants.
On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name a few, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, they decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focused on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts speech.
The choice of Berlin will result in the increase in the price of electricity, an energy dependency aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a surge in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
Within a few months, all of these unpleasant effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
Europe's champion of wind power, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittentness of the wind; by virtue of this, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay an electricity bill of 40% higher than that of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction on the part of the nuclear power plant would generate a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power illusory.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show any opposition in principle to this energy, polls show.
Recall that the energy policy of our country has enabled the construction of an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it brings a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and makes them very creative of non-localizable jobs.
If France were to decide to leave the nuclear power plant, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euro annual French exports of nuclear equipment and services as a matter of urgency.
Which electrician would command an EPR designed to run for sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miracle electricity production, no more so than there is no diabolical one.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power plants, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute must.
We have in France a Safety Authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing plants as well as on the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequence.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident is the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons of this accident, as it did for the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the safety authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it able to withstand such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians eager to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to Areva and EDF competitors by leaving them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy package for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy conducted under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the instigation of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "human rights countries" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students who have made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of May 23) proclaiming in the past that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
It is that there is a fairly broad consensus on this subject between left and right.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who stated in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard, explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared left and right.
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be accorded to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande is turning to banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migratory problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be paid electorally; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent paper synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus on the
Restricting immigration anemia growth and loss of employment.
Fears of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may be replacing national workers, particularly the underqualified, with a downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are far more complementary than substitutes for national employees, practicing for the most part the professions in sectors in which there is a shortage of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which training does not follow the job offer.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will have trouble working in a country that has a shortage of anesthetists, these complementarities between national and migrants make immigrant arrivals have a positive effect on national wages and employment.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real long-term wages.
And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of immigrants naturalized among the U.S. Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (receipts minus expenses) of 150000 euros to the average public budgets over the course of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to go looking for the missing growth points "with teeth".
The teeth in question, serving to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a precious commodity; it is also a fragile commodity.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the goulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Gre.
Some believed that it would be enough, for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way possible.
It is known, since Napoleon, "the Little One", that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition of it and can even become an "instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, the Light, economic and social solidarity, a justice.
The crisis of Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also, and first of all, a crisis of politics and democracy.
In this respect, the palinody of the true and false Greek referendum will have had the value of twofold revelation: that of the need for a powerful return from politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and for many of them, the Republican soldiers are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in a dispersed order.
A white-singing to the absolute European monarch or a leap on foot together in the void of nationalist reprisal: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cuts, but a common exercise of full right, peaceful and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we can no longer stop the listing - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that adheres to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the management of the European project.
For it is together that the Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare the future by investing.
The crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be made without full democratic legitimacy, except, of course, to lead us to disaster.
After fighting this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors for a long time, everyone today demands the European economic government.
Let's go.
But to think without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We need to take a new step in European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" the Republicans.
The revolution in the interests was not enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe politically, a true European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
The "contactless" smart cards are widespread
The global smart card show opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most bearer segment is that of contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or to settle your purchases by simply approaching a reader’s card.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to grow further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and account for nearly 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
For a long time on the Asia-Pacific region’s trail, Europe has gained ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa credit cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double mouthpieces.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards.
In order to move to higher speeds, banks now need to equip their customers.
“Two major French institutions have committed to systematically distribute contactless bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for making transactions.
"They've been late."
"But they should finally know a real boost next year."
“We are counting on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 worldwide,” said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Company, too, said yesterday to prepare the launch of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front expands
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Suspected of long-standing ties between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers has now “acquired certainty.”
“The way the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation,” he said without further ado.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January is said to have updated the bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their captors during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Axe Terrorism
The analysis of past calls points to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maiduguri, a northern Nigerian city, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who claims to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is an advance, but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for years that the sect has benefited from external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" had become increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operating modes, which now involve the use of kamikazes or increasingly complex explosive devices and the same bill as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illuminators of little interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram – which means in Hausa “Western education is a sin” – advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is very successful.
She politicizes herself and demands strict respect from the sharia while her activists engage in the fight against the impoverished central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, increasing the number of attacks on police stations.
Abuja’s reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invests the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on the sect will radicalize and leave its fiefs from the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In June, it was in Abuja that Boko Haram took over the police’s secure QG during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations’ local headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would navigate from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria is now a concern for all security specialists.
While Aqmi has invested in Mali and Niger, which the Somalis of al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all the information".
The World According to Republican Candidates for Presidency
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete for simplicity and ignorance.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
To listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying the tonifying statements and shortcomings of foreign policy, traditionally a strong Republican point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans – often unsupported – were.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the "Grand Old Party" nomination, threatened to drag the Chinese in front of the WTO and challenge them "for manipulation of their currency", a bearer theme in a desperate America by migrating entire swaths of its industry to Asia.
So bad if it has to involve triggering a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to Obama’s China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has failed to strangle himself in the face of an attitude that “flattens” the emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
In the image of Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop his nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing his obligations towards this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows an embarrassing misunderstanding of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing “is trying to develop a nuclear capability” – apparently unaware that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, said he was ready to engage the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water into his anti-terrorism wine.
They rightly insist on the failure of his na<0xC3><0xAF>ve dialogue with Iran, on the too rushed departure of Iraq's "boys", on his misrepresentations in Libya, thus sticking to him a weak label.
But the attack is not that easy.
The population is rather positive about Obama’s national security balance sheet, which eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been wary of military interventions that lead to incarceration.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
The Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, connecting Western Europe directly to Russia by passing to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event brightly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part on Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between orchestra and fine buffet, at the opening of the Nord Stream, this new gas pipeline that connects directly, under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together the valve steering wheel commanding the entry of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe via a first 1,224 km tube connecting the Saint Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline is due to be completed at the end of 2012, delivering a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third on the same path.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and in time of this huge project has an air of victory.
The project had been heavily contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land crossing by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
Therefore, these two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by providing its support to this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But this is at the cost of a weakening of Europe's energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has been able to triumph over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which are heavily gas consumers, and whose deposits are declining.
“This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it’s a new artery that binds us organically,” Fillon confirmed by inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating just how politically and economically large gas contracts are.
All this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, who are in number in Lubmin, at the gas arrival point.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of cast concrete steel to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at 200 m on average.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from the Second World War.
“A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, by precaution,” said Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply the measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, as heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which does not interfere with its entire length: no valve, no maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project officials gave up on it while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state company establish permanently off their coast.
“In case of an accident, we stop the gas passage in less than a minute,” says Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
In the event of leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline thus escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who planned the welds to experience a leak every 100,000 years.
The monitoring of the state of the pipeline is carried out by an underwater robot, carried by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus that circulates inside the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, one meter wide in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, it provides accurate information on possible deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to run for fifty years without having to undergo any repair.
The circulation of the gas is simply ensured by the pressure.
It is 200 bars at the start, and 100 at the arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies set up a joint venture, Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company, for twenty renewable years, all of its gas transportation capacity.
“Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported,” says Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was provided to 30% by the shareholders and to 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the work is expected to reach <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to get back into their fees, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that arrives, before it is transferred to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012 it will be 6 million.
Moleskine, a trademark.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give back the taste of writing.
It has a perfume of adventures, of hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine booklet is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as they age over time.
Yet the Moleskine booklet as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design notebook but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is in charge of launching the new product.
The booklet is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin (taupe skin) that designates a varnished cotton used to cover banquets for example.
This type of booklet was very appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has given to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who became the brand's manager at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces sold.
We are far from the confidential production of the early years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a robot portrait of the buyer, because the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
In the image of Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, counts almost 100 today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its books in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops in the city centre and has been able to impose its identity.
“We’ve followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails,” says Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own booklet.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer covers... The brand stands out over a whole range of supports.
A success that has made envious: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for workers with disabilities still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of persons with disabilities opens today.
Despite a voluntary public policy in place in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the entire population.
Disheartening?
“No,” said Eric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of people with disabilities.
" The progress made in the last fifteen years is considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
“There’s still a lot to do.”
It must be said that for the disabled, there are many obstacles to access to employment.
They are quite old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have the baccalaureate and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it uniquely difficult to return to work, and that "constitute the knot of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies recruit workers with disabilities.
This is for the objective brakes.
The unsaid remains, the mindsets that are evolving, certainly, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Enterprise for the City association indicated that the managers interviewed had "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "overrepresentation of wheelchair users, mental or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the employment target of 6% of workers with disabilities, set out in a... 1987 law.
The last known figures, which date from 2008, account for a ratio of 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” said Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of "taxed " establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also translates to a real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ workers with disabilities, compared with 82 per cent of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What happiness"
Before facing the Blues on Tuesday evening (20h45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match provides them.
It is not until we write that there was a connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months after the mood gesture of his striker against Turkey, the Belgian selector has only praise to do about him.
“I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian.”
“I want to go forward,” Lillois assured.
As for the contrast between his club and selection, "it's a whole, he justified himself."
“In Lille, I’ve been there all year, which is not the case with Belgium.”
"I have to take my marks."
Hosted against Romania on Friday night for this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brilliant".
Not to mention the notion of “pleasure.”
The Blues, he encouraged them since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a supporter,” he said.
This necessarily contributes to further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
"There is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he said.
"We crossed all the time."
“To be able to play against them is only happiness!”
With bonhomie, Leekens has for his part referred to the "fertile".
"Proud" to argue "a match of gala".
"Proud" also to note - as a "voice" - that France "has become a very high level team" a little over a year after the trauma of Knysna.
“Laurent Blanc did a thunder job,” he said.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be happy to share the plane with the Blues in direction... Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are getting big,” he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You're going to see it in the next matches." The match against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Bento begins with a lot of optimism his dam back to Bosnia (22h00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
By the way, both teams had lacked realism.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento can be seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Select<0xC3><0xA7>ao, which he has been in charge of since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to bowl.
In view of the match going (0-0), Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to score such a valuable goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, but there's some risk because we haven't scored a goal outside."
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as bubbling, even if the party obviously announces itself "very tight", said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are quite confident we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,” Carlos Queiroz’ successor said.
The zero reported Friday from Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to score and win.
One zero can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but there's a certain risk because we didn't score a goal outside," Bento regrets.
"We will play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians so as not to "give them time to think."
A good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic, this time.
