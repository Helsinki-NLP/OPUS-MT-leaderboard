Four members of the Kemerovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the postman, the police in Spain detained Slava Gulevich, the head of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the lower part of Estonia, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevitch, who was detained in Spain, was arrested on bail.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects detained in Estonia.
It is suspected that the so-called members of the criminal community in Kemerovo are between the ages of 27 and 57, who mainly commit drug offences.
In the province of Malaga in Spain, the alleged leader of the criminal community was detained in Mijas.
Three men were arrested in Estonia, one of them being a leading figure in the criminal community, according to data, and two being members of the criminal community.
The data collected indicate that the tasks and roles of the criminal community were clearly separated.
The aim of the criminal community’s activities was to carry out drug offences and thereby earn criminal income,” said Vahur Verte, head of the criminal court’s pre-trial procedure.
“We do not rule out that the circle of suspects in this criminal case is increasing,” the prosecutor added.
These are people who have also previously become interested in law enforcement, and some of them have been punished for drug offences.
Blood stressed that throughout the investigation there has been a significant presence of cooperation with Spanish colleagues.
“International cooperation has become commonplace for us and this week’s operation shows the success of the cooperation,” Verte said.
Ago Leis, head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said the pre-trial investigation took almost a year and a half to complete.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work was realized and we were arrested at the same time in Estonia and Spain for suspected crimes," he said.
Leis added that the Central Criminal Police officers were assisting in the detention in Spain.
For years we have had good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil card forces.
These arrests are another message to the criminals that we can get them from the other side of Europe," Leis said.
The information collected so far clearly indicates that in the absence of freedom, suspects may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor’s office requested their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia.
Within the framework of this criminal case, property, vehicles and cash have been arrested to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial procedure in the criminal case is carried out by the Central Criminal Police Organized Crime Bureau and is headed by the State Prosecutor’s Office.
In 2005, the Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevi<0xC5><0xA1>i of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the previous decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the criminal world in Estonia, after the underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevit<0xC5><0xA1>, from Kemerovo, emerged in the lower part of Estonia in the early 1990s, when he began to deal with extortion in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes working at various hotels and demanded a monthly roofing fee from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of proceeds of crime and court decisions in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the recent judgments in the so-called Dikayev Criminal Community case, which was handed down to eight defendants, who were seized of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>80,000 in criminal income, or the judgment of nine persons that the Igor Aleynikov case was committed in 2006 with a criminal offence and that the case had been closed by a court of appeal.
The amount of the confiscated criminal proceeds is approximately EUR 71,500.
In these criminal matters, success has been ensured by the fact that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and, if necessary, joint actions are carried out in any country of the European Union.
Citizens' Rights Group Warns of Travel to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri about the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The NAACP travel notice issued for the state of Missouri, valid until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to be the most attentive and respectful of the grasshoppers in the state as they move around the country, the grasshoppers are the most sensitive and the most tender of all.
According to the NAACP, the group was prompted by the issuance of such a recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to win cases on discrimination, as well as the fact that the targets of state law enforcement are in a disproportionately large proportion of precisely the minorities.
“Human rights are being violated.
They are pulled from the teapot because of their skin color, beaten or killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri branch of NAACP, told The Kansas City Star.
“We’ve never had such complaints before.”
This is the first such warning the organization has issued about the U.S. state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults towards black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he got out of the state by gas and was arrested by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped in the state than white drivers.
“The mark is designed to make people aware and to warn their families, friends and coworkers about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared, whether it's taking bail or notifying their relatives that they're going through the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state's number of similar violations in 16th place across the country.
The travel warning is also a response to Missouri’s new law, which makes it harder to sue a company in court for discrimination in search of a home or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after these states passed immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because the ACL was heavily infringing.
The foreign ministry usually issues travel warnings for other countries, but interest groups have recently begun to use this measure in response to certain U.S. domestic laws and trends.
Hepatitis: what could everyone know about the different forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis, or liver inflammation, can be caused by five different types of hepatitis A, B, C, D and E.
All of these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C may develop into cirrhosis of the liver, i.e. liver stiffness and liver failure.
Kuulo Kutsar, an expert in epidemiology at the Ministry of Health, says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, sitting, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loud discharges, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and joint pain
The last sign of the disease is also derived from the folk name of the liver burner kollat<0xC3><0xA6>b.
Children can have hepatitis without any symptoms of the disease.
The different types of liver inflammation can only be determined on the basis of laboratory study data.
Acute hepatitis can become a chronic hepatitis and go on for decades without symptoms, which means that a person may not know anything about their dangerous liver disease.
Listen Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A virus spreads from a sick person and infects us when we eat or drink contaminated food, sex, from the infected person’s stools to food, surfaces, objects, mouth, and drugs.
The risk of hepatitis A, or risk group, includes family members and caregivers of the infected person, people with chronic liver disease, people with the infected person, men having sex, drug addicts, travelers visiting countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular, vaccination is recommended for many travelers and for people at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect the hands, before consuming food, wash all fruits and vegetables.
Hepatitis B viruses are common when exposed to human blood, when injecting drugs, when tattooing, when august, when using blood-contaminated ovaries (tissues, shaving agents), when having donor blood, when having sex with a person with a hepatitis virus, and from the mother to the foetus/infection of hepatitis.
The risk group for hepatitis B includes injectable narcotics, infected human sex partners, men having sex with men, infected mother newborns, sick family members and caregivers, blood and other body fluids in contact with health care, rescuers and police officers of the Hepatitis B and rickets of the ribs.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, in addition to chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and people with diabetes.
Other preventative measures of hepatitis B include: prevention of the use of foreign hygiene and manicure products, other sharps and syringes, tattooing and piercings, and the use of condoms in the event of infectious sex or prevention of sexual risk.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is a part of the national immunisation plan and free of charge for children in Estonia.
Hepatitis C viruses are common in contact with the blood of a sick person, in injection of drugs, in tattooing, in august, in the use of blood-contaminated ovaries, in the use of donor blood, in sex with a person infected with hepatitis, and in the case of hepatitis from the mother to the foetus / newborn.
Among the risk groups for hepatitis C infection include injectable narcotics, infected human sex partners, men having sex with men, infected mother newborns, sick family members and caregivers, blood and other body fluids in contact with health care workers, rescue workers and police inhalers, hepatitis C and swine fever, HIV.
Hepatitis C prevention measures include: prevention of the use of foreign means of hygiene and manicure, other means of sharpening and injections, tattooing and august, and the use of condoms in cases of infectious sex.
There is no hepatitis C vaccine.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of the hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread in contact with blood and other body fluids, infested with syringes, through sexual contact, and rarely infected mothers in foetuses.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people who do not have immunity to hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects the person against infection with the hepatitis D virus.
Hepatitis E viruses spread fecal-orally with drinking water and food, including eating less hot-processed animal meat, fish and sharks, donor blood, co-administered syringes, and infected mammalian foetuses.
Passengers may be infected with high levels of hepatitis E in countries.
The preventive measure for hepatitis E is to meet hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect the hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the sick.
Wash the fruits and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating less hot-processed animal meat, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water, and avoid the consumption of drugs.
While in the final round, the competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic winner off the line, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final round and won 26.49.51 over time.
Farah did not think long, drawing his wife Tania and children to the line after finishing with him.
It was a special moment for me.
I respect my family very much.
Being on the border with them was wonderful,” Farah told reporters.
Farah is aiming for the fifth gold dub at the 5000 and 10,000 metres in a row in London.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Daam in the Gold." Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait of an artwork is immersed in the cultural history of Vienna in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
But even more in-depth history.
The volume of information to be appreciated would be spent on a harder cutting edge, a narrower subject would be reduced to more impact on the extraordinary creation of the portrait allowed in the title.
There are now two books between the same roofs: Gustav Klimt and his painting "Daam Gold" depicts the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a much larger and more comprehensive history of respected Jewish families and German occupation with its consequences in Austria.
The first third of the book takes you into the middle of the bustling Viennese cultural scene and anyone who has settled in the Austrian capital may at the very least struggle to imagine how life went around Ringstra<0xC3><0x9F>e more than a hundred years ago, or how all the heads turned in the Central Café when Klimt entered.
The concentration of cultural experts was high in one of Europe’s richest cities, and seeing the name in the book makes you feel more like a grammatical culture.
However, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where the plague was incurable in syphilis and was Europe’s highest suicide rate, the story seems to give nothing to the development of the story.
Or perhaps still - even every pair of brushstrokes adds color to the cultural revolution of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
During the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had grown exponentially, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten Viennese people were Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newlyweds in Vienna, but by the time Adele married twice to the Czech sugar giant Ferdinand Bloch and to Klimt for his famous paintings, his father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele's whole glamorous life, where she belonged, didn't draw.
When you look at the "Golden Lady", it's hard to believe that the end of life infected this great lady of socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of her husband from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimti’s order paid 4,000 kroner, a quarter of the price of a well-located cottage.
The fact that in some portraits the master's love affair with the model was suspected, the sugar rag did not dissipate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist developed during the work continued for the rest of their lives.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Lady of gold.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Baueri's extraordinary portrait story", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Shortly before the start of work with Ade, Klimt had visited the San Vitale basilica in Ravenna, and the researchers think that the magnificent mosaics of the Empress Theodora gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Ade as a mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Daam's Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and at about the same time (between 1907 and 1908) another golden land "Susudus" was born.
Art historians did not notice the similarity of the two women.
How is Hitler related to history?
“I think in memory of my friend Klimt, I owe it to him to make his handiwork available to the public,” Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist’s departure (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished that their family would go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had completed another portrait of Adel.
Also in his rehearsal (Adele left in February 1925) she asked her husband to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscape paintings to the Austrian Gallery.
He inherited his possessions from his sisters Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated from the Austrian Mona Lisa, he had tried to get to the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna to reach 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but failed to draw.
While Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be the reason that Jewish professors did not accept him to the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery referred to in Mary’s will had changed considerably by 1939 – it had become important to find works pleasing to the Nazi party from the rich Jewish art collections in Vienna.
Some of Adele's work at home was also suitable for Hitler's personal artistic heritage, but not Klimt's.
Sixty years after the demolition of the Nazi art, a decade-long feud between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauerite's heirs began.
It should only be noted here that if the Kiss is seen in the Belvedere Castle in Vienna, then Adele Bloch-Bauer’s “Daam’s Gold” must be seen driving to New York’s New Gallery.
And before the trip to Vienna, read the above book as well.
Even if you don’t plan on going to see Klimt’s work, because at least my emotions turned around after the book closed more Nazi and Jewish themes than the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer sold for $135 million.
So not so much a portrait, rather a family history - and a very moving story.
The Bauerite family tree, which was brought out at the beginning of the book, greatly facilitated orientation in the events.
17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In anticipation, Gold was very close to his 200 m personal surfing record by swimming 2.16.62.
Tippmark is a 17-year-old girl from a week back when the Canadian Juniors’ championship time was 2.16.58, according to the Priit Aaviku Swimming Blog.
Gold finished last, maybe 10th, in the A-final.
In the final, he went through a distance of 2.15.76 and reached a good seventh place with a powerful new top score.
Alina Kendzior’s Estonian record (2.15,13) left Gold a little over half a second apart.
In Estonia’s all-time charts, Gold rose to third, and its fresh personal top score is Estonia’s fifth all-time result.
Young futures are still starting in the 100 m, 200 m and 400 m freestyle and in the 200 m and 400 m complexion at the Canadian adult championships.
Last week, in Toronto, the Canadian Junior Championships were held, and Gold made a successful start there as well.
He won the 200 m freestyle with a silver medal time of 2.03.22.
This was the last time this distance was so quickly swimsuited by Estonia in 2008.
In Estonia, only the Estonian record holder Elina Part<0xC3><0xB5>ka has been able to swim this distance faster than Gold.
Another Estonian who lives in Canada won the bronze medal in the 100 m freestyle with an excellent personal record and a new Estonian season top score of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, who is a year older than him, has only been able to swim this distance a hundred times faster.
He reached his personal peak in the 100 m distance, receiving a letter of time of 1.03.69 in the open exchange of the message.
In the semi-longest distance, he only reached seventh place when swimming in the final 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season charts at four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics brush their teeth
The holiday time is at hand – it also means relaxation for US President Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has been one of the most vacationing presidents to date, critics are already brushing their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president plans to spend a 17-day holiday at his own golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
While the president’s holiday began yesterday, opponents of Trump’s holiday have already taken the floor for a week.
They're throwing Trump too often for a break.
It is the custom of the president to spend a weekend in his Florida, Virginia, and New Jersey villas.
Trump, on the other hand, is not the most ousted president in his 196 days.
George W. Bush, for example, had already been on vacation for 67 days, but Barack Obama was half as much as Trump as he was for 21 days.
However, Trump tends to forget things quickly.
The days after he became president, Trump said in an email that “60 minutes” would be enough time for a long vacation for his official, as there is a lot of work to be done.
He also announced three years ago that Barack Obama was on vacation.
The current president wrote on Twitter: “While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is ripping off the heads of journalists.”
According to White House officials, a 17-day visit to the golf club is not a relaxing experience.
This is officially called a work holiday, during which Trump does not have time to read or engage in other activities.
There had to be another reason for the holiday.
Namely, the air conditioning system in the western part of the White House was replaced and therefore all the staff had to leave.
The western wing also houses the Oval Office and other office spaces of the President.
“I don’t think anyone else would want to be Western in August if it’s 38 degrees and there’s no air conditioner,” White House spokesman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
From where President Trump will spend the next 17 days, you can get an idea from the video.
Blocking Critics from Facebook Don’t Apply to the State Office if You Don’t tolerate Voter Criticism
Our country's father knew about the unfavourable media coverage in so many ways.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for newspapers to start suffocating him for anything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism, of course, angered him.
But he did not force his critics to remain silent.
In 1783, Washington said that “freedom of speech can be taken away from us, and in silence and darkness we can be led to the slaughter of sheep.”
It brings me to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who has to struggle to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates have blocked and deleted at least 450 people’s posts, which posted their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And by the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit against him.
The governor’s office tampered with the request blank and online comments were swirling about counter-reactions in the style of “Who cares?”.
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But it does.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an astonishingly popular republican governor with an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His approval percentage is second among the country’s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a mindless responsive mind.
He has led the state firmly and has remained firmly committed to his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool to communicate with his constituents rather fluently, for example, presenting his bald head for the first time after a chemical treatment.
Thus, the governor’s official-labelled public forum, which is managed by taxpayers’ dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people from visiting staff who receive pay from taxpayers’ dollars.
Hogan's press secretary Amelia Chase defended the governor's behavior in an interview with The Washington Post, claiming that blocking comments was nothing but moderation.
But it’s too easy to paint a picture of the web-swimming internet trolls, spammers, or angry people.
The Post interviewed several real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that's exactly what they're real people who communicate with their chosen leaders. Teacher, business owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and in no way a bitch.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasizing the Catholicism of Hogan.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, did not provoke anger, but rather anger.
"I would politely comment that I am disappointed that he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in a commentary on The Post's news story.
“However, I don’t like the idea that if a lot of people comment on the same topic, some immediately call it a collective effort, rather than admitting that it is a great deal of concern to citizens.”
What the governor's office called a "targeted spam attack", others would probably call "public support".
The Facebook era allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a criticism or deleting a negative comment.
It’s much cleaner than it was when employees had to be sent out to do the same thing to get the critical headlines together and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to shut up.
But that’s exactly what’s happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan isn’t the first government official to be criticized for being bitten by Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who blocked him from the Twitter feed.
One of the first significant judgments on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that the Loudoun County Supervisory Board representative violated the first amendment to the Constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
Kentucky also visited ACLU after the use of Facebook and Twitter by Governor Matt Bevin (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
During the time of Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect to the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous writers narrowed down his management.
And even then, Washington had to stick to anonymous trolls.
People wrote in newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, making Washington’s decisions on the ground.
According to historical documents compiled as part of George Washington’s online letter collection project, he covered the cabinet with petitions that criticized his views on the friendship, trade and shipping agreements concluded with the United Kingdom.
But he didn't force them to shut up.
Freedom of speech, dissent and debate are the starting points of our country.
And the right leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty relies on the comfort of the home territory at the Renaissance Club
Former European figure Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of the home territory in the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open will take place on the golf courses of the East Lothian Renaissance Club.
The Northern Irishman, who was leading the last round of the Archerfield Links on the tracks in the neighborhood last year before being sacked by Paul Eales, is in love with the new venue and plays the role of a tournament sender instead of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I see how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we’ll see how the club will shine in full glory with this event,” Rafferty said.
“The players see the track in its best shape, it’s in a brilliant condition.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He is an enthusiastic supporter of the golf game and feels unattainable pride here.
This will allow the course to be well presented.”
England’s Eales is looking forward to defending the title for the first time, although the man has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It sends a very special feeling," said a player washing in Southport.
“I couldn’t defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off my winning calendar a year later.
It's magical to come back to this place.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year’s win was special.
It was a very special time that we will always have in our hearts.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Seniors in the European Tour at the start of this year, also returns to the competition.
It is his first event in Scotland since taking part in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“At home playing is always a little more meaningful,” said Helensburg man Orr.
“You want to play well, but at the same time you feel the added tension.
I’ve enjoyed playing again and have shown a pretty decent golf game.
I’m happy with the way things are going.”
The trio will be joined by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior Tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder cricket captain Sam Torrance are two of the six schotlas in the race, the rest of whom are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Poverty and Death on the Gold Coast of Indonesia
When Bardina Dege prepares dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
He rarely even uses the pot.
Indonesia’s abandoned wooden house in Enarotal, the capital of the Paniai regency in the province of Papua, puts a housewife in a local language called a note to the fire station.
After half an hour, the combustible tip is taken by fire and the skin is injected with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor without furniture, and there he also does his daily household chores, for example, washing the laundry with dirty water from the nearby sex.
The role of the walker plays the owl in the roofless room.
Since she is the youngest of four wives, she is not assigned to take care of any farm.
Polygamy is common here.
However, late work can be dangerous for most of the village’s men who are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, in addition, there are still soldiers here.
“No one dares to walk around the village after five o’clock in the evening,” he says.
This is a rare sight to behold in the mountains of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed by Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum that sparked controversy, during which only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote by hand in the eyes of the occupying forces.
The movement, which encouraged the liberation of the Dutch from power, quickly moved its anger against the government of Jakarta, which still holds the region under its strong control, keeping foreign journalists and human rights monitors away.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, so independent Papua New Guinea remained the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is just as far away as it is left. To get there, you need to fly from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabires for 90 minutes and then take a five-hour drive to get bored with a rental car.
There is no public transport.
With a population of about 19,000, the city consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo roofs and covered with corrugated iron roofs, whose rust has turned into different shades of charcoal.
Very few Indonesians have taken a trip here, not to mention journalists, and there have been almost no foreigners here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the priests of Mee Pago worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing such clothes,” Degei says, referring to a hand-assembled turban, dark feathers, and a bright silk.
"Before that, we only had plant leaves on our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of people living below the poverty line and one of the worst statistics of infant mortality and illiteracy in Asia.
But this is also true of the whole country of Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of about 153,000 inhabitants in New Jersey, lies the world’s largest and most profitable gold mining company, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Paapua can be trusted with consumables worth an estimated $78 billion.
But these riches are the source of the suffering of the papacy, as they are due to the powerful presence of the Indonesian military.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that Freeport paid local military and military units about US$20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to US$150,000 per officer.
Efforts by the popes to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden one, and with them they are lovingly turned around.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 priests have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the size of the genocide was the result of mass killings in the mountainous regions of the Papuan tribes in the 1970s.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by Indonesian police in the area.
The 2016 report of the Archbishopric of Birsbane "We will lose all" contains testimonies of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial killings, torture (according to one other report, rape and the release of electric shocks are particularly common) and the release of peaceful protests to the river.
“The number of victims is hard to count because such incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, a researcher at Human Rights Watch Indonesia.
The cranes are even more heavily enclosed, as the Papuan natural resources have caused new inflows from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the province’s 3.5 million people are Christians, but the demographics are changing, as Indonesians from the ethnic groups of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi come from Muslim economic migrants.
Japanese family meals sell gado-gados with crispy and mixed vegetables, which are served with peanut butter.
The locals can't compete with them.
“Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local parrots,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old from Paniais, who moved to Jayapura, the province’s capital.
"From the citizens, the papayas of the papaya mama-mama's [women] are therefore losing their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known to the people as Jokowi, promised to address these inequalities and human rights violations in his 2014 election campaign in Papua.
The former coup d'état won 27 of the 29 constituencies in Jakarta's presidential palace, including Paniai.
But in Papua, very little has changed and the locals feel cheated.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the hope that he will fulfill our hopes of restoring justice,” You says.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai struggled with depression.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang a Christmas song in Enarotal, near the slums, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the motorcycle.
The children who were there told them they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers insulted their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and spectators, the drunk soldiers chased the children and beat them with their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, a nearby election commission building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated further.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered in front of a local police station and a football field in order to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting buses and performed the Papua mei pagoda dance, during which they ran around and toured the bird song.
Some of the protesters began to stone the police and the military.
In the wake of the outbreak, an order was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio. "If the mass of the population shows more than three times resistance, let them down," according to the official document, which was seen by TIME magazine, but which has not been released to local media outlets.
Jeremiah Kayam, 56, the elder of the town of Kego Koto in Enarotali, felt a threatening threat and called on the people to remain at peace, asking them to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
“When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left bank,” he told TIME magazine in his bright colors on the balcony of the treehouse.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but says the moon came from the ranks of assembled soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, a lot of revenge," he added.
The local man, Alfius Youw, was shot three times, according to the cousin.
“I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” said John, who uses only one name in the case of many Indonesians.
"I see he's dead... I kissed him."
Papuan Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only returned the security of their department because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if we are threatened with murder," Pudjo Sulistiyo, a Papuan police spokesman, said in 2015.
“It is a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the killings reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses committed in the Papacy.
“I want to solve this case right away so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was establishing an out-of-court mechanism to address crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately there was an apology.
"Most of the crimes took place a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we need to follow a certain process," he said.
Speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, however, Wiranto took back his words, saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “everything is settled by law.”
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the 1999 blood independence referendum, said 11 crimes against human rights had already been resolved in Papua, including in Pania.
The families of the victims of the panic accepted such claims with a deep sigh.
“I’ve been overheard four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made,” John said.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Pania are afraid of this incident altogether.
He said he was beaten by the military after he had helped kill four victims.
“After burying the bodies, the military came to look for me,” he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on visitors to the Paniai neighborhood of Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, when a spokesman went on to speak to the head of the construction company, who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This mastermind, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to police, the villagers looted the policemen with stones, after which the latter responded with warning shots.
But according to local claims, the mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
“We were in a great panic, we fear revenge,” 29-year-old Domingu Badi, who lives near the hospital, told TIME magazine.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the police to take responsibility for the matter and withdraw the police mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a problematic place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of deliberate development feeds on the discontent of the honey, many, Danish and Damal tribes living in the arid Middle East of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papuan Movement (VPL) rebel army, which, according to itself, protects the rights of the Papuans, organizing random attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL’s predecessors are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, Paniai has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of people on the pretext of "defending state sovereignty" in recent years.
Some of them never show up again.
Among the priests, Paniai is known as a “tragic forgotten place”.
Poverty feeds on dissatisfaction.
A small amount of rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive for locals to buy.
The bread is the same.
People grow all their food on their own mainly with potatoes, in addition to a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five generations of potatoes.
They usually keep most of the proceeds for the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten botats cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic disparity between the original papayas and the new migrants, who have been horrified by the opening of new air lines at Nabire Airport, has deepened.
These few jobs that exist go to better educated and richer migrants.
Priests themselves often do not have the necessary skills or capital to run a competitive business.
“Young people are not interested in staying here because there are no jobs or money,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Separation keeps the eyes of the world away from the papacy.
In addition, strict restrictions on external media remain.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp were sent out of Papua because "they did not follow appropriate practices", although they were given a rare film license.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy head of Human Rights Watch’s Asia department, Jokowi’s election promises to lose transparency and development restrictions imposed on reporters have not been implemented.
"In Indonesia, Papua's most eastern provinces and Western Papua's reportage to try to make journalists face new threats of visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a sweeping look at journalism means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the neighboring factories of Papua.
In March, the six Pacific states of Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands encouraged the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "various wide-ranging crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Pania.
These countries have also historically supported the VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, dismissed the group's accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still democratic order and freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover up evidence of anti-human rights cases."
Local people want more attention from the governments of foreign countries.
When the official delegation of the Netherlands headed the country’s human rights envoy Kees Van Barar visited Jayapura on May 4, local people interrupted the meeting who had attended but wanted to remain anonymous, according to a source who said they wanted to remain silent, demanding: “We want freedom.”
Indonesia will hold a new presidential election in 2019, but the priests do not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of Paniai," Hobai, chairman of the tribal council, said in a statement.
He wants to make it clear to Jokow that, in addition to the fact that Paniai people are constantly living under the threat of a vicious army, they are suffering from poverty due to the education and health services of the Nigeriens.
According to Gobai, the people of Pania, like the other priests, owe their voice to Jokow, which he must pay.
“They don’t need money, they want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of Paniai’s shooting victims were able to deal with yet another symbolic counter-attack they buried one of the victims’ bodies on the ground opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be set in motion, at least they will not let the perpetrators forget their crimes.
“One of our family members was killed,” Yacobus says with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
It was the second time that the Dubai Torch has fallen.
Fire swept through one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from its 337-metre-high and 79-story buildings.
This is the second fire that has destroyed a high-rise building in just two years, known as the Torch, or Torque Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no direct cause of fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up to a fire alarm and people shouting.
We would run down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident who called himself George told Reuters.
According to Dubai Civil Protection officials, firefighters extinguished the flames at around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident could again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the exterior of high-rise buildings around the world.
During the investigation conducted by the Torch Board after the 2015 fire, it was found that the most damage was suffered by facade tiles - decorative panels on the exterior and insulation.
UK police have said they believe the isolation of London’s Grenfell Tower and the facade panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire that occurred there in June, killing about 80 people.
See: These phones are likely to be sold in the autumn
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, as then the phone manufacturers will announce their new top models.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came on sale, and in the fall, new hit phones are also expected for retailers.
According to Kristjan Seema, Tele2’s marketing and sales director, this year’s flagship features an innovative design, an eye-catching scanner, a 4K edge-to-edge display and ultra-thin processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also arrived at the front of the Estonian smartphone sales chart, was very exciting in the technological world.
In the autumn, the smartwatches will be even more responsive to fast charging, a more durable battery, a higher quality camera and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that on the basis of the rumors, it is already possible to make assumptions and predict four top models, which are likely to dominate sales charts this year.
These top four smartphone models will be available to retailers in the fall of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to hit the shelves by mid-September.
There’s a lot of rumors about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done about it.
If the iPhone 7 didn’t make a significant difference next to the iPhone 6s, Apple’s tenth birthday is expected to be completely different from the previous model.
There are four colors spoken: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One element of the new design is probably the screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is lost and the fingerprint sensor is built into the screen.
Apple’s head of design, JonyIve, wants the new iPhone model to look like a smooth glass.
There was also a ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to an eye-catching scanner, wireless charging and an even higher quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
This is one of the most anticipated smartphones of the year.
The launch of the Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23.
There are a lot of rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
Hearingly, it’s designed for even more business users, and the S Pen allows for even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is a rectangle and the other a narrower field of view telephoto lens.
Currently, no one knows what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung’s first test, which is certainly comparable in quality to the iPhone 8.
We will be waiting until August 23rd.
While Nokia has launched three smartphones this year ahead of the Nokia 6, there is still a shortage of their flagship, the Nokia 8, which will be unveiled on August 16.
We’re waiting for Nokia’s 5.3-inch edge-to-edge display and ultra-thin Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and more durable battery.
For Nokia, there is also talk of aluminum housing and a significant level of water and dust resistance IP68.
Similar to Samsung, Nokia’s new model has two rear cameras, which are manufactured by Zeiss.
While Sony’s solid flagship has so far been XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones with even more innovative features will be added in the near future.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
Sony's new model is speculated to be at least six-inch.
What brings reality, we can already see the right head, because traditionally, Sony has unveiled its autumn flagship at an international technology fair IFA, which will take place this year from September 1st to 6th.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post published transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and heads of state of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump telephoned Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to end the public announcement that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The US president slammed the wall with him for public condemnation, saying, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump has made a promise to build a wall along the U.S. southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing a tense exchange of ideas.
Trump told Turnbull that the deal, according to which the U.S. is taking on refugees heading to Australia, is "terrible", "neighborly" and "comfortable". He claimed that the deal made during Obama's administration would leave him with a "judgmental" look, as he
Trump ended the speech, noting to Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant speech of the day.”
The Riigikogu did not take into consideration the complaint of O<0xC3><0x9C> MRP Linadi in the case where the city of Tartu rejected their offer for bus transport from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a decree rejecting the offer of O<0xC3><0x9C> MRP City Lines on the Tartu bus station, as the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, head of the Tartu City Law Service.
This is a public bus transport project in the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The MRP City Lines appealed to the Riigikogu against the decision of the Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not take this action.
While many on social media complain that the noise from the weekend festival disturbs them at night and the whole city is drunk with parties, there are also many who don’t have a bad word about the beach festival.
I am even positively surprised that the parties in the store were so polite!
I didn't see any confusion or inconsistency.
“I’ve even seen the light,” Laine said.
“It’s nice to come, be and feel the joy of P<0xC3><0xA4>rnu, who has been left as winter leaves,” he adds cheerfully.
The beach smells of a tiny wave and does not disturb.
While living in the city centre, he still heard that music is being played on the beach, so now the music has not yet reached his home country.
"But I hope I hear," he says cheerfully.
Agnes, who also spoke with the evening newspaper, says that the big festival is better for P<0xC3><0xA4>rnu - it really helps the local merchants to get around.
He is also pleased that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
A woman's voice doesn't mix.
I don't want to go to the beach anymore, but I'm glad the beach is alive.
And it’s good that the people are moving and it’s been like that three times already,” she says.
For the first time, it must have been a little worse.
“There may have been complaints,” he said.
However, it is the noise at the beach that he says is common for summer residents.
“This weekend is a very good promo for our small town,” says the park’s mesmerizing Harri.
The noise and the fog didn't blow his life's rhythm.
What about what?!
We should all keep together.
Think about how this inter-ethnic communication would be better.
The sound of the music doesn't fade.
It doesn't matter, even though I live nearby.
“Good people can keep together and there’s no harm,” he says.
According to him, the guests who come to P<0xC3><0xA4>rnu are polite.
“With the bottles, of course, they’re a little exaggerated too, but young people are young and kind to God – let’s go, but be human and we can do it!” he says.
By this time, the coastal inhabitants have travelled far away, whether to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like such noise," says Tiina, who walked with children in P<0xC3><0xA4>rnus.
His family’s und festival music also doesn’t bother, although last year it was even further away from the street.
Last summer, the stage was different, so we heard more.
We live outside the city itself, which is actually quite well nestled far from the P<0xC3><0xA4>rnu river,” he says.
Pearson slashes 3,000 more jobs and cuts dividends to revive business
British education company Pearson said on Friday it would cut 3,000 more jobs and cut its middle-income by 72 percent, launching a new restructuring programme to address the business’s looming slump.
The jobs to be lost, which will be amassed, according to Executive Director John Fallon, are likely to be added to the 4,000 jobs lost during the previous restructuring at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019.
In May, Pearson announced plans to cut costs by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million (US$394 million) as part of a third cost-cutting program to try to revive a business that has been hit by a rapid digital learning transition.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann last month, said their expectations for the year had not changed after a 1-percent increase in sales revenue was reported in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.

Konvoirunt in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked military convoys in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
The NATO statement said five soldiers and a translator had been injured.
According to local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Herat mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
The NATO statement said that a Thursday night explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked "with a man carrying a self-made explosive device".
According to the statement, all are injured in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to the correspondents, the Taliban and the group, known as the Islamic State (ISIS), are always a serious source of concern for the forces in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people mainly in the Shiite district.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
More than 150 people were killed in a major bomb attack in the central city on May 31 – the deadliest military attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban in 2001.
This violence underscores the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the country’s military and police.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also brought a public crisis of confidence against the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA cleared the application for a decision to postpone the court order
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annulled the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama Provisional Regulation, which obliges states to limit the emissions caused by storms, one day after 15 states complained to the agency about this incident.
The EPA announced the decision to continue the "2015 a ozone-depleting operations" late Wednesday, saying it demonstrates the agency's commitment to cooperation with the states.
“We believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our partner states and listen to them,” EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt had announced the EPA’s intention to postpone ozone determinations, which measure air pollution in different parts of the country to determine where this level should be reduced by one year to meet the stricter air quality standard by October 2018.
The 15 main democratic states filed an action together with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
President Donald Trump’s government has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama. According to Trump, this is part of a broader economic growth marketing plan.
But these efforts have created counter-reactions among democrats and nature conservation groups who have raised concerns about the impact of pollutants on human health.
According to the EPA website, breathing in ozone-containing air “can reduce lung function and increase the risk of developing respiratory disease,” for example, in asthma.
German pigs can come to a party.
Germany’s pigs and cattle can come to a party as heavy rain threatens the EU’s second-largest wheat crop, Bloomberg writes.
This year, it can be said that the weeks of harvest may mean that the fruit intended for the bakery industry is only suitable for animals to eat.
“The quality of wheat is far worse than the soil and poorer than in 2015,” said Bernhard Chilla, an analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can go to animal feed, which is twice as common, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, as well as their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
At first, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June replaced the hot springs.
In July, Germany struck a flood plain, which has also continued into August.
Many eyes have been turned to northern Germany, where the rain is preventing harvests.
So far, only five percent of wheat has been harvested.
The harvest has not yet started in the majority of the area, local harvest collector Ceravis reported.
“There are really difficult days in the month,” said Frank Decker, a senior trader at Ceravi’s, from Rendsburg.
Consistent with everything, i.e. Finnish interior design schemes sparks
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the brasseries, because through large windows, the views of the expensive Saimaa reach many (living) rooms.
At every step, the eyes of our North Africans will begin to strive to create at the same time both fragile and perfect (energy-efficient) homes.
The ability to use Finnish wood as building and finishing materials, furniture and beauty products is also worth the admiration and respect.
Flexible solutions and smart solutions can be found in the fairgrounds by both the builder and the (home) designer.
It is obvious that the composition of black, white and gray shadows, when supplemented by wood tones and room effects, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be rushed for another week, because the fair will last until August 13.
Supplies and utensils suggest that this kitchen is often cooked in the kitchen.
Tonight, a line was drawn down to this year’s Weekend Festival Baltic, and Martin Garrix did everything he could to be remembered as the last performer.
The people were really turning around during Garrix's performance - singing, shouting, dancing presumptuously.
When Garrix was finished, the mass of a common mass was spread from the beach of P<0xC3><0xA4>rnu to the city.
We'll bring you a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer tried on the weekend in three days.
You must be one of them too, find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible opposition
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be on a collision course to compete in the fastest-growing boxing match of the near future up to 66.7 kg in the weight category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN’s Los Angeles office until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked the other end of the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization’s closing weight champion.
Following Garcia's unanimous decision, the victory over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime is a prelude to the weight table.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How are you doing, champ?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marria at 7 p.m. on Saturday night at ESPN.
When posing for a couple of photos, Lomachenko’s mayor Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be a “perfect measurement”.
"I'm a former locksmith," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up [to 63.5 kg] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm 63.5 pounds small.
I want to move down a light weight.
And he has to move up the light weight [61,2 kg] and then we can fight.
Fans have wanted it.
Let’s offer them that.”
Lomachenko agreed.
"The world of Pox needs this fight."
The climate of the climate raised the question of whether to watch it should be paid. This is part of his strategy, according to which he wants to let Lomachenkol debut at the end of this year in a 61.2 kg class to make a possible next summer meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 nokauts) in Forge on the grass on the grass on the grass on the grass, or on the grass on the grass on the grass on the grass
“Watching this fight could be rewarding because the fans have wanted it to stand up,” Garcia said, later saying that she is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
“We are the main actors.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a "strong fighter" and could go watch his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in thanking Garcia, saying that he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted it dead."
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the impact strength and then to knock.
Both confirmed that they feel the tension between them is growing to be a test of wealth.
“It’s a struggle that awaits realization.
No other opponent will cause so much attention and summation.
I’m more than willing to work for it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I’ve been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It's going to be a good fight."
Which of the world’s giants are moving to Estonia?
Mullu has extended and issued more than 13,000 residence permits to third-country nationals who have travelled to Estonia for work, study or family on a record basis.
When, for example, a temporary residence permit was decided to issue 6702 to a foreigner, the number of tons was 4928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis is being prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
When about 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ten years ago, in recent years this number will reach close to 2,000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased by leaps and bounds during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014, 1087 people were granted temporary residence permits, 675 a year earlier.
According to the Statistics Agency, the number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia is growing the most - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than they left.
“The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia and due to difficult situations in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many people are already in front of the family,” said Kristin Rammus, press secretary of the Interior Ministry.
The number of Ukrainians who were granted a temporary residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although over the course of ten years the most permanent residence permits have been issued to the last.
If the Ukrainians come here to work, then the citizens of Russia for family reasons.
“Given this historical Russian community, they are also likely to have the largest family ties with the people living in Russia,” said Helina Maasing, a migration scientist at the Academy of Internal Defense.
"When you look at where the citizens of Estonia who have been granted a residence permit have moved to, then after Harjumaa there is Ida-Virumaa," he added, adding that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Mullu received a temporary residence permit in 1696 as a Russian citizen, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians wishing to extend residence permits decreased.
“The reason for this is that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been requested for permanent residence in Estonia,” said Rammus, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, who said the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia’s residence permit has remained stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia from the previous year.
Its purpose is to encourage people to come here.
A long-term resident’s residence permit, for example, requires five years.
Due to the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit is also likely to be reduced.
For example, the soil was given such a residence permit to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now Ukrainians can change jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be able to keep track of whether the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit became quite popular - applicants still had grey passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, people living in Estonia were granted a residence permit in 1968, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
Over the past ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
In 2007, when three residence permits were issued to Nigerians, 200 were issued.
You'll come from Nigeria to study at the local universities.
Furthermore, Estonian high schools are popular with Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased substantially thanks to apprenticeships.
They also have the rule that where the community has arisen, it is easier to come to others,” Rammus added.
For ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If a residence permit is granted to about 6,000 third-country nationals a year, it is about 0.46% of the total population.
Even if you add citizens of the European Union, the migration remains at about a percentage point," Maasing said, adding that the numbers are actually small.
According to statistics, 14,822 people migrated to Estonia, while 13,792 people migrated to Estonia.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of export.
The majority of expatriates and immigrants are Estonian citizens, but more are among those who leave.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was at a disadvantage with 2000 people.
Estonians, in particular, travel the difference between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's Princess Style Is Enthralled With Bats, Tikants, and Tulle
However, for Maria Tammeoru, there is a history of old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours in a museum somewhere and admire ancient gloves and scratches.
When you do something with passion, you study and learn about it every day.
It's a pleasure to discover!
Mammu Couture’s glamorous world may seem to some to lifeline, but the designer doesn’t think so.
You decide how much light you have in your life.
I have a friend who has a whole sauna full of my created haute couture dresses.
Because neither is it his fault that he doesn’t live in Hollywood and doesn’t go to the red carpet every day, he also wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and wear them!
You can make your life special!
The fashion artist does not recognize the gap between the bright events and the gray everyday.
It was this thought process that led to a plan to bring high fashion in Estonia to the ends of the earth, between forests and fields, to people whose fashion often does not reach.
For example, the Mammu collection was presented on the V<0xC3><0xB5>rus, J<0xC3><0xB5>hvis and P<0xC3><0xA4>rnu fashion show, where a royal parade with 45 models filled the entire street.
In Tallinn, a shop is often taken in, it is noted with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - shout bravely, rise up, want to thank you hand in hand.
A large part of the audience had to renew, but now they are fans of Mammu Couture.
When you exceed people's expectations, they're spirited!
And I like the feeling that I'm in the summer with my modeling.
In P<0xC3><0xA4>rnu we had a 50-meter-long red carpet, full of beautiful street dresses, it seemed that they would not come to an end!
Maria also does not admit that the creation must be presented by a super-salt supermodel, she will gladly bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they have always come with pleasure.
It's such a fun experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I’m so sorry that I’ve never seen my performance myself, I’m always behind the scenes to give things as hopeless perfectionist the last straw.
My nerves wouldn't let me look at the sage.
Mary is this kind of fashion designer who wants to not only perform the role of representation, but to be in everything in hand.
I have my sewing machine in the studio, I make most of the collection myself.
I like the whole process, where you play with details, you discover.
I'm never far from my work and I'm not afraid of work.
The design is not limited to stylistics, logistics, organizing, organizing - everything must fall apart on the day of a single temperamental woman.
Those hours of work are going to be huge for fans.
I can’t tell when my work day ends, for me it’s just a day full of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an incessant happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and in turn compliments.
Several times it has been said that my dresses have magic - they make you feel like a princess.
The captivating tangles of satire that made Maria famous all night long have remained as a signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin M<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xBC>rsepp U18 from the boys: the Estonian underground tournament gun was now turned against us
I'm sorry, the legacy is over.
The first thing I noticed was that we couldn’t get our table.
And if there’s such a big difference in the table, there’s nothing to do,” commented Estonian U18 basketball coach Martin M<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xBC>rsepp, our only NBA player, down 61:75.
Opponents took 28 balls from the attack table and got so many more attacks as a result.
We were also not prepared for their aggressive defense or attack, it created.
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up protection.
In defense, however, they managed to keep their hands between each other, we could not combine.
That's what got the team under their feet.
The housework was better done.
According to M<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xBC>rsep, Estonia would have to make more tactical mistakes in order to take down the high ranks of opponents.
In the last quarter - we had a zero error, but the opponents have already received several quick baskets.
The athleticism and the tight finish, which was in the underground tournament with our gun, now turned all against us.
Today we did not have the strength against their aggression.
M<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xBC>rsepp stayed at peace with his caretaker Kalevis, Matthias Tassi.
In the tournament in general, you can say good words about the whole team, until today there was a common beat in the music.
It is a pity that the victims of such an aggressive opponent have already met before.
The cup has always been self-confident and played its way out today, but it seemed that she was tired - she has been carrying quite a big load.
But he made some very beautiful moves that I’ve seen in training before,” added the instructor.
Terrifying numbers: Women's basketball team threw less than 10 points in three-quarters of the...
In the U18 age group, not only is the young men's EMI B-division basketball tournament in Tallinn, the girls started all over Dublin.
And the Estonian game with Poland was a good one in the field of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter it was 9:49 or only in the last ten minutes, opponents took their feet off the gas pedal and that period was 16:16.
In both the first and second quarter, Estonia scored 4 points in the third...
In the first two minutes of the first four games, the Estonians hit two pieces, then 25 pieces from the game, then one third in, and then 21 more points in...
In about half an hour, one of the 47 bugs was killed.
In addition, there were two points out of four free throws.
The loss was a reasonable number at the time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland lost 33 per cent and Estonia 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, on the opening day we had to recognise the best of Portugal 83:56.
NATO ships have come to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO’s 1st permanent mine action group arrived for a planned port visit to Tallinn for the weekend to supplement the ship’s reserves and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships make preparations to return to the sea and give crew members the opportunity to take a couple of days off.
After the visit, NATO ships will stay in Estonian waters to conduct several exercises and be ready for future search operations for historical explosives.
“Estonians’ participation in the NATO unit and the co-operation training conducted by them in the local waters well reflects our integration with the Allied forces,” said Major General Arto Reinmaa, Chief of Operations and Planning Department of the Navy.
Starting from June 29, NATO’s 1st permanent minesweeper group will be headed by Lt. Gen. Gvido Laudups, who took over the duties of the group’s commander-in-chief, Lt. Gen. Johan-Elias Seljama, at the ceremony held in Riga.
The group’s flagship is the Latvian Navy’s support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates as the group’s flagship.
This half-year also includes the composition of the international unit of the Estonian Navy miner Sakala.
One of the four vessels under NATO’s naval command is the NATO 1st permanent mini-attack group, one of the primary fast responders, which the alliance can send to various parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, Pirita Monastery’s ancient treasures will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, which was inaugurated 13 years ago by Maestro Eri Klasi, is held.
This year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to Risto Joosti, artistic director of the Tallinn Philharmonic.
Risto Joost: Listeners reach into the classics of the opera world include "Traviata" and "Tosca", ballet responses from the enchanting "Bolerost" to the fun "Karlsson" and also does not lack the plan of its own production, which in this case is the wonderful oratorium of Joseph Haydn's "The Years of the Year"
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It’s a festival that’s going to take power and never really open up again.
For the experience that the listener receives in this lofty and mysterious environment makes the human senses louder and touches the human challenges in a way that cannot be described.
You are the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't Maestro Eri Klasi's shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klass, it has been a lot of help.
He directed me throughout my student career and also supported me at the beginning of my management career.
Maybe it’s because of that that that makes it easier for me to continue my work.
“Eri Klas has injected so much good into the Birgitta Festival team and of course it’s all over me.
It was great to join a team that knew exactly how things were going.
Just the big heart of Eri Klas also gave me strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What could excite the audience at this year’s festival, what do you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, the first ballet written for Astrid Lindgren’s story will be presented in the museum.
That's "Karlsson is flying."
And one curious nuance at this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed a desire to write this work.
He probably already had Karlsson’s character in his childhood.
Cross, how can you do all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner, of course.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have that.
And I’ve noticed that my personal emotions don’t depend as much on other people as I do on myself, or how I react to each new day.
And such a conscious holding of tone, keeping of positivity and actually smiling at yourself in the morning mirror, significantly increased my percentage of happiness.
Especially now this week, when there are the most important tests, I have practiced it especially agarally and it works.
Laughter activates the brain and increases the tone.
It's not just a word.
I don’t think people know half the things about their body that the universe offers them, but everyone discovers it gradually.
Right now, it's an important moment.
Do you have any rituals before you step on the conductor's desk?
You have to change clothes to be more comfortable.
It's this little moment for yourself.
But in general yes, I have no chance to rest before a big show or make a little sleepover.
In fact, I even like to actively communicate with people, even before the entry of the conductor desk.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, here is something to discover also not only for a great opera and ballet friend!
Watch the mood videos with Risto Joost!
New results of Swedish asylum-seekers’ age assessment tests published
In Sweden, a test was conducted among asylum seekers, during which their age was assessed with a new medical approach. The most recent results of the test show that more than 80 percent of the tests were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Judicial Medicine (R<0xC3><0xA4>ttsmedicinalverket) started testing towards the beginning of this year.
The tests were created to assess the age of asylum more accurately after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to correctly determine the age of several allegedly underage refugees.
To date, the Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases for testing and the Institute of Judiciary has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid-March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 years of age or older, and for another 25 cases, the Institute of Judicial Medicine assessed that the tester "may be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person is “probably younger than 18”.
Tests are used only if the age of the person is under the question mark.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson, who works at the Institute of Judiciary Medicine, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
“We don’t see a big difference compared to the previous months’ statistics, the numbers are pretty consistent,” he told The Local newspaper.
The fact that most of the cases were assessed above 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum-seekers have lied about their age.
The institute released the results of 581 tests in May and said that in 442 cases "there are indications that the person being investigated is 18 years of age or older".
But when Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of their 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases a person had directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This method of evaluation of medical age, in the course of which X-rays of wisdom teeth and cervical MRI are performed, after which they are analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose work assignments include assessing people’s biological maturity to find out if they went through puberty sooner or later.
“I’ve had reason to think about it and I don’t think the measurement method that’s currently in use should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say for sure, then we shouldn’t make a face that we can,” he told Metro.
But Johan G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson, from the Institute of Judiciary Medicine, defended the accuracy of the tests: "Overall, it can be said that the risk of improperly adultating a child is low.
The highest, or about 10%, is the risk if the person is a little under 18.”

20-year-old summer publisher Anna Maria Orel made her London MMil beautiful debut, earning a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was the youngest female emigrant in the world, and a joyful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The race went well and I had a good experience.
With the first test (64.80) I immediately took my average result, the second (62.80) I risked too much and the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," Orel said after the race.
I've been looking for my stuff and I'm glad I found it.
Anna Maria Oreli’s MMI debut ended in a good 18th place.
He didn’t mix the rain with Orel, because he’s training through the winter at TTU Stadium.
“I’m tired,” he said with a small voice.
At the London Olympic Stadium, there was almost a full house division of the people, did Orel feel the people around him or was able to turn himself off?
I realized, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it adds up – so it is!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will remain at peace with the MMI debut and is still waiting for a lot of good competitions: "I came here with the 32nd or last result of this season, I finished in 18th place.
This is a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and MMil - that's the only thing that counts.
I have a lot of experience and some days I want to compete for medals.
West Virginia's governor announced the party's
West Virginia Democratic Gov. Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening at a meeting with President Trump that he would change parties.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I am telling you, having prayed and thought about it a lot... today I am telling you, the West Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
The gathering was filled with joys.
"So tomorrow I'll be a Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to play another game."
Trump had previously made a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Trump won by 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, turned out to be elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns stone quarrying in five states, and he owns a stone quarry from his father.
Its value is about 1.59 billion dollars.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that "Cuberner Justice's party exchange is another blow to the Democratic Party, which would rather prevent the country from becoming better again than working for it."
"Only 15 governor seats and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest move to a party that is ultimately unguided and unable to find a positive and unifying message," Ronna McDani, RNC's president, said in a statement.
It is no surprise that where there are many people, there are also many injured.
Urmet, who works in a medical practice at the weekend, told the Evening Post that they had to distribute the patches quite a lot.
The curls and curls are basic, out-swimming and slight falls.
Head, back and foot pain, of course.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with false demands and so problems come.
The medics have also had to help a few more injured visitors - there have been some panic attacks and also one foot injury.
We’ve also done stitches when a person has broken his hand or finger.
We're gonna make smaller cuts here, we're gonna send bigger ones to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if the painkillers are also asking about the festive medicines for the treatment of pimples.
Coe Apologizes to Russians for Doping Scandal
Sebastian Coe, the international head of the lighthouse, praised Russia's "honest apology for Thursday's" doping scandal, but said it was not time to allow the country to return to the sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, the Russian lighthouse’s nickname, told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the lighthouse’s World Championships that the ban on competition imposed on his country is right and has a definite goal to fight doping.
He apologised "to all the light-armsmen who have been knocked out of the competition by the gold and silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to put into effect a competition ban, which was introduced in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-backed doping in Russia.
“I think today was a very honest response, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The Health Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Permanent Union also admitted to itself that they have had quite difficult times and they are doing everything possible to reorganize the Permanent Union."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for self-prevention.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but Congress supports the working group's proposal that now is not the right time to withdraw from Russia," Coe said.
“We need to do everything possible in the next couple of months to normalize the situation.
We have always taken the principle that we want to separate pure athletes from the broken system," he added.
Nineteen Russian light-armoured wrestlers who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF will compete as neutral athletes in the light-armed world championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia had not yet met several precautionary criteria.
Following a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told reporters in London that the doping control is still insufficient and the banned coaches are still operating freely.
The revolution in electric cars significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only does the electric car revolution significantly transform everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers on the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say that they win and lose from one place to another, smaller mining firms don’t help.
Currently, Glencore earns from coal and oil, but in the era of electric cars, cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel demand continue to grow.
This year, the United Kingdom, France and Norway have increased their share of electric cars, which will allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades.
Sestap has already announced that they plan to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring a cheaper Model 3 electric car to market.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, electric cars have been sold for more than two decades in cars that use fuel produced from oil.
“With some metals, it changes everything,” Simona Gambranini, a raw material analyst at Capital Economics, told Bloomberg.
We have already seen a huge impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has grown for years.
Electric cars are about three times more copper than conventional cars, Glencore reported.
Even more copper is needed in charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates it will increase copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will be able to profit from the growing trend of electric cars from a bearish price increase and from being the world’s largest cobalt producer, the Jefferies Group forecasts.
According to this brokerage firm, the winners of the electric cars are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already reacting to a changing trend.
This year, 70 percent of the London Metal Exchange’s cobalt price has gone up.
The price increase was 37%.
This year, copper also accounted for 14 percent, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore’s shares rose 20 percent in London, surpassing rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the side of the losers are lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine, which need to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of the plug is the power-supplying batteries for petrol and diesel starters.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
“This is a serious risk to the demand for steel, except where other purposes are found to overcome the decrease in demand,” said Michael Widmer, chief analyst at Merrill Lynch, a metal market analyst at the Bank of America.
With the price movement of Plii, there is still no effect of the unfolding trend.
This year, the lead has been valued at 17 per cent, with London being among the top industrial metals in terms of price increase.
Investors will only see problems with metal in the distant future.
"I'm not sure it's so bad for the plug, because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars in competition," said Triland Metals sales manager Herwig Schmidt.
When the demand for lead falls, it occurs slowly.
This could happen in about 10 years.
However, the stricter emission standards so far mean that the demand for hybrid cars, depending on the lead-based batteries developed when starting engines, is increasing, according to the international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals such as aluminum replace steel, because a lighter car can drive away with less electricity.
This explains an additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminium minimum requirements as of 2013-2016.
It accounts for 2.7% of the world’s aluminium production.
This trend is likely to deepen, Widmer said.
This year, aluminium has been valued at 13 percent, as the growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
The producers aren't sleeping.
AK Steel Holding cooperates with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce amazing car wheels.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy steel to resist aluminum alloys.
“Overstrength steel should be the answer to this development,” said Sylvain Brunet, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.
We see some success in Europe.
The end of the oil season can also bring suffering to the platinum.
Mullu spent about half of that precious metal diesel engine on car catalysts, said metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
“Many of today’s high-demand raw materials, such as oil and platinum, may not be in high demand in the future,” said Bernard Dahdah, a raw material analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will become more important within 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe in the continued demand for diesel-hybrid cars.
Uncore CEO Marc Grynberg said that by 2025, more hybrid cars will continue to be sold than full-electric cars.
The big hope of platinum manufacturers in the 10-year perspective is that Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos are developed on hydrogen-powered cars that rely on platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
However, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
“Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars,” said Brunet, a BNP Paribasist.
German automakers took part in a major setback in July as a court in Stuttgart banned the use of diesel in the home cities of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football’s financial rules affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules, aimed at preventing the unregulated use of European football clubs, do not prevent Neymar from making a world record move from the Spanish football club Barcelona France to the club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, a governing body that rules the European game and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, are just waiting for Paris Saint-Germain.
UEFA’s 2011 Fair Play Financial Rules (FFP) means that PSG must at any time prove that Neymar’s transition was funded without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros ($262 million) alone for the Brazilian to buy out of his contract, and Neymar’s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of Neymar’s financial aspects of moving to a French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to raise money for the recruitment of Neymar and for the addition of such funds to its star-studded lineup, given that the team is funded by the family that runs the energy crisis in Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot to recruit players, but they must balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out with their own in the football business.
The FFP was founded by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into great debt in search of success are actually dealing with fraud and risk being dumped if banks or owners were to give up support.
Since 2011, the FFP has focused on monitoring these losses rather than on the debts of clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 at Chelsea – buying a potential club and then making big expenses to make the team better and creating a global brand – is harder to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period, which runs until 2018, the clubs may suffer losses of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini was ousted from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules further," Andrea Traverso, a UEFA FFP observer, told The Associated Press last week.
While PSG paid Neymar for the acquisition clause as a single full-time payment, they are able to allocate this amount for accounting purposes to the parties throughout the term of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, which makes it possible to show the transfer fee in the amount of EUR 44.4 million per year for the next five years.
In the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, together with Abu Dhabi’s Manchester City, received the most severe penalties.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (currently <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>82 million), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and the club was asked to limit the Champions League team to 21 players for the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to circumvent regulatory financial institutions by talking their incomes up through companies that are associated with the club’s owners.
While the Qatari company may sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered an official income.
This was the case in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of the support from the Qatar Tourism Authority PSG was inflated.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymari’s PSG service could come from Qatar through payments from the 2022 World Cup Organising Committee.
However, PSG and Qatar in 2022 deny that Neymar could be the source of the World Cup, and argue that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant with regard to any attempts to circumvent the rules.
People familiar with the incident said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed Neymar’s transition with PSG in advance.
They spoke with The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is guaranteed as they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The most recent published reports show that PSG earned more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million in revenue during the 2015-2016 season with turnover of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>542.4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar’s arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship deals, sales and shirt sales.
With regard to the conclusion of the contract, the club expects an increase of at least 30 per cent in turnover.
The Spanish league, clearly annoyed by the departure of one of the biggest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar's transition, claiming that PSG was violating the FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'money doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG belongs mainly to Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports giant, shares La Liga’s warning that the country is funding the club.
"This is a consequence of property rights and has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“If the club belongs to the country, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of an honest game, because the state may have other ways or interests to represent such a great player to the country."

Today 50 years ago: a hurricane-sized storm in Estonia that ripped roofs and windows from houses.
The storm of the century, which struck on 6 and 7 August, caused great damage, especially to the West, Harjumaa and Raplamaa.
During those days, the wind speed in Loode-Estonia was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one map tree to another in the garden and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was dark and dark, like the end of the world.
The roofs were already flying from the houses, recalled Linda Kurova Haapsalu in an interview with Estonian Nature magazine in 2002.
Linda’s husband saw her own planted garden in the mud.
But what do you support trees with your hands where you can withstand such a storm?
The sea came under the window, the windows pressed into the water,” said Mrs Linda Tona, who lived on the street in Haapsalu Kalda.
The fact that the road was full of trees and the roof of the railway station's perron had flown 20-30 meters away, Linda, like most oxygen survivors, only saw it the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were dug in the ground, some quite long, some in half.
Everything looked very mesmerizing, the storm passed through beautiful old trees like a ravine and a ravine like a war.
West Virumaa was not able to suffer particularly badly in August 1967 compared to West Estonia, but the losses there were also great, Virumaa wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padise Park were celebrated from the ground up, but also our Bear Parks were able to suffer greatly.
In Tallinn, the wind speed was measured up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
On the evening of 6 August in Tallinn, a little beggar called out: "Mother, mother!
The chickens are in the air and can’t sign anymore!” wrote the Virumaa Announcer.
The P<0xC3><0xB5>ll manor building in Viljandi was destroyed during the storm so that it was decided to dismantle it later.
The Augustitorm was not opposed to the constructions of the T<0xC3><0xBC>r ski jump, which were not later restored.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star magazine wrote that the cleaning of cities and settlements from decayed trees and their branches is progressing slowly, and residents could be involved in the cleaning work.
The storm also had a strong impact on the crops, and the newspaper reported that "partisan organizations must be both in the process of organizing and in the process of fruit harvesting as an incentive and a guide".
Hurricanes can be talked about if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The wind record in Estonia lasts from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul was measured at a speed of 48 m/s.
On the island of Vaindloo, a meter collapsed, so the measured strong wind speed could not be accurately recorded.
The Secret of Pure Soup Beaches: Nightly Decorating and Bad Beaches
The colder summers also mean a smaller cleaning area on Tallinn’s sunny beaches.
“When there is no air, people are on the beach, and if there is no, there are no people,” says the beach cleaner.
On the shores of North Tallinn Stroomi, the kayaks are sizzling.
They are offered melodic competition on low turns of the tractor, which bends down the strip on the beach.
In fact, the last seven centimetres of sand sweeps through the sand, removing the debris from the sea and the debris left behind by people: bottlenecks, cigarette cans and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
When there is beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if there is no, there are no people,” says Aleksandr Usov, head of beach cleaning at Haabersti.
At 6:30 p.m., the beach is full of nice decorations, because at 8 a.m. the place should be fine for people.
Usov's on the job already at 4:00.
Besides Stroomi, he keeps an eye on Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakum<0xC3><0xA4>e and Paljasaare Pikakari beach.
The amount of rubbish has decreased.
Years ago, it was much more.
People are already able to appreciate what is being done for them,” says Usov, who has been cleaning the beach for 15 years.
Before, when something new was put up, it was already broken the next day.
What's on the beach is now being kept.
Pure Beach Price
One of the biggest works on the Estonian coast is the cleaning of the sea debris, or adder, that is, threatened on the shore.
For example, in Pirita beach, 400 000 tonnes must be extracted after the beach season.
“It’s an incredible amount,” Usov says.
The second big category is the olfactory waste, which is all that people leave behind.
The half-kilometre-long Stroomi beach has eight large garbage containers, which need to be emptied three times a week.
There's so much shit going on.
However, colder summers have meant that the litter is one-fifth less than otherwise.
The third category consists of things that are left behind.
These are mostly children's toys.
This time around, a dozen model cars were hauled out of the sand by Usov.
They remain owners waiting for the beach to be laid out.
"Usually they come out more, but that's a normal catch." Usov already knows that he'll soon find them again in the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to put them back in the sand.
The garbage is spread out
Erika Scholler, representative of Haaberst’s administrative services, admits that the tractor’s handling work disturbs the locals.
The noise, which lasts from night to early morning, confuses the sleep of people living nearby.
Today, however, this work is impossible.
In one month, the beach must be cut twice.
“If we don’t do that, the city will punish us,” Scholler said.
But the goal is similar to Pirita, Pikakar and P<0xC3><0xA4>rnu to get Stroomi beach under the international blue flag quality mark.
“Compared to Europe, there is much more work to be done in Estonia so that the beaches are maintained,” says Scholler.
We have more gravel and stones and harder to cut sand.
However, there will be less garbage on our shores than elsewhere in Europe.
Hearing that there is talk of garbage on the beach, Martin, who lives near Stroomi Beach, inevitably enters the conversation circle of journalists and cleaning staff, highlighting the current tight spots on the beach.
Every morning there is a rough picture.
The problem is with the birds and the bottle-pickers who have pulled the bags badly,” Martin said.
While it’s hard to expect people to be able to change their current behaviors, Martin hopes that the city government will take action with the trash cans and, for example, lay out blankets for them to prevent at least the birds from renovating there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of Stroomi beach.
You can see the city is taking care of it.
With children's fields, illuminated and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
“Once upon a time there was only one way to drive,” Martin said.
Treasures found in Stroom: coins, only coins
In the morning, a 40-year-old Dimitri has come to use a metal detector as a treasure hunt.
He does not think that he will find anything precious today or in the future.
Marines are not good enough for that.
"I've been working on this for a year and haven't found anything valuable yet," Dmitri said.
As a hobbyist, Dmitri’s treasure chest contains some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous needles, which will later throw away the trash.
There are usually coins.
“There are usually no gold, rings, and other things like that,” says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates remain at the previous level, as weak economic growth and a slowdown in inflation have softened speculation about the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain stable, as household incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers voted to retain 0.25% at rates of 6:2 and fewer members are calling for an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that the pressure on household incomes remains, as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the bank also noted that growth in rates will be necessary to manage Brexit-induced inflation over the next couple of years, and financial markets may need a higher than expected increase in borrowing costs.
Members also voted a year ago in favour of a partial withdrawal of the mammoth package from the economy, which was launched as a result of Brexit.
In February, the bank will end the long-term funding scheme, which offers cheap funding to banks, although it said that it now expects a higher bid of <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion under this scheme, which is <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision, the bank states: “In the MPC mid-prognosis, the gross domestic product (GDP) will remain in force in the near future, as the serious situation of real incomes in households will continue to affect consumption.”
With regard to the provisions, it was reiterated that in order to alleviate inflation, it was necessary to "tighten some of the strain of financial policy" and to "somewhat greater" the extent to which markets were expected.
The stock market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all kinds of jumps are gradual and limited.
The Bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this and next year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
In 2018, the forecast for growth of 1.8 percent remained.
After this news, the pound rate fell against the dollar and the euro.
The nail fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators, which have amassed growing expectations due to an increase in GDP rose from 0.2% to 0.3% in the second quarter of the previous three months.
The bank says growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will start to accumulate a bit of momentum.
The Bank’s most recent inflation report gave little reason to cheer up rising inflation and poor wage-earning households, saying the situation is going to get a little worse before the recovery.
It added that monetary policy could not prevent a hit in the next couple of years, but by the end of the three-year forecast, wages are expected to recover significantly.
The growing demand for British production is also fuelled by the slender pound, which partially compensates for lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the rates were reduced to 0.25% in August after the shocking EU referendum, which led to a sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the bank, it will probably take four years for prices and the economy to fully come to life.
Prior to the Bank’s last decision, there was a growing demand for raising rates, as inflation had increased pressure on narrow households; in July, three policymakers called for a 0.5% increase in rates.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected and is expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that the excessive growth compared to the 2-percent target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Head of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in fraud rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming more and more competitive again as lenders want to work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock market seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are about to come to an end, as refinancing, often at low cost and low rates, has become increasingly popular."
The NHS has written an HIV drug that has caused controversy to 10,000 people.
Since September, patients have had access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a battle in the Supreme Court over whether the NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England reported that national health care is now making an estimated 10,000 people available during the initial three-year clinical trial (PrEP) - a tablet that is given before the interval and has shown an 8% reduction in the risk of infection in people at high risk.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal supported the Supreme Court’s decision last year that the NHS was able to pay for PrEP, despite the Authority’s own claims that the drug should be financed by local authorities.
NHS England CEO Simon Stevens hailed the move as a “new far-reaching intervention” on Thursday, while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as “a turning point.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October, more clinics will be added before the program is launched everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines that is taken before the procedure to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before an interval means that there are a sufficient number of certain medicines in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines may be taken every day or no later than two hours before the interval.
Suitable candidates for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual people, and people whose partners have been infected with HIV and are not being treated.
Clinics identify suitable people who agree to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transsexual people, and those whose HIV-positive partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will be able to register their wish to participate in the program at the local sexual health clinic.
The program costs <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to get the medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who the medicine is intended for and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said: “This new comprehensive intervention should complement and enhance the widespread and ever more successful fight against HIV transmission.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of struggle against one of humanity’s greatest health problems.”
Deborah Gold, NAT’s chief executive, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted to those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change England’s HIV epidemic.
As of September, people at high HIV risk in England will have access to a powerful new tool, which is individually manageable and independent from negotiations with a partner, through this NHS-funded clinical trial, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, executive director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “It is now essential to ensure that the clinical trial is postponed quickly across the country and that no HIV risk group members are left behind.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been obtained, we are on our way there to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of contracting HIV.
Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after six months of delays and the government's leg pulling.
Evidence shows how major changes this medicine can bring to the end of the spread of HIV prevention and its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us one step closer to a full understanding of PrEP’s benefits.
Now it is important for the clinical trial to be taken over as quickly as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV, and to bring us step by step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
Electricity prices rose by 12% in Estonia and decreased in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference in next-day electricity exchange prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros this June, Elering reported.
The main reason for the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average electricity exchange price last month was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour and the price increased by 12 percent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros and the Nord Pool system price was 26.37 euros per megawatt-hour.
Prices rose by 12 and 7 percent, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved 75% of the last month’s hours to Estonia and 16% of Estonia’s hours to Finland.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not take place on the next day.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity moved 99 per cent of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73 per cent of the hours were in use with the entire transmission capacity.
According to transactions made on the last trading day of July, Nasdaq OMX on the market could be around EUR 34 per megawatt-hour in August and EUR 37 per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the production price of electricity rose last month and the transactions took place at a price of EUR 5.04-5.47 per tonne.
High living - semi-detached and smart designs have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate broker, swapped her large Knightsbridge home for Earls Court's apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold the apartment further is a statement of respect for the new design.
“Before that, I lived on a much larger surface with my former partner at Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for something that would be the same for the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day.”
Since the first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete renovation course.
In the beginning, it was an apartment with one bedroom and a complex layout - in order to reach the bedroom step, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a semi-floor to use the high ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed, operating in Notting Hill, to take advantage of the 3.8-metre-high slabs and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
Yet it was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a semi-floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach the matter creatively.
"Metal construction is quite complex," he explains.
“We had to rearrange the rooms, so that they would sit on top of each other, without having to bow down.
It wasn’t just about building the platform, we used steel construction to make sure the height of both the upper and lower rooms was right.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two full-length rooms in a space apart from each other, with many dramatic elements.
Half-floor from the old copper light Retrouvius opens from the window to the glamorous living room under the view.
Gold furniture with a mirror surface, silver details and a retro-reflective Serge Mouille's light accentuating the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, space and light pollution.
Mirrors have been added to both ends of the short corridor to make it feel longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror leaves behind the impression of a window opening into the second room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage space for all Joanne’s dishes and glass requirements.
The living room adds charm to the possibility of closing the kitchen if not used, creating an image of a glamorous room.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
In this kitchen, however, there is a unique fact that it is a type of garage with a lift door.
“There was a bit of a need for design,” explains Erfan from the MDF door, which was spoofed with steel strength.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it slips very easily when it is pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage, Joanne now has 16 additional square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
“In the end, the floor is what you sell – or what gives real estate value,” says Erfan.
"The real estate agent enters the room in an outdated form and makes calculations based on the surface of the floor."
Here they have been able to increase the floor surface, while using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
“Materials are the ones you touch and that help create an emotional connection with your home,” says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the power cable on the wall.
It’s important, but it doesn’t make the heart sound.”
This shows that a good design and an enlarged area will help to make something amazing out of a fairly ordinary apartment.
In fact, they can make you want not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
Dane Jensen is a Chicago-based chief financial officer who competes with a colleague for a job promotion.
You don’t read any other than the amount of money earned, beside which all ethics are forgotten.
A man sees his wife and three children only in the early morning and late at night.
In the first half of the film, I think it’s a version of the business world of Card House – even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler’s speech is similar.
As the film progresses, however, the less circumstantial element remains, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers is becoming more and more apparent.
As a life-long experience, the main character’s illness can become cancerous.
Now we have to make a choice between work and family life.
Dreaming of an architect, the son makes his father walk to Chicago's big buildings to think about really important things like faith, goodness, love..., without even touching the twin towers of disaster.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father’s eyes, there is a feeling that the filmmakers have set out to get the audience to cry for sure, because even the most heartbroken viewer can’t hold back the tears in the face of the suffering of a loving cancer boy.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, the father finally understands the morality of his work and does a good job for an old man looking for a job.
Now I’m betting on myself – if the movie is happy with itself, then I’ll premiere my transparency after the movie with coffee, but if I’m wrong, then the scriptwriter can thank you for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a suspicion that I'm running out of coffee when my husband calls Dane from the hospital, and the man slowly storms down the corridor to the palace.
However, the son has miraculously recovered, and although his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be a positive one, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can also feel good – I can already predict the end of American drama quite well!
In honor of the truth, the film is well-constructed, all the elements necessary for this are available.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the morality is beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
Maybe this movie will do well.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it, too.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the White House’s new chief of staff plans to limit President Trump’s incoming flow of information, including news, in the hope that it will keep the top level in the water.
Here's a breakdown from reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with senior officials on his first day of work, he brought out a key problem in the White House, which he planned to solve by getting bad information into the hands of the president.
Kelly told officials that the information must go through him, whether on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he shared good information with him.”
Kelly’s diagnosis seems entirely logical, but others have tried it as well, and they have failed to control Trump by monitoring his media use.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he’s in the White House, his television viewing habits haven’t gone anywhere.
"When the candidate Trump was a victim of an unfair media outburst, he was paid to show that he was also portrayed in the influential publications honestly," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that, “According to a month-old former campaigner, the key to controlling Trump’s Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady amount of praise as well.”
All right, all right.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter usage habits have ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaigners know something that the rest of us don’t know that Trump’s provisions would have been even more inflammable without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about the rumors that Trump didn't post.
When his helpers were able to save him from either or a couple of times of trouble, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from consistently engendering controversy.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that people at the White House, made up of competing clicks, are exceptionally trying to promote their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be reliable.
In May, Politico, reflecting the whole course of the story, wrote about the willingness of advisers to feed the president information with strategically questionable value.
One example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher, is the following:
“The facts and former Trump subordinates say that Trump can react to negative pressure, especially damaging information, explosively, taking a firm stand to find out their source.
That was also the case at the end of February when someone gave the president a copy of a maliciously printed copy of a GotNews.com article on Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the "source of multiple intelligences" to the White House.
It doesn’t matter if Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter due to the humiliation, or that he didn’t offer any specific evidence, or that he has also made false allegations in the past and taken them back.
Trump read the article and started coming from below about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that former chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House bureau chief Rob Porter "has tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents arriving at Trump".
How did it work?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his aides are still competing for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from outside the capital will not be allowed to perform on stage.
There are a lot of foreigners in the city of Tallinn.
Those with whom the Evening Post got to talk admitted that they were playing in the old town without the permission of the city government.
First, we found three street musicians near the gates of Viru, who had brought with them the same number of dogs.
It was clear that the musicians with rasta patients and broken clothes were backpackers who needed one shower for a beard.
Despite the appearance, the society’s only woman played the accordion with a fun rhythm story, while a man next to her invited three balls into the jungle and the passers-by closer.
The third man had sat next to them in a backpack and smoked a self-made twisted prawn in the heart room.
These three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing people.
Bob, who played the accordion with Naomi and juggled with the balls, said they were playing music on the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the company’s appearance was to collect ticket money on the same day on a ship travelling to Finland.
Asked if they had asked permission from the city for music in the old town, Naomi and Bob shook their heads.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple and most of the time the permits are given for a month or so.
“There’s no point in paying for it,” Bob said.
When we arrived at the gates of Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with the musicians and drove them away.
With backpacks and dogs, Seltkond moved to the Viru Centre Crossroads to try his luck.
There were also three half of the young men on Viru Street, one of whom played violin, the other clarinet and the third had brought along a loud electronic piano.
“We’re here to provide people with entertainment, to spread music and joy, and to make money for fuel and living,” explains the trio’s pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that the city government must be allowed to perform.
"Of course we don't have it," he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
“Of course, when the police come, we’re going somewhere else, but we have to try,” he added.
As part of the public procurement programme for central banks in the euro area, Eesti Pank bought <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>149 million in July, while the central bank’s debt portfolio grew to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.36 billion.
The central bank will not publish more detailed information on purchases.
The President of the Bank of Estonia, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained in response to the consultation of the members of the Riigikogu that the Eurosystem’s central bank reserve plan covers three different purchase programmes: covered bonds, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PPs).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors who sell bonds to invest money elsewhere.
As a result of purchases, lower-risk asset production falls and it motivates investors to take higher risks.
As a rule, each central bank purchases its own government bonds under the public debt purchase programme, while other countries’ bonds are not purchased.
As the Estonian state has not issued any bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the allocated volume.
Replacement purchases are also made by central banks in those countries where the supply of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
With Hansson’s approval, Eesti Pank generally purchases European institutions’ bonds, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank’s bonds.
Eesti Pank has been purchasing bonds under the reserve purchase programme since March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering’s bonds were also called, but from June 2016 Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering’s bonds.
From June onwards, both Elering and Eesti Energia will buy Finnish central bank bonds on behalf of the central banks of the euro area.
Passengers are breaking the law and returning to the “millionaires’ district”
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have fallen back into a frenzy with determined migrants who have ignored the council’s excavated plot to reclaim the land that is left behind in their villas.
Passengers have parked their 20 trailer villages in the field of a rich "million-dollar district" near Solihull Street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after they were just kicked out of there in May, not letting themselves be confused by the trench in which they were dug to prevent their entry into the council.
The tactical team found a weak spot in the defensive boundaries, pushing their vehicles through the unobstructed part of what had been left on foot.
Residents of the marshy area have complained to Solihull's council, saying the council is "useless in dealing with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after their expulsion from Bentley Heath, where they dropped passers-by with stones.
The Council must be ashamed that they are acting because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The passengers were there in May, they were driven away and now they are back again.
They came in last night, probably even more today.”
He added: "The Birmingham Council of Commissioners knows how to deal with such matters by acquiring long barriers to the protection of their parks.
I live on the road to Streetsbrook, and I’m not happy that I have to continue paying the council fee if the council can’t even prevent that.”
One local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said: "This is ridiculous. We just saw the last of these migrants leave, and a new arrest is already underway.
This time the number has increased and the grassland has even been seen remembering the horse.”
A Solihulli County Council representative said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campground in the country near the Streetsbrook Road, and we are cooperating with Solihulli Police. We are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
The collection of evidence is very helpful if as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling number 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them."
The weekend festival is visited by Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, among others, who is happy to be able to bring real world top names to Estonia.
To the question of why the weekend festival is so important for Estonians, Saar answers that it should be asked of all those who enjoyed the three days of the festival’s talk in full.
But then he realizes that the real actors in his field have come to P<0xC3><0xA4>rnu.
“In view of the level of artists who have been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre will be brought home – this often does not happen in our country,” he said.
What kind of artists do you think the world is talking about the most?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for me, one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
After all, at some point in time, all of us have turned our feet,” he said.
But he'll come up with names like Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, we also have our own Estonian makers: starting with NO<0xC3><0x8B>P and they can be read a whole series.
In fact, this concentration of well-known names is very high,” he says.

Audi renews up to 850,000 diesel vehicles amid criticism from automakers
The day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it was offering software expansion for more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to BMW Chairman, the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including the home city of BMW Munich, which are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
No company has described these actions as a recall.
European automakers have been promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide separated from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
In addition, the cost of equipment to be installed to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles for the automotive industry will increase, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German automakers are under extensive investigation, Angela Merkel’s government is also accused of failing to heed the warnings of powerful automakers and of pointing to the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen’s mistakes, which silenced the so-called use of sledgehammers, which allowed to adjust the emissions sample car to meet regulations at the time of testing, but withdrew under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics sub-unit of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may go to court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when the authorities accused Audit of installing the system in order to circumvent the requirements of European emissions, thereby expanding the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Audi’s involvement in the study could be a big hope for Volkswagen, a luxury car manufacturer generating a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
Estonian schools are awarded the European Union flags for 20,000 euros.
The Ministry of Education plans to buy the flag of the European Union for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the presidency.
With dimensions of 105x158 cm, 570 educational institutions will receive the flag of the European Union.
The flags are intended for indoor exposure, they must also be carried out in high-quality printing technology in indoor spaces with an air-conditioning system, says the ERR news portal.
On the label of the flag there is the text: "Kingdom for Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union of Estonia.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20,000, or one flag will cost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35.
Journalist's murder underscores growing danger in Mexico
Riodoce employees usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to expose the state of Sinaloa’s most recent chaos, immersing in organized crime, corrupt officials, and unstoppable drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They are told that it is important to change their routine.
Two senior writers discuss which one feels safer: whether to bring the children to the office, which was the target of the 2009 grenade attack, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the front of the room: "enemies", "neutral", "allies".
They ask reporters for names in each column to provide no evidence, enough impressions and input.
When the government or cartels are hired, the entire list of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists is being undermined, making it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
Since the swearing-in of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012, at least 25. 589 journalists have been killed and at least 25. 589 journalists have been killed, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
The latest deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Javier Valdez Cardenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug abuse.
His absence gives a deep sense, although his presence can be felt everywhere on the facade of the Riodoce building hangs a large picture of the middle finger showing Valdez with the letter "Justice" and two 30th-century reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing a t-shirt with a t-shirt on his face, wearing a t-shirt on his forehead.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
While a separate public prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, only two cases have been taken to court in the data of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As is the case with most annual drug trafficking and organized crime-related murders, the number of which is in the thousands, journalists’ killers rarely come to court.
Riodoce’s editorial continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data of the killers and the lack of fairness, Ibarra said, there is little benefit from the meeting on security.
"It's a very silly time to waste in this meeting," he says.
"Until the cause is known, you'll be fooling everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before two men stopped him in the red Toyota Corolla. He was forced out of the car and shot 12 times. It is expected to be named after the newspaper, which translates to "twelfth river".
The gunman drove Valdez in the car and made an accident near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He was left with a wife and two adult children.
The rumours spread freely in Culiacan.
However, there is mainly silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival clicks are struggling to fulfill a power requirement.
It doesn’t matter that on the streets of Sinaloa, some people are thrown down every day, or several people, or that the morgue is tucked away in the lavishly decorated double-glazed mausoleums of the drug king, which are larger than many living houses.
Let us forget for a moment that peacetime refers to the fact that only one cartel is headed by a seafaring state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers associated with his work, Riodoce co-founder and chairman Ismail Bojorquez (60) feels the immense grief that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that the killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first of these was the publication of an interview with the warring cartel rivaling Guzman's sons, Damaso Lopez, in February.
This article may have angered the boy’s suspected members of the force who bought all copies of the publication as soon as they arrived at the newspaper kiosks.
The second error was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country on his own security after the seizure occurred in another newspaper report that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence directed against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to be there forever.
In 2003, he worked as a veteran reporter for the newspaper Noroeste, when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar units.
Bojorquez said that in Sinaloa "it was impossible to deal with the press without the drug problem".
The magazine gradually became familiar with its bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish powerful research without fear of censorship and readers smothered in print, from which they were able to read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the magazine won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its Latin American publications.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) Prize for Freedom of the Press for its courage to follow Mexican narcologists wherever it leads.
He admitted openly that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said as he accepted the AKK award.
Last October, he told Rompeviento TV in an interview that the drug trade is a way of life in Sinaloa.
“You have to take on the task that comes with a journalist’s office, the second option is to play dumb.
I don’t want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn’t tell you what was going on.”
Riodoce’s collective misses Valdez, the funny man who ran away like a madrasa, a friend who kindly shared his aunt and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He was always wearing his hat.
He walked from the office across the road to El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his routine love became his destiny.
His death has also led them to doubt how to do their job best and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you mess with those women, their children, their legal businesses, those secret landing sites that are used to transport drugs."
"These things shouldn't have been touched," Bojorquez said.
The result is strong self-esteem and self-control even in the best of times.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said the problem is that "the smell can be deceiving... and that's how it happened with Javier."
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros and other states, which are home to the poisoning of revenue smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff gathered for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before it was revealed that only the software for sale to governments had been used in Mexico to track journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two police officers were looking for relief from the 40-degree heat in a tree shade.
The government appointed them to oversee the Riodoce office, located in a four-storey building in the Culiacan middle class neighborhood.
Some reporters were wondering if these police officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers the governor himself has branded as untrustworthy.
Several months have passed since reporters have travelled to mountainous areas where the de facto control is in the hands of drug gangs.
This week’s edition of Riodoce covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor’s hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement as to who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was time to be careful when it was time to write down what everyone in the city knows the restaurant is both a hub for drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the previous century.
Recently, several IRP Governors have been accused of corruption in broad-based cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the previous incidents at the same location, including how Guzman's son, wearing El Chapo, escaped from the military route.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched the Valdez column to get information about human abduction from the best sources.
"We would have known what had happened before," said Villarreal, 46, whose tiny bodybuilding has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels are disconnected from our sources."
Valdez’s office has been given storage space for labels and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and the editorial staff have been given something they never knew how to expect from activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez still grabbed a couple and headed to the local prosecutor’s office the next morning for a statement about another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n three days after Valdez was killed.
The body has been found to have been burned, and officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists throughout the country have become more vocal and criticize the phrase "SOS press" on the streets and buildings as an organized protest.
On this day, President Bojorquez is out in Washington, trying to gather international support in the case of Valdez for the establishment of justice.
The day after Valdez's death, in a meeting with Sinaloa's governor, Ramirez accused the authorities of murdering and killing journalists for telling the truth.
After that, he asked for him to steer the government’s actions from reflecting elsewhere, worrying that anger has affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists have been organized into "restricted" by crime, fellow civil servants and any society.
In his latest book, The Narcotics Journal, he wrote that not only do they kill drug gangs, but also do so at the behest of politicians and security forces who have been organized with crime.
Last year, the media watchdog Articulo 19 owned more than half of the attacks on police and state officials by journalists.
"In Mexico, you're going to die because you want to be silenced," Ramirez said.
The murders obviously have a blood-staining effect.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found along with a letter supposedly signed by the Los Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my reporting."
Next to his head cut off, the computer and the earphones were lying.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after their correspondent Miroslava Breach was killed in March.
Others continue to do so, as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke to the drug cartel in public with the headline "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from home countries or even the country.
It is a nervous decision.
Exiles are hard to find jobs and they still have to block the streets in order to avoid the dangers.
And they are sometimes chased, as is believed to have happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in a Mexico apartment three months after he was stabbed in Veracruz.
Those who stay put and continue to work need to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to become a poet, admits that exposing a drug dealer scares her.
"Mexico is on its way to hell and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
One recent Friday night, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce editors sat in front of the office on a walkway and robbed the beer when suddenly all the phones started vibrating.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people were killed, according to confirmed data, in future exchanges between rival powers and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartels found in the region.
On the sidewalk, reporters put the news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
The next day we needed a change.
The sirens were worried about another future change in the area.
Bojorquez hid to the police officers in charge to see if they were on duty.
When they were scared, they didn't show it.
The magazine’s founder fell under a massive portrait, with his middle finger visible all over Sinaloa, Riodoce’s employees followed him.
"How could it be possible to think of closure at all," said Bojorquez, "if on the day Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to get him to report to the streets?"
Dinosaur used protective paint to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a shape, although quite frightening.
Scientists have so far disclosed the first findings regarding the incredible rhinoceros-sized existence discovered by the Canadian mine, which has so well preserved that experts have described it as the “Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.”
It has been preserved so well that it was even possible to detect that the skin covered with his furs was reddish-brown in color and his past had been somewhat "curious".
The report, published in the journal Current Biology, described the presence as “the most well-preserved salmon dinosaur ever found” and “one of the best dinosaurs in the world.”
Fossils are a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the crisis, 110-112 million years ago.
It’s incredibly good preservation has plagued scientists who describe it as “really significant.”
This veggie-covered dietitian is the best preserved type of fossil that has ever been found, according to the journal National Geographic.
It was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he excavated Suncor Millenium in a mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that didn’t remember the surrounding stone, and decided to investigate further.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, work was done on excavating the animal from 2,500 male (1100 kg) of land.
After all this hard work, the final result is now finally ready to be presented to the public.
“When you blink a little bit, you can almost believe that she’s sleeping,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where being is exposed.
“This is going to be one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur species of the scientific era – the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.”
When he examined the skin, the researchers found that this herbivore, which is covered in feathers and resembles a walking tank, was likely to be significantly at risk from muscle-eating dinosaurs.
This multi-hulled dinosaur used red and white protective paint to hide from predators, and applied a shielding technique called a deterrent, which is also used by many modern animals.
This, according to experts, allowed the dinosaur to better blend into the environment and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs likely kept him hunting.
A member of the 110-million-year-old nodular family, it first arrived in May and is now to be visited in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have now investigated the existence and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory at the Borealist Mark Mitchell Museum, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to expose the animal.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the fins in the animal's body.
They discovered a deterrent - a method of defense prevalent in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper side of the being was darker than the lower.
While resistance is widespread, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealis is considerably larger than today’s animals with resistance.
This suggests that the dinosaur was actively hunted by other dinosaurs from the muscle-eaters, that evolution preferred shelter as a survival tactic rather than a counter-offensive.
However, most animals that use modern-day contraception — e.g. deer, zebras, or armadillos — are much smaller and more vulnerable as a result, suggesting that nodosaurus had to really struggle to survive.
“Strong hunting of dinosaurs covered with huge and abundant feathers shows how dangerous dinosaurs could have been more predatory than dinosaurs of the critical era,” Brown said.
A chemical analysis of organic compounds in Finland also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to research the animal to get clues about its life, including the content of this intestinal tract, to find out what the animal ate for its last bite.
They believe that the dinosaur fell dead in the river, thus flowing into the sea, where it pushed its back in front of the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans probably extended far farther inland than they are today.
“This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered in furry skin, while it has also remained three-dimensional, preserving the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in a crisis period.
You don’t have to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it – it’s enough just to sneeze your eyes and it seems like he’s sleeping.”
There was a time of crisis when dinosaurs - theropods - roamed the Earth with huge two-legged skeletons.
Although all of these king Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealis, it could be hunted by some of its terrifying predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 meters) long and six-ton monster.
Scientists, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was threatened after death by the sea and that mummified mud.
The existence was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, when he excavated the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is best preserved in the world’s fur dinosaurs, including skin and furs, and it’s a complete collection up to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20-inch ora came out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this veggie-covered veggie-eater went through what is now Western Canada, until the glory of the flooded river over its open sea.
However, the dinosaur’s underwater burial site helped to keep its fins in great detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen have been so well preserved that the remains of the skin are still covered by the slender fins along the dinosaur’s skulls.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: “Such a degree of preservation is as rare as a lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
Stoned skin remnants still cover the animal’s convoluted fur plates located in the tree.
The right front foot rests next to him, and five of his toes are stretched upwards.
I can count the feathers on his back."
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Who are the streets for?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was in total shock.
Just a day after the trip to New York, this St. Louis resident sat in a rented room in bed via Airbnb, browsing on his phone on Facebook.
He was surprised by the post of his former schoolmate.
It read, “The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he still lives on the street.”
He was confused as to why no one else had posted this information in his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
With <0x40>TheePharoah's posts were repeatedly shared on his timeline.
The St. Louis area rapper delivered a real-time radio broadcast about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's life from a body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put down his phone, but later that night he saw a flash again, which this time reported on the gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
They shared photos of the police force and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father and still kept saying, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a real-time stream where a police officer stood in front of a group of protestors with a barking dog.
In the second video, another police officer shouted, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he thought to himself, "It's unusual."
"It's not the kind of murder we've been used to and what we might call typical."
I felt terrible at the moment.
I was angry and I cried.”
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
When he landed at 23:00, he went to his father for his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would drive two Fergusons the next morning.
What happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson over the next three years is a central theme in the new documentary film "Who's Streets?", which will feature in theaters on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and persistence from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who have fulfilled the demands of the streets.
When Ferrell and his daughter – who had a floral dress on her back and a matching crown on her head – drove to Ferguson’s side, they were talking again about the subject they had talked about before that morning repeatedly earlier about the black experience and living conditions.
“Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?” he recalls asking himself.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't take him with me," Ferrell said later.
"What's happening now is... the culmination of what's happening in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and organization, and at the same time know the different aspects of black experience and living conditions, and what we must do in order to be free and free.
Even if I manage to raise her so that she doesn’t experience self-absorbed racism, she’s no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would do him a favor if I protected him from this world.”
The first stop they made when they arrived at Ferguson was on the way to South Florissant, a police station across the street, which had become a sort of camp, where activists were waiting for news about policeman Darren Wilson, who was not ultimately charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with the local business owner, who made the southern ingredients.
They put the food bags together and helped the protesters divide them.
For Ferrell, he slowly began to take the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism changed completely after August 9,” he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was president of the Least Endurance Students Union and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I didn’t have any organizational experience.
It's all just polite."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met a film co-director, Sabaah Folayan, during a nightly performance.
Folayan said that he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was going on.
Ferrell’s head raised the question: “Are you trying to document what’s going on or find a story that can be used?”
Such skepticism was due to an innumerable number of cases where people – often whites – come to the community and seek to cut off its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We had heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson is not being heard and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already hit hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the area who was known for his activism with regard to prisoners sentenced to death.
His involvement made the project compelling for Ferrell and six other locals, who were watched by the film's "Who's Streets?" team after Brown's shooting for years.
“In this documentary, no one talks about us or us, but we talk about ourselves,” Davis said.
“It was important to me how these people are portrayed, because that’s how I’m portrayed.”
While the goal was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience – it was to show that the movement was not “a savior’s guide, but a community gathering”, as Folayan said – the film became the most open part of him.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing for the first time when he saw the finished linen work.
"But I realized that doing this work and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
What’s more, Ferrelli’s story emphasizes and re-emphasizes the role of a black gay woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement, who thought on social media in 2012 after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin out the topic #BlackLivesMatter, are homosexuals.
“Black women in the lead role have kept the movement in the field overall,” Ferrell said, “and that’s precisely because we have to constantly fight on multiple fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear all that burden.”
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black gay women".
He argues, however, that "it is not a matter of creating equal opportunities of any kind" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the centerpiece of the film because of his identity.
"He was a man who was able to breathe the right energy," he said.
“But it’s not a coincidence that she was right on the front line, because as a black gay woman, living in such conclaves, there’s a lot of weight.
You can see his energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, news cameras have long since disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
During Ferrell's statement, the penalty for blocking the road will last for another 2.5 years.
He describes the social-political atmosphere in the area he calls home, simply "a terrible mess".
However, he still considers the important mantra he has been eating since he went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
7 Tips on How to Get Over the Spoon After Weekend Party
Some of the tougher males will find help after the sundown party, which is a problem, too.
Or, as they say, "beautiful, stick to the potion."
But this is only an inevitable postponement and a good boost to health.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning after today's and tomorrow's weekend's trolley - or any other party - and get over the pommel as painfully as possible?
Drink water.
Alcohol down and after, after a big party in the morning... or possibly even instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses alcohol by consuming a lot of liquid, it must somehow be recovered.
Along with water, minerals are excreted from the body and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since after clicking, the sleep is often irritated, it is especially good if the product is bubble-free or just lightly gassed.
Go for a walk.
Certainly, it would not cost a pigeon to go to the grandmother to break the trees - it can turn out to be a fateful lie.
But a light walk helps the body to remember what it feels like to be alive.
Laying down on the floor and removing the foam is a more time-consuming way to heal.
Give your body energy back slowly and carefully.
When you’re starting from yesterday’s overeating to your stomach, it’s definitely not worth trying to load a large fat meal.
For example, start with a fresh juice that contains fruit sugars that are quietly marketed to your body.
If the health of the southern location is already suffering, you might want to try, for example, a chicken pox.
And then a little later on, I'll be back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will release your body from the last water.
As I said before, water and juice are your friends.
Do not contribute to painkillers.
When you take a painkiller in the evening to prevent pimples, your liver should not only deal with alcohol but also with paracetamol or ibuprofen and thus lose performance.
So you break your liver even more and in the future, the pancreas is even worse.
In addition, painkillers do not stay in the body for long.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, do not do it with a completely empty stomach - it will irritate your throat with a torn stomach.
If you don’t have a partner, you can do well with yourself.
It works the same way as walking, but you can’t have an orgasm while walking.
However, avoid over-active tempo and swirling postures - during sneezing, the physical effort should be moderate.
Make a joke.
Time with friends-carers silly talk, make simple noises and smile friendlyly about yourself as well as others (caring).
A joke and a laugh may not drive away the bush, but with their help it is certainly more fun to endure the aftereffects.
Once in a while, the bubble will go over anyway!
A Northwestern professor and an employee of the University of Oxford are sought for suspect in the murder
Police say they are looking nationwide for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University, who have become suspicious after a man’s body was found in one of the Chicago luxury apartments with deadly handcuffs.
According to court documents from Cook County, arrest warrants were issued Monday without bail for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren, accused of first-degree murder for their alleged involvement with Trenton H. James Cornell-Duran.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbings.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
The police got a phone call and found a victim on arrival at the Grand Plaza apartment building, whose body had several stab wounds.
According to officials, at the scene, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead and investigators consider the stabbing to be a murder, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a co-professor in microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of public relations at the University, said in an emailed statement that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and has been banned from entering the city halls of Northwestern University.
“This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the competent authorities, and the University of Northwestern is cooperating with investigators,” said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior assistant in the financial department of the University of Oxford.
A representative from the University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been in touch with the UK police and are ready to assist the U.S. intelligence agencies in any way possible."
In addition, the statement said Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of communications at the Chicago Police Department, urges the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have an idea of where they are staying, but we’re working more and more intensively to determine the exact location,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, the suspects are being sought by both local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the Grand Plaza apartment building manager, who had just received a cryptic hint that something had happened in apartment No. 1008.
According to police reports, the incident was a sight-seeing incident.
It is not clear whether the incident itself took place on July 27.
He said the security cameras would confirm Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Lathamil and the victim had a relationship," added Guglielmi.
The management of the Grand Plaza sent a letter to the residents: "The police are currently working on the chronology of events and the background of the victim and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that it was a family affair."
Start-up companies that will help your company avoid becoming Uber for the next time
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys had come.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
“This system just wasn’t consistent and objective,” said Errett, who runs an e-commerce company that sells hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called for help from outsiders.
The focus is on new types of human resources startups that help companies find out what their employees are feeling.
When leasing and licensing software, which is intended to measure the involvement of employees, they allow companies to conduct urgent surveys, target certain teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and with a warm line of conduct on the management of complaints and complaints to the management of complaints and to the management of complaints.
“Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit that are designed to monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City, a startup company in Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by a highly skilled employee.
According to Erretti, he has received a much better overview of what his employees think and feel over the three years he has been using Glint.
In addition to the surveys for emergency investigations and specific teams, this provides a company heat map that provides an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to find out the reasons.
Companies have begun to realize that they need to stay on track with their work culture, not to turn into the next Uber, which has been plagued by scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an appalling environment where those who dared to speak were punished.
For startups like Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
According to Let’s Talk Payments, the global management, regulatory and compliance sector could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Financial Technology Statistics website Let’s Talk Payments.
Convercent, a startup operating in Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and identify inappropriate behavior, this year noted Uber’s dubious reputation in the background of interest and growth in activity.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent lets companies send customized impulse surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat map problematic areas.
It also provides an anonymous message link, which allows employees to report inappropriate behavior to the company.
And when it comes to the executive, the complaints go directly to the board.
“A public opinion has been anathema to regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if it is found that a company treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, the company may face serious consequences such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and lawsuits, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and operations and offer an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
When an employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or email address of the corporate headquarters, file an official complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a repulsive and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday general counsel James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that a company is using Convert, however, it is possible to identify and deal with problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that have not previously reached managers who have operated in other cities or offices located in states faster.
“I can get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of employees,” said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday risk management group.
"And we will protect our participants from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002 after auditor Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But only when "social media matured", companies realized that they could not prevent their black laundry from being publicly washed online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supportive of both startups.
In February, Convercent was funded by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the value of the capital raised to $47 million.
In November, Glinti invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company’s total net worth to $60 million.
Such investments will not come as a surprise, taking into account the interrelationship between business, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that today’s workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, there are high salaries and interesting projects are just bets on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they are devoting their time to a company that has a positive mission.
“When people are happy in the company, feel that they are being listened to and that the work they are doing is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, who is a general benefit and employee experience department vice president at LinkedIn.
Investors earn income when their portfolio companies are doing well; businesses are doing well when the employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytics tools allow you to increase employee engagement and engagement, then it’s no wonder they find support.
According to experts in the culture of work, having data on employee involvement is important.
However, this data is useful if the company’s followers do not do anything about it.
In fact, when a company asks its employees for feedback, it can create expectations that the expected changes will occur.
And if the changes do not take place quickly enough or not at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
“When you ask 4000 proposals, you need to be ready for 4000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, president of Kotter International, a consulting and business management company that has seen companies make mistakes in relying on too much data.
“Because if things don’t end, the employees think, ‘Did you actually get to hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don’t care, why should I care?”
According to Erretti, Madison Reed, who is currently conducting six surveys among employees, has been able to implement the measures on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glinti.
And after receiving feedback from employees who were disappointed with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and offer communication training to deal with problems.
Ruby Tuesday, however, is gathering new data about employees and it is hoped that in the long run, it will bring with it a long-term commitment industry known for its large workforce flow.
“If you’re not committed to ensuring transparency, you’re losing people,” Vitrano said.
"When you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses.”
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltic: revenue is growing rapidly
While the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes in a reference to the European Central Bank report.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999 total economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Success is behind the low debt burden, rapidly improving institutions and a business- and free-market-friendly policy.
“The Baltic states, in one of Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries where real GDP per capita is significantly closer to the EU average,” the central bank said in a statement.
While the objective is that the total economic output per person be compared to the wealthier Western Europe, in 2015 the total production of the Baltic economies per person was only 2/3 of the average 15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement cycle.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for a better salary from abroad.
While the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, locals are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the most recent Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies are doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, this was seen by slightly less than half of the respondents on their country’s economies.
The NCAA’s decision to cancel twice a day workouts will make the days of Bruins long
It’s almost 23:00 when a troubadour of UCLA football players stops to chat on the edge of a new field of practice located in the team’s campus.
Some of them have peeled off the back of the shirt, revealing their training camp’s first day of efforts to sweat the back.
For a large part of the team, these arrival minutes offer a mid-day break.
During summer courses, players will head back to the finals after three hours of training before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings the next morning at 6.30am.
“The next three days are a real test for them,” said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday’s Tuesday.
The NCAA’s decision to cancel players’ twice-daily workouts has actually made their days longer – at least until one-half of the final exams are done on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA’s first three training sessions were scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to suit players’ tight schedule.
Transitioning from two workouts per day means more than one workout days - the start of the Bruins training camp was increased compared to the previous season almost a week ahead of the division and for the first time during the six Westwood Mora trainings during the summer courses.
They will have 18 training sessions until August 20, before official preparations for the September opening game against Texas A&M begin.
Mora says he’s in favor of the NCAA rule change, although it adds another day-to-day agenda item to players’ tight schedules.
“They have a huge burden on three or four days and that’s a serious challenge,” Mora said.
"And they break themselves through this trial; they strive, they are fine young.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really nice."
When the camp is over, UCLA will make training closed, which is not an easy task at all, taking into account a clear view of these squares close to the parking lot and the nearby Luskin center, a higher-class hotel that has already been reached from the top of the doorpost to the top of the street.
As of this weekend, the hotel's players are busy with Bruins, but Mora admitted that problems can arise with open rooms during the season.
"We're taking security measures," Mora said.
“It’s a real concern and it’s by no means exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film a workout from there.
If you have a record of training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we're using a security team there and on the 8th parking lot.
We do our best by using what we have.
I try not to worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
The elections of Savisaare-Ivanova, who was born in the Central District, the electoral union of the businessmen who were expelled from the Reformation, Kristiina Ojulandi and the ECR, who were forced to leave the Union forces of Maria Kaljuste, who were created to show their hope for our Tallinn and the party people in the same way that the election of Tegustulda from the beginning of Tallinn - seems to be the party.
However, the tibuses are considered in the autumn, and the key question is whether they all have enough disappointed voters.
Who's staying with Savisaare?
If Edgar Savisaare’s support group has declined as a child, he may miss the events organized in honor of his electoral alliance.
One member of the National Assembly, some former and current midwives and many unknown faces - will such a one be part of the electoral alliance?
And is the reason why some loyal supporters and friends of Savisaare are keeping away from applying in Tallinn, may be looking for the fact that the "Saviisaare list" of kidnappers, which is headed by corrupters and corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the city government for a Russian-language pop show, in which Lasnam<0xC3><0xA4>e is the oldest part of the city; and in every sense the original computer game, in which the main character J<0xC3><0xBC>ri Ratas must avoid the bumps and bumps on the road - is this how the 17-year-old will try to pick up the choice from the middle of 16?
We’re still waiting for the other parties to come up with an idea of a young election campaign.
If Channel 2 or TV3 is watching viewers from the beginning of August instead of the entertainment channel against the black box, there are two options: to agree that only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinna TV and English-language France24 channels will be seen in the future, or to surrender to a dozen or so teleoperatories each month.
There are probably also those who initially enjoy the ad-free television experience in public, but in the end still - albeit reluctantly - pay for the telephoto and commercials.
The noise of music, the noise of the people and the waste left on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don’t want to be a part of the noise itself, instead of having a headache at home, it’s worth exploring the country – and leaving the sleeping place for a generous amount to the festival guests.
Washington changes the rules of the green card
The media outlets cite President Donald Trump, who said a new U.S. immigration plan is planned to change the rules of the green card.
The plan foresees a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and the president supports them.
The bill will go to a two-house debate in Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money because it changes the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce network migration and will begin to replace the current program.
The new application process gives preference to candidates who speak English and who have the financial means to support themselves and the skills that will benefit our economy," Trump said in a statement.
The young people of the Siberian Seto move to the city, retirees back to the country.
The Anatoli of Yevseyev continues the tradition of the famous seto gold mines on the banks of the River Maana.
He works as a car driver at the Golden Gate Bridge near Kuva, 140 km from his home.
It’s hard work: two months in a row without working 12 hours of rest and then only ten days at home and back again.
During the three years he worked at Artellis, Anatoli has only seen gold once.
“There’s a hard way to do that: go in and thoroughly check that the wine isn’t brought, and go out so that the gold isn’t taken,” Anatoli says.
Mare Piho was talking to a local farmer in the village of Haida, who has told him a lot about his family's memories in Siberia.
The archaic culture still preserved in Siberian sets will also be influenced by home sets, as it is simply so magnificent, according to the most in-depth study of distant sets in Piho Mare.
His first trip to Siberia is 30 years later this year.
During this time, he has visited there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many stakes did you still migrate to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get the land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I'm saying 8000.
I figured it out according to the Siberian set of men's stories, who have also thought about it themselves.
It is difficult to say exactly, because at that time up to 30 people could come in one group, but the passport was given only to a man.
The passport was given only to one, but with him were children, sisters and relatives.
Look how big this territory was here!
It was several times larger than the historical Setoma.
It was necessary to educate, to manage in some way.
Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they fell into areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (salary farming), gold mining, industry.
For example, many sets went to work in the later classified city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (now the power of the Soviets built a uranium enrichment plant - J.P.) when it was formed.
Did the settlers make up the majority of the population in the area at the time?
Yes, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of marriage and multi-childhood lasted for a long time.
Seven or eight children in the family were normal.
How different is the culture of Siberian Setots and how different is it from the mother country Setots?
They are different, although what was brought here was never the same there.
They brought in a lot of people.
They did it themselves, too, but they always made a difference between what was brought and what was done here.
Climate change was strongly influenced by the traditional dress of the sets, because here it is colder.
Food has changed.
For example, in Setoma, meat was salted, but here it was just frozen.
Where are the villages of the Siberian Setots and what life is lived there? / graphic: Alari Paluots
The bond with the motherland was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now it's going to give Setumaa back there, it's going to affect them.
Those girls who have lived here in families have heard amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Setot delegation who came to Haida at the beginning of July for the Day of the Kingdom of Seto and lived in their homes for four days - J. P.
What's still here, it's amazing.
“The battle is super easy to come and go, because the city has a great location: at the railway junction and at the intersection of the roads,” says Reigo Tamm, an opera singer from Tapalt.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and culture, and pizza can be found anywhere.
Killa is a top city!
There is a small island near the White River, which runs through the city, where the killers are used to holding a jaan party.
"This beautiful place doesn't look like a train window," Reigo notes.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in these rivers, because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, you can do it!
You can have a picnic along the river and just make a romantic - you can see the flow of the river and think about life in front and behind.
I've been there with my girlfriends, too.
Tamm, from the opera house, has gone to the riverside between three bridges, practicing his arias: “That this place is near the city, perhaps no one will come to answer when their own stories are told.”
"There is a wonderful view from the mountain range to Tapale, but there are also health limits where you can run, ski in winter and play disc golf, for example - golf courses are made, the wheels can be borrowed from the sports center," Reigo says.
The old pros go there with their bikes, of course, but I haven't been able to play there yet.
You must probably invite colleague Rasmus Kull Tapale to visit because he is an experienced disc golfer and has wheels.
He's lending it to me!
Reigo and M<0xC3><0xA4>nnikum<0xC3><0xA4>gi were inseparable from their childhood.
At least during skiing hours.
There's a lot of tears left on this mountain, disappointments and wins in my sporting life.
Not to mention the broken jaws and mouths.
“The whole city is now full of construction, all of this is becoming unknown,” Reigo said.
Killing an old and tired wax building is, however, a very attractive place where summer responses are played.
I’m glad that in 2012 R.A.A.A.M’s manager M<0xC3><0xA4>rt Meos accepted my idea and came to do a summer theater with his theatre.
Although this year's theatrical season "Alexei Karenin" was just over, on 11 August the railway station "Ellu<0xC3><0xA4>rkaming" will be moved to the old Wax Museum in the 1980s.
"As of August 11-13, the days of the city of Tapa, in which there have been open home cafes in the Wax Building, and there are a number of cultural events, including a national one," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the city at the age of 91.
In a small yellow house in the middle of May 1, the museum is already in 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are very much and the information is huge," says Reigo, a place that is full of Tapa city history, most of which focuses on railways and the military.
Reigo admits that when Tapal goes through all the recommended places, the stomach will be empty for a long time, but fortunately the small town is full of cafes.
“We have such good places to eat and sitting in cafes sometimes makes you feel like you’re abroad,” he says.
Trained and young soldiers who have come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs-cafés, so sitting there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but around there is such an international society together.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we are moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping in Greece
BTV quoted the foreign ministry as saying that two Bulgarians had been arrested in Greece for illegally camping.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of people illegally camping on the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation is ongoing.
The foreign ministry told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased restrictions on free camping and are already imposing a severe fine on all those who are left to rest in a place that is not intended to do so.
Checks continue throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Dogs teach wolves to go and break the sheep.
After a year, the farmers of Hiiumaa have to give the wolves a break again from their herd of "teaching materials" - apparently the dogs taught the wolves have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
I only had the same number three, a year earlier, 124.
In sync with the breakdowns, there are also data from the environmental agency that no dog breeds were born in the land of Hiiumaa and information from the Hunting Council of Hiiumaa that two dog breeds have been fixed on the island this year.
By Monday night, the wolves in the village of Kabuna in the Emmaste Valley had broken 15 sheep and injured 18 of the remaining half of the sheep.
In the early hours of Wednesday morning, the wolves broke one sheep in the village of Reheselja and seriously injured the other, who had to be killed in an emergency.
The rules for the management of genetically modified crops must be clear.
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft Law on the Environment for Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOVS) and the Law on Amendments to the Plant Protection Act to the Coordination Circle.
With the amendment of the Act, the creation of a separate data set for both genetically modified (GM) crop sites and operators will be waived, and a plant health register will be used for this purpose.
In addition, the obligation of the operator of GM crops to have a prior agreement within the prescribed radius with the person engaged in the harvesting shall be amended.
While there is currently no cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least until it has been decided to declare Estonian GMO-free,” said Sigmar Suu, head of the Department of Plant Health at the Ministry of Agriculture.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens associated with both the private and public sectors," added Suu.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the collection and training of GM crop sites and operators in GMOVS and sets out the requirements for the management and start-up of GM crop activities.
In the specific context of the harvest, the present obligation of the GM crop grower to inform the beekeepers of the start of cultivation of the GM crop with the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement before the start of cultivation with the beekeeper.
The bill has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult this in the draft information system and, if they wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes will affect, in particular, the persons involved in the field of plant cultivation, bees and the Office for Agriculture.
In the European Union, including Estonia, it is allowed to grow only one GM crop - maize MON 810.
To date, however, none of the Estonian farmers have been interested in growing GM crops.
The reason for this is the fact that there is no maize pest in Estonia, a European stem agent for which maize strain MON 810 is resistant.
Also, the varieties of this corn line have been bred to the southern regions and this corn is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Affairs commissioned studies on the seeds of various varieties of summer rape, maize and soy grown in Estonia to detect possible contamination with GM organisms.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign and as a result of the study it was concluded that the seeds of rape, maize and soy varieties grown in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that in Estonia there is no cultivation of deliberately genetically modified crops, and it has also been confirmed that there has also been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United is recruiting Nemanja Matic as "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United have painted Nemanja Matic as a "genius" after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
For <0xC2><0xA3>40 million, the player who was bought over from Chelsea started in Dublin in United's last pre-season game before Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid in a 2-1 win over Madrid on Tuesday, posting an impression in the defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were able to walk freely on the offensive.
However, after staying away from Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was in dire need of a match form and he only held on for 45 minutes, which Mourinho said must definitely be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant mindset - he has a football mindset," Mourinho said.
"Let's help him get the form as soon as possible."
Like the Matic, other new recruits, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, also started at Aviva's starting line-up, and Mourinho began quietly setting up his own uniform starting man for the start of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wants to hire three more footballers, but he confirmed that the club has already done a "great job" by signing contracts with three of his four priority options.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to achieve three out of four," he added.
“I’m even happier if they can make four out of four, but they’ve worked hard for me.”
The next son of a bitch got to his feet on August 1st, and then Muhus.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird watcher living in S<0xC3><0xB5>rve, the first son of a whore, equipped with a transmitter in S<0xC3><0xB5>rve, and this nest is already flying around, has left the nest and joined the Mullutu-Suurlahe’s large nocturnal meeting.
This is because S<0xC3><0xB5>rves is not a fruit source, writes the Voice of the Islands.
On this Tuesday, it was already relatively late to ring the bells, another son of a whore and this on Muhu Island joined the sender.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project carried out by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Mullu was equipped with a son of a bitch named Mati with a GSM transmitter in S<0xC3><0xB5>rves T<0xC3><0xBC>rju.
"His actions are all on the internet: how he went in Spain in the winter, when he came back for a while at the border between Germany and Poland and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
British inventor glass installs a microchip in his body to access the house and car with a sink
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could simply open his front door, get into the office, and even start a car with a handrail.
Steven Northam, 33, had a small chip installed between his thumb and index finger and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, to ensure the installation procedure meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to the microchip installed on cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company also swapped the locks of houses and cars to match the chip, asking for <0xC2><0xA3>300 for a single lock.
This married one-child father has installed the technology now both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
White House Exposition Pays Thousands to Taxpayers
According to military documents published in TIME magazine, the White House decided to fly a Navy helicopter last month for an event to mark the production of the United States of America, paying taxpayers a sum of $24,000 to the south-eastern taxpayers.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, was the central draw of the event to showcase American construction programs at the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and White House senior officials renewed industrial products from all 50 states in their round.
The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was exposed together with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a twin-engined lift made in Mississippi.
According to the documents of the squadron responsible for the operation of the helicopter Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House military cabinet demanded the participation of the helicopter with FARGO for 36 hours before the helicopter was "unusual" for an event in the southern air.
"I wanted you to be aware of this, because it is an unusually high-profile event," HMX-1 commander said the day before the event in an e-mail to his commander, the Navy's deputy chief of staff in the aviation field.
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the south-east at 7 a.m. on 17 July for an event starting at 3 p.m. and would remain there until the desert was cleaned between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on the same evening.
Added was the fact that if leaving the White House should be delayed, a second crew train is needed for re-entry due to working time constraints.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the squadron's security team remained close to the aircraft during the entire stay on the ground.
From the documents given to TIME magazine, it was not possible to determine whether another crew was finally needed or not.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether a given event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told it wasn't a violation," the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have a choice," replied the commanding officer.
The White House declared the event "Made in America" an official event and Hatch's law would not have covered it.
But even the official events have political undertones.
The President supported the efforts of the health reform at the time in the Senate debate and welcomed the efforts to keep government regulations under control.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents have to use them for travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for photosynthesis is unusual.
Trump caught attention in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, caught the president’s plane in the background, and his Twitter account snarled at the messages that lamented how his predecessor used the president’s plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the 'Made in America' exhibition, which featured products from all 50 states that have been made from American materials by American workers," White House press secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
The HMX-1 teams often sample wildfires around Washington and the south of the island in order to practice the deployment to the White House of the President of the United States with a centimeter accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 held 58 rehearsals at the White House.
According to the official, the flight to the event "Made in America" was considered to be among the standard of study of that month's flight crew.
Eskadar’s helicopters flew on that day in addition to 11 hours of “non-presidential support missions.”
According to the White House, no other exponent of this event loaded the taxpayer’s wallet.
According to the representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in the organisation of exposure to the south of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not retain the president's budget documents and the exact costs of the event are difficult to determine.
But according to the Department of Defense’s 2017 annual hourly rates, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per flight hour.
Eskadar's documents indicated the flight was 30 minutes from both directions of its main naval airfield Quantico from Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is well below that amount.
“The calculation of taxpayers’ costs based on estimated compensation rates is very misleading,” Walters said.
"These estimated compensation rates include staff, maintenance and many other non-returnable costs, which will be taken into account in the case of annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the Ministry of Defence’s compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
Sean Spicer, a former White House press secretary, defended the use of a helicopter at the event.
“The point is to show things made in America this week,” Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are expected to be hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe, just like most Americans, we are all proud of that helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it’s right to highlight it.”
It is not clear whether Trump was involved in a south-facing event while riding a helicopter or not, but he sat behind the role of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump turned to representatives of Sikorsky, casting a joke on the company’s products in his personal fleet.
"I feel Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of their products."
Grit <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko - through tears came peace and joy
In 2011 MMil Daegus hit <0xC5><0xA0>adeikot in the last field, 800 m of running foot ramp and was taken away from the stadium with a milk carrier frame.
Shortly before that, he had received a zero in the distance at a university held in China.
The 2012 Helsinki European Championships were affluent, but at the 2012 London World Cup, it finished 23rd with 6013 points.
However, the failure continued.
After the opening day of the 2013 Moscow International Championships, Estonia’s record was on the chart for the long haul.
Two years later, he won 15th place in the World Cup in Beijing and filled the Olympic standard, but this was also a disappointment for the more wanted athlete.
The heaviest cadalipe was only passed through <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko with a mud, if it did not get the result at the Amsterdam E.M. in the distance.
I just want to put together one good multi-racial once or twice.
“Once upon a time,” he whispered.
It was even worse: a month later, his Olympic competition was interrupted by the first hurdle due to Rio’s hole injury.
Time has come to take off - will we continue with the 7th race at all?
Is a two-day effort worth it?
He thought for a long time, but found peace.
I had a clear mind.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I have thought that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, it was time to heal and think cleanly.
“I knew I wasn’t going to put the pill in the bag yet,” <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko says of his self-cleaning.
I got to turn the page clean and move on with the new momentum.
According to coach Anne M<0xC3><0xA4>gi, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the caregiver, but he realized that, above all, the athlete himself needs to find out.
He was so pissed off by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
“Grit said he didn’t give up and he wants to prove to himself what he’s worth,” M<0xC3><0xA4>gi says.
Now he has some kind of peace.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May when <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko set a new Estonian record of 6,280 points at the G<0xC3><0xB6>tzis multi-stakeholder competition.
In the high-level competition, he improved the personal top score by almost a metre (13.89) and ran a knockout run of record time.
Then the multi-competitor felt that this was not the law of abilities at all, but that only the first racetrack was eliminated.
He was taught for years by M<0xC3><0xA4>gi, who says that <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko is a pattern student.
He's a ready athlete, he's good at training.
When something goes wrong or wrong, he says it right away.
He knows his body and believes in his feelings.
We need to get out of this.
I can't say what exactly needs to be done and we'll follow it.
A new approach has also been found in <0xC5><0xA0>adeiko.
“I’m not the one who does the maximum in training,” he says, saying that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
A close-up baby shower will make you happy
Good emotions have also offered happiness to the loved ones.
Both his former training partner Maris M<0xC3><0xA4>gi and his sister Grete have recently become parents, and the multi-racial has received support from new compatriots.
“It’s been really interesting,” Shadeiko says.
One drink that equates to “training” the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Shepherd is such a big fan of wine that he believes that wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
His words are not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the “very active” process of tasting wine.
By smelling the glass, twisting the wine in the mouth, enjoying it, and feeling the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but taste comes from the way the wine stimulates the brain.
It compares how the brain "sees" color.
“The taste is not in wine, the taste creates the taste of wine,” says Sheperd.
For example, the things that still affect the appearance of the taste of wine are our age, gender, and even the amount of saliva produced by the person.
Sheperd, of course, realizes that wine is not to be drunk.
“There has to be more action,” he says.
If you take too large a spoon, the system is overloaded.
Excessive drinking of wine can harm the brain rather than benefit - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine risk memory loss, loss of balance, and reduced mental capacity.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less pay from colleagues
The data from HR search firm Fontes reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less pay from colleagues.
Ten percent of the wage gap is between men and women, writes the portal Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector employment survey of Fontese.
The total number of posts under the survey was 8,577.
63% of the jobs were men.
“While only three companies denied that the pay gap is for men and that there is no pay gap for the rest of the companies, in reality, compared to similar jobs, the men’s monthly base salary is on average 10% higher than the women’s average and the men’s annual salary on average is 8% higher than the men’s average.”
"Narcose" Season 3 commercial clip: now that Pablo Escobar has gone, Netflix's hit series takes center stage in Cali cartel
Despite the fact that the second season of Narcose revealed the killer of Pablo Escobar, the Netflix series is not far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first of them has already been completed with an ad clip that teases the series with new villains.
In season three, the DEA turns its attention to the world’s richest drug trade organization – the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful Christians “like a Fortune 500 company”, simply with more taxes on government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the cartel leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is the brain of the cartel, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Amman) is the head of relations with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In the newly released ad clip, Pedro Pascal returns to Javier Penana, a character who enlists U.S. and Colombian legal aid in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matthias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcose will open on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the U.N. Afghanistan mission said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Relief and Works Mission, said hundreds of women were running for local council elections, three women were running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters were women.
“It is not possible to overemphasize the role of women by emphasizing the importance of women,” she said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent and be credible to the people only if women are fully involved and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The elections and presidential elections of the local councils of Afghanistan will be held on April 5.
The Taliban has threatened, on its own, an election process that coincides with a transition period when the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year’s election marks the first time that power has been peacefully handed over from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysomi, women have a strong role to play in the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, there are 1.2 million women out of 3.6 million registered voters.
The joy of sharing makes everything both large and small more intense.
There is always too little time in common, but with the excitement of training gives a good opportunity to combine the meeting, the game, the proximity and the load.
And whatever a convenient solution - wherever you cruised in the summer, the lively artisans will always be with you and remember with their little voice impatiently: "Let's do the exercise now too!"
Start with the warm-up - very good is the usual gold game or along the beach.
The owl is the base of the foot and the stern - who would like to take the shape of a sandbox blown from the waves during the summer?
Imetore is to use nails instead of children!
First of all, it is safe and comfortable, the difficulty increases gradually at the same pace as the coach's strength.

Plank is an extraordinary, but hopelessly boring exercise for the child.
But it’s easy to make it more fun!
Game board: Take a long plank column, from which repeat to touch.
In fact, it is more difficult than usual, but much more fun to do when in the meantime you can give a friend a hand.
To add a load, you can stay in the fold, on a small pedestal, and also walk around in this position.
For additional skill, a smaller child can sit on the hips, but this exercise provides fun for all children.

A trip from the Philippines to the heart of fashion enthusiasts
Hand-stitched bags are a summer classic, which has become a hit product of its own in recent years, which one of the right summer wearers has to hang out at the top of his hand and which traders have been able to match despite its modest origin to the hit's price tag.
A bag that is reddish in color is probably one of those things that has existed once in a lifetime and whose possession has not caused any special emotions.
It's just there and if it's not, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, the shoulder bags are making a real win and the fashion enthusiasts have changed their fine designer bags into summer months instead of simple shoulder-lined bags.
However, it is not only a beach bag, but today it is just as popular as a street bag and even more courageous women walk to the office with it.
Here, however, it is worth clarifying first whether such a summer look to the boss still sits or is worth the wet and the laptop, however, to throw a little more formal sumadan.
Interference has made shoulder bags a real summer love for women.
For example, when reading foreign furniture blogs, the first thing to keep in mind is that on a holiday trip the Moegurmans prove first thing to the local market, and they call themselves some shoulder bag, on which the whole holiday season will be faithful, and which will be accompanied by a beach on the beach, on the beach and on the river.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a larger stack of bags from the market and sell or hand them out to their loyal readers.
It should be noted, however, that the demand for bags among readers is so great that in the real world women (and men!) would probably go hand in hand to each other to become the happy owner of a home.
In some ways, such madness is also understandable, because it is rare for them to be able to buy something that has risen to a high level in fashion for just a few euros.
Indeed, planners have also discovered a simple money-making opportunity here, and so the finest luxury brands sell beer bags for some time and thousands of euros.
Probably still in order for the richer customers not to feel like simple-minded people walking around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana a shoulder bag worth over a thousand euros.
For the interpretation of Chanel’s shoulder bag, however, it can go out in the 6000 euro round.
Unlike most fashionistas, however, the shoulder bags do not come from some great fashionistas, but their story became a far cry from the beginning.
In fact, shoulder bags are said to have originated far from the Philippines, from which they have been widely worn.
There is a slight bulging of the house, especially the exporiatory and the locals walking around with them very often do not see.
It is said to have originated from the 14th century and is quite related to the normal wear and tear.
However, since the shoulder bag does not need to be as strongly reddened as the basket, patterns and other materials can be stitched into them, which make the bag more personal and therefore also more attractive.
For example, recently there have been particularly trendy bags, where there have been reddish colored furs or leather scarves.
The thank-you note can be sent to actress Jane Birkin, who has never seen the biggest reddish shoulder bag fan before.
It was he who fitted the shoulder bag to all kinds of outfits and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
Nowadays, the popularity of bags does not play a smaller role, but also the fact that taking care of them is a flower head and, unlike all sorts of other Sumadans, they do not have to be cared for by special means, but it is also caused by water and wet towels.
As in the case of trend wearers, brands have come out with all kinds of interpretations beyond the classic look.
For example, if you want, you can buy yourself a ribbed or rather a thin shoulder strap.
However, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but a shoulder strap does.
But what is the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries it has been considered classically such a bag made of shoulders, reminiscent of its style basket, is open on top and has short, as well as shoulders, bangs.

GMB worries about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The company is awaiting confirmation of long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant from the cookie manufacturer's managers at McVitie.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent about the investment of the Tollcross facility in the future.
More than 500 people work in a factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea are produced, as well as other products.
Pladis, owner of McVitie, said they have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the facility over the past few years.
Employees and union presidents were hired there "to be the first to hear" if something changes in the factory's operations.
In a letter sent to the company's head of object, GMB Scotland addressed McVitie's request "to raise concerns that funding will not be used to modernise production lines".
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we can’t get an explanation from the head of the facility about Tollcross’s business needs and future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned.
It has worked for families of several generations, and the workforce consists largely of the local community and the people of the Glasgow area, being necessary to provide more support for decent employment in an area where there is high unemployment and social exclusion.
Therefore, in terms of jobs, wages and welfare in the eastern part of Glasgow, and in the context of Brexit, the rise in living costs and the chronic decline in production, the company needs McVitie to grow rapidly."
A spokesman for Pladise said: "The head of the Tollcross facility received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company responds directly to it because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting was held at Tollcross between employees and GMB representatives, where several issues were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the employees that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our activities - and this applies to all of our companies and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross facility, most of which have gone into production lines and improved operations.
We fully understand Tollcross as the legacy of the production facility and if there are any changes in the operation of the facility, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about Neymar’s approach?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain does not succumb to attempts to lure Neymar into his ranks, making an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million for his expulsion. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record-breaking conquest?
This tempting approach has opened up the summer window and the Ligue 1 club is poised to break more than twice the current world record for overtaking, set last season by Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
Once the transition is complete, Neymar will become the world’s most expensive player and also the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, who will start to get paid more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week after paying PSG.
Barcelona is angry at both the approach and the break-up of Neymar, although a source close to the Catalans' board confirms that the club has always been the best care for football since its arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world of such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi strongly warned all clubs that are considering hiring some of the best PSG players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll take them in and connect with those players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to make a deal with one of our players, they have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line, as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italians to leave under any conditions and that Barcelona could receive a setback as a result of this interest, losing one of its expensive assets in the form of Neymar.
Ireland wants to build a bridge after Brexit, not a border.
“Brexit is threatening to seriously strike a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, the UK and Ireland,” Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June.
“I can’t imagine who would benefit from it,” he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects have made possible the free movement of current people and goods, Varadkar said.
“This is our vision for the future: to build a bridge, not a border,” he said.
Mr Varadkar said he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and because he cannot, to remain part of the European single market.
It would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another option to make Britain’s departure more smooth would be the creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish prime minister said.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "Surely we could have such an agreement with the UK".
The alternative would be to return to customs offices, which would declare a historic disintegration and a political failure.
“Come to trade, prosperity and peace,” the Irish prime minister said.
He called Brexit a "challenge of our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of Northern Ireland’s main parties in Belfast.
March Avandi, who passed his first half-length triathlon, said Ironman can pass anyone.
Today, in the winter capital Otep<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4>, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held, when the half-time Ironman competition was attended by about a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries.
The 70.3-mile distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, the first triathlon of his life also ended in victory by M<0xC3><0xA4>rt Avand.
“I thought it was going to be difficult and it was going to be difficult,” Avandi said.
Despite the complexity, Avandi states that in fact, triathlon is accessible to everyone.
"It's not the distance that kills, it's the pace that kills," he said, hinting that at a fast pace, everyone gets to the finish line.
Except for Ott Sepp: “It’s okay with the physical, but he can’t swim.”
Avandi had been practicing agaral since February.
Starting 4-5 hours a week, but then 10 hours a week.
With a time of 5:34:12, he reached 270th overall.
Although Avandi lost to both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "prominent class" races.
Last year, Tanel Padar, a "good example person", lost to Avand in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45 respectively).
The winner of the Otep<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> men's count of the Ironman series was crowned by the German Johannes Molda with a time of 3:58:27, the best of the Estonians was Ivo Suur with a time of 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Danish Helle Frederiksen won with a time of 04:24:01, while the Estonian Maria J<0xC3><0xA4>nese, who lost to Frederiksen in about half an hour and got a time of 04:58:58.
Avandi spent 1.9 km of swimming distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in 410.
