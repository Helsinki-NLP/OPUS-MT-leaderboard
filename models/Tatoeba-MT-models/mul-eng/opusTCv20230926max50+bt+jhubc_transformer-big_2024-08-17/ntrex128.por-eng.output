Members of the Assembly of Wales fear "passing through Maretas"
There is a dismay on the part of some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) regarding the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Deputies of the Welsh Parliament).
The source of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Parliament of Wales".
Some members of this assembly, coming from all political colors, were afraid that such would cause them to fall into ridicule.
A working AM said the group is concerned about the fact that "the designation rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For non- Welsh readers: in Welsh, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excretions".
A Plaid AM said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative MP said the group was "open-minded" about the name change, but said the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a pronunciation similar to the letter u in English of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the Assembly are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave its assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which registered widespread support for the proposal to designate the assembly as the 'Gales Parliament'.
On the question of the title of the AMs, the Commission favoured "Deputies of the Welsh Parliament", or WMP, but the MWP option was most favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to bring the consensus together may be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is due to present a draft legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the Assembly carries out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AMs and the configuration of the commission system.
When they debate legislation, the AMs will have the final say on the question of how they should be designated.
Macedonians will refer to the change of the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to "North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which integrates a province with the name Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its neighbor’s name in the north constitutes a complaint about its territory, having repeatedly raised objections to its requests to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is nothing more than the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's Sins Fall silent at a time when Harlem churches are fighting for survival
“From a historical perspective, the elderly I spoke to told me that there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, was understandable.
“People socialize differently,” he said.
“Bars have ceased to be the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly go.”
As for the churches, he is concerned about the possibility that the money gained from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that sooner or later everything will return exactly to the point of departure.
The churches, he added, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the type of people who will not support the sanctuaries of the neighborhood that still remain.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and, therefore, such will hasten the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, as it is unlikely that most of those who move to these complexes will join these congregations.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation came out of here in the 1930s.
The building was later laid down by a black congregation that carried out its worships in the vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street retailers, a major shopping street in Harlem that resisted hiring and promoting black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged. However, when they made plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson’s parishioners ordered the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the chariot "the bells of the poor".
The expert who touched the carriage in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and an "unreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also reported that it was the world’s first black musician Dionysio A. Lind to be played, who moved to the largest hall in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened at St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought in by the church's lay leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the parish’s governing body composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that it “would seek to pass on the costs to you”, unfortunately the fact that it has not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark causes injuries to 13-year-old teenager in a lobster hunt in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster hunt in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour as he heard the boy scream for help, then rowed in his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just an enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but later realized the boy was screaming "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The whole area of the clavicle was torn apart, Hammel described what he observed when he arrived at the boy.
“I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the trunk.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with large warehouse-style cosmetics sections, backed by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain market share in the UK cosmetics market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which has continued to grow as fashion clothing and home goods sales decline, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be rolled out in its latest year.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the demand on the part of supermarkets for ways to use exhibition space once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its catalog of beauty products with the offering of up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oréal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand areas similar to those of Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its range of boutique make-up so that most products obey vegan precepts, something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week. The second, in Selly Oak, Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and changing food shopping habits to small daily quantities in nearby stores have led to supermarkets now having to work harder to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses, at a time when the supermarket chain is trying to combat discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has been installing Argos sales points in hundreds of stores, having also installed a series of Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, and claims that it has strengthened sales of merchandise and made acquisitions more profitable.
The company’s previous attempt to renew its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from health product stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmacy business three years ago with 281 points of sale to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Commercial Director, said: "We have transformed the look and essence of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the client.
Our range of brands has been designed to suit all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones ‘crazy’ after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has become “crazy” after TV presenter Holly Willoughby left a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for the brand of items for home and accessories Truly.
The deal had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she would leave the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons star Den Peter Jones alive by abandoning the lucrative brand at the last minute to focus on her highly profitable new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones got “crazy” when the TV golden girl admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (whose value could be as high as <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million) would allow her time to quit.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was taking a plane to one of his holiday homes abroad.
A source said: “True was by far Holly’s greatest priorities.
It would mean the resolution of your future in the long run and would be financial support for the next two decades.
His decision to leave has left everyone absolutely shocked.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... was so close to the launch.
There’s a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at headquarters in Marlow.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, who is among Britain’s most lucrative vedas, could cost the company millions, given the steep investment in products, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and articles for the home, and the potential for additional delays in the launch.
In addition, it may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
The couples vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity at ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night that "We don't intend to comment on your business."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
The U.S. president jokingly mentioned the criticism that he would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would consider “unworthy of a president” and for revealing such a positive attitude to the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, in his faked voice, that he was a “telejournalist.”
"I didn't give in to anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, stressing that it would be a major step in North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations for denuclearization are dragging on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding response" from the US to the first steps towards disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
"It's running very well with North Korea," he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this excellent relationship.”
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results: the end of missile tests, support for the release of hostages, and the return to the country of the deadly remains of U.S. military personnel.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when speaking in relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on an island, causing the deaths of hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had been displaced, it was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for the international aid pipeline.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, it has been clear to state that they are not seeking international assistance; therefore, it becomes a little difficult,” Ms. Sumbang said.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team that will head to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although they were built in Aceh, shelters against tsunamis are not commonly seen on other shorelines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palu, to a bad degree the validity of a warning, had contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, traveling between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of earthquakes is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of this new calamity.
President Joko Widodo, who has made improvements to the infrastructure decrypts a central part of his election campaign, has spent huge amounts on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has plagued Mr. Joko’s executive, at a time when he faces his re-election next year.
The president is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of his faith.
More than 1,000 people have died and tens of thousands have been displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge makes a long stop for Chelsea's tie goal
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters from Chelsea's beacon, with his team losing 1-0.
He gave a touch to his left before making a stop towards the second traves.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed to the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arrizabalaga in flight and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to reach that position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq are moving as far as possible, so I was just winning as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I gave a touch and I didn't think too much about it. I just finished it."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the interval after scoring a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this game, the forward of the blues gave a kickback pass to Mateo Kovacic before disembarking near the midfield and sprinting towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick midfield pass.
Then he made a nice stop that crossed the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the big area.
He overstepped the defenses and scored against the net of the second travesty with a left-footed finish that went through Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at three o’clock on Wednesday afternoon at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at three o’clock Thursday afternoon in London.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country’s disaster response agency said on Sunday.
There are reports describing a large number of people trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters high, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, at a news conference.
The town of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of the buildings that collapsed.

A number of police officers were highlighted inside the cordon to monitor the apartment building.
We ask those who have information that you contact by DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 indicating registration 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament became the most recent monument engulfed by the contention of "historic revisionism"
His removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for his destruction, reminiscent of the Taliban's perpetration of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that in the current debate on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s figure next to the Palace of Westminster would become a target to shoot down.
The iconoclast of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testimony of 19th-century opinion and part of historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of homage.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes a fully accurate description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety representing one side of that division.
Their successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and celebration.”
Pork killer attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut artery and covered in blood, near a well on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, read in the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to an open neighboring well.
In that well, he said, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 227-pound pig had attacked the pig farmer until his death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and crushed,” said the cousin, referred to by his nickname “Wu,” according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to prevent it from attacking other people while police collected evidence at the scene.
Reports say Yuan’s family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their fifth in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig immobilized a Welsh farmer against his tractor until the woman managed to scare the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can act as a “stimulus.”
"They're just playing.
They like to fight, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them the respect they deserve,” he said.
Residues of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring widespread heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains to the entire northern Mexican and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
At 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, Rosa caused 137 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
However, it begins to take shape a depression over the Pacific Ocean that moves to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Baja California Peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical moisture northward into the southwestern zone of the United States.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At this time, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching depression will produce widespread strong rains in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain can cause dangerous sudden flooding, drenched with debris and possibly land leases in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall that can reach 5 to 7 mm in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected in southwestern areas, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding with rapidly worsening conditions is possible, due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is highly advised to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rain.
Strong precipitation can cause the walkers to turn into wild rivers and the troubadours will bring strong pointy winds and clouds of dust.
The impending depression will bring with it heavy rainfall over parts of the southern California coastline.
Total rainfall of more than 12 mm is possible, which can cause small landslides of debris and slippery roads.
This may be the first precipitation of the wet season in the region.
Some tropical rainwaters will begin to occur in Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday, before rain becomes more scattered at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread at the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
The month of October can record strong temperature variations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools down. However, the tropical zones will remain quite mild.
Sometimes, this leads to drastic changes in temperature in short distances.
There is an excellent example of the drastic temperature differences across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a nearly 11 degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the persistent summer heat will tend to increase and expand again.
A large part of the central and eastern U.S. zone is expected to have a hot start in October, with temperatures ranging from 27 to 30 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States by the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations yesterday the gripping testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political deadlock continued, with the stations shutting down regular programming due to a last-minute twist: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh slapped her while she was drunk and tried to kick her out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, said he is absolutely certain that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people, a number Nielsen said on Friday, are likely to have attended the hearing.
The company accounted for the average number of viewers in the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The numbers from the other stations that broadcast it were not yet available, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen generally has difficulty measuring audiences of those who see programs in offices.
To give some perspective, this is a level of hearing similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscars ceremony.
The Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave its strong support to Kavanaugh's nomination, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day audience, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
Next comes CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million, and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen reported.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican cabinet issued a statement stating that his vote would be in Kavanaugh's favor, the senator was caught by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning to be verbally attacked by protesters when he tried to enter an elevator to address a hearing with Juis.
The senator remained motionless to look at the floor while he was being criticized directly for CNN cameras.
"I'm here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that “you have power while so many women have no power.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closes, that it would have more to say at the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event live hours later, when the Judiciary Commission voted to have Kavanaugh's appointment proceed to a Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee over the next week, which the Democratic minority had come to demand.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with a few other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, as it was evident that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'making politics' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "making politics" with Britain's future and of harming the national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with the newspaper’s front page, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the minister’s “Chequers Plan” for Brexit, stating that a proposal that envisages Britain and the EU cover tariffs elsewhere is “absurd.”
Wayde Sims murder: police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson of LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, according to a statement from the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, with police saying Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered them at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, news to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he had fatally hit Wayde with a firearm.
A $350,000 bond was established, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge parish medical-legal office issued a preliminary report saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head extending to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police Action Group, the state police criminal lab, Southern University police and residents of the area who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local authorities for their “dignity and effort to get justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
This forward, 1.98 m tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastating" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This is what we’re constantly worried about,” Wade said.
Volcano ejects ash in Mexico City
Ashes emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the neighborhoods south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Sunday advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in a 24-hour space.
The center detected numerous loud noises and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gray covering car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in volcanic activity, located 72 kilometers from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked Mexico’s central zone in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independent protesters and the intervention police, while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, trapped by the intervention police, hit her with eggs and threw paint into dust, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Later clashes also took place, in which the police resorted to barricades to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independent groups chanting "We do not forget, we do not forgive" faced Unionist protesters, shouting "Long life for Spain".
Fourteen people have received treatment for minor injuries suffered in the protests, it can be read in the local press.
Tensions remain high in the region prone to independence, a year after the October 1 referendum that was considered illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although the influx to the polls had been low, with a majority boycott of those against.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the ongoing vote at polling stations spread across the region, resulting in violent clashes.
The independent groups had camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
Although it was held, this demonstration was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes of Catalonia becoming independent.
“Last year, we had our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for being able to vote, but now we are blocked,” he said.
Despite having achieved a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have had difficulty keeping pace this year, with their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who registered the protest in support of the police with his mobile phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“It’s becoming more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders arrested awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament in next year’s elections.
“Presenting myself as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we see on the part of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crash against a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly slammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7.30 p.m., British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
At some point, someone may also have shot a beast against the car.
Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, stunned the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of just two in 18 games as Ibrox's club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changed level, with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard’s team, which continues without a home win in the first division this season, faces the Hearts leaders, with an additional eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
However, Livingston extended his succession of undefeated games to six games in the division, with head coach Holt not losing once since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Loses Opportunities Against Disturbed Visitors
Holt's team was supposed to have advanced to the scoreboard long before the goal, as the incisive character of his game was causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson stepped into the defense, but let himself be dragged in front of the beacon and then Alan Lithgow only managed to direct his effort away after he fainted to find Craig Halkett's header on the beacon.
The home team was delighted to let the Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause problems for visitors in the stopped ball games.
And that's how the crucial goal came about.
The Rangers granted a free pass and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, who gave a touch and scored from the center of the large area.
At that point, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but faced a defense of the impenetrable home team, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet, and Lithgow gave a touch away from Livingston's other stop ball game.
They continued to come across the large area of Livingston, which were successively resolved, and two complaints of great penalty, one after Halkett's investment on substitute Glenn Middleton and another after a hand, were refused by the referee.
Livingston "phenomenal" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, from BBC Scotland, at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations in this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for how he galvanized the 11th since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall to their full throughout the game.
However, the Rangers showed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality sometimes demonstrated with Gerrard, the team fell far short of these standards.
Their final play was uninspired (only once they managed to open the home team), constituting a kind of warning for the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an is received in an ambiguous way in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, whose goal was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The difference involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then went to the Colony to inaugurate a new and gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of its country.
Police have allege security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters have indicated a presence in the vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard, condemning both the president’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street with Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, near 10:15, British summer time.
The driver of the car stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died at the scene.
The collision comes months after the death of another cyclist in a runaway collision on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were trying to identify the person and inform their family members.
Barriers and deviations were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the prison cabinet said.
The unrest, which still continues, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. British summer time on Saturday.
Special "Tornado" agents have been summoned to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the Prison Services said: “Specially trained teams have been used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they may spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a detainee.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were summoned to solve a serious disturbance in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (areas affected by drought may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it’s exactly what’s expected early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert, implying the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday, for southern and eastern Nevada, southern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct trajectory over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the end of Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression within a radius of 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts that can reach 15 mm in the Arizona Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin can receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals that can reach 10 mm.
For those who are not affected by the risks of sudden flooding, the Rosa rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently being affected by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second most severe category,” the site reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the continental mass across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still with hurricane force on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is located 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, so it is weakening.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or at the fall of Monday night.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"Total rainfall is expected from 8 to 10 mm from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with maximum possible 25 mm," the weather.com website said in a statement.
Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. This will then head south of Utah in the last hours of Tuesday night.
“The main expected danger from Rosa or her remains is the very high rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the southwestern U.S. Desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to produce sudden floods and drenched with debris in the deserts, with a risk of life, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, near 4am, British summer time, on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police from Avon and Somerset said.
The agents appealed to anyone who may have mobile footage of the incident that they are presenting.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "victim of the Democratic Party's malice and anger"
“A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "victim of the Democratic Party's malice and anger" during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, having vigorously and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified in the hearing about his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage" on that day.
“A vote of confirmation by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum,” he told the crowd of supporters of West Virginia.
The president later referred to Kavanaugh’s appointment when he spoke about the importance of the Republican influx to the polls in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not competing, but I’m actually competing,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere to fight for excellent candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party deputy told CNN.
Hundreds of earthquake and tsunami deaths in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of them dragged by the gigantic waves that hit the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high hit the beach at dusk, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred in the wake of a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, having been victims of the incident," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency to mitigate the impact of Indonesia's (BNPB) disasters in a statement in Jacar.
“The tsunami did not move alone: it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Public aerial photographs by the agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be shaken by replicas on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's huge swing was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the tsunami dimension, the statement reads.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the derelict buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally disabled and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading for the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves appeared at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video posted on social media, one can see a man on the upper floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, for people on the street below.
In a space of minutes, a water wall fell on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power outage that disrupted communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities. However, the evacuees still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo marked a visit to Palau evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is rising exponentially to more than 800.
It's very bad.
Although it has managed to safely reach the city of Palu, where employees are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of their offices, the staff of Donggala’s World Vision have been through scenes of devastation on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began to begin the grim task of assisting the victims of the disaster, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and foreign personnel can only have access to the site if it is declared a "national disaster zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still at a level of provincial catastrophe,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says ‘OK, this is a national catastrophe’ we can open the door to international assistance, but this status does not yet exist.”
As the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the still missing still maintained the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that attenuate the dark headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a ditch.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, head coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior paraglider practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel began circulating among the paragliding community, he sent messages on WhatsApp to the athletes of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a gray check mark, rather than a pair of blues.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who refueled an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department statement.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the amusement complex and preparing to introduce more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “came running behind the Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money that was destined for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “To be previously known by Kanye West.”
West, 41, received Ye's nickname some time ago and used it as the title of her eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
At the same time an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, when he commented on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, we are us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the one", to only Ye - being only a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known alternately by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphen and capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO pledges not to resort to military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged not to use military force against civilians, at a time when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
Militants fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a death toll that may have risen to 300, when leftist student movements were deployed across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting them monthly grants to those who study and opening more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into gangs of criminals.
U.S. Should Double Funding for Artificial Intelligence
At a time when China is stepping up its artificial intelligence business, the U.S. is expected to double spending on research in that area, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional in the Kai-Fu Lee area, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government departments have made AI-related announcements, although the country does not have a global formal strategy on the matter.
However, China presented its plan last year: it aims to lead innovation in AI by 2030.
“Duplicating the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so behind the U.S. and we are looking for the new AI revolution,” Lee said.
Duplicating funding could double the chances of AI’s next major success being achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated Othello's top-ranked American player. Later, he held executive roles at Microsoft Research and was president of Google's China branch.
Lee gave credit to previous U.S. government technology contests such as the Robotics Challenge of the Department of Defense Agency for Advanced Research Projects and asked when he would be next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to make a big effort to get state funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s stealing academic leaders; it’s companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university luminaires to work in AI.
Lee said changes to immigration policies could also help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of AI.
“I am of the opinion that green cards should be automatically granted to AI PhD students,” he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Chinese Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month a $2 billion investment in an AI Next-designated initiative.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not advanced in months.
Macedonian voters vote in referendum on changing the country's name
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on the change of the country's name to "North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists that its northern neighbor’s name represents a complaint about its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal of a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the mostly Slavic Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the influx to the polls will be enough to meet the 50% needed for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question was: “Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue the admission efforts in bodies with the EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no record of irregularities until one afternoon.
However, the influx was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters attended to vote.
“I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a constituent of the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in the referendum on changing the country’s name, which would open the doors for their accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and for the EU, but we want to join with a raised head and not through the door of service,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can address others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said the entry into NATO will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
According to him, a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, which is less than the necessary influx.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the affluence must be more than 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major setback in pro-Western government policy since it took power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero crosses Brighton's entire defence towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling forgot Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win against Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his goal in the 65th minute.
The advanced Argentinian got a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the game.
He made a sprint between three Brighton defences before cutting to reach open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He finished one defense before neutralising more in the race on the outskirts of the Brighton area.
He then made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The advanced Englishman used his first touch in the large area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-hand end.
“Aguero is having a debate with some problems on his feet,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League clash.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball right in Brighton's territory in that game.
He made a pass over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave a few touches before driving Sterling towards the second travesty.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net immediately before sliding out of the field limits.
City faced Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make life difficult for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the final, there was not much reason to force another start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to enter the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications relative to the final for the Rockies, who hold a lead in a game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still plan to secure their first division title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can get into the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the maximum level I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in these conditions?”
The Nationals have yet to announce the headline launcher for Sunday, but there are some who say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the launches in this situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, held a session at the bullpen on Thursday and would launch in his normal position on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander goes 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holding a rally in West Virginia
The president later referred to the situation involving his choice to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of Republican influence in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ... I’m not competing, but I’m competing and that’s why I’m everywhere fighting for excellent candidates.”
Trump continued, “You’re seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you’re seeing it happen right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using all the necessary means. Do they see evil, deafness?
It doesn’t matter who they attack, who they have to go through to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give.”
The Democrats, he said, have the mission of “resisting and obstructing.”
“And they’ve seen this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “aggressive, evil, sordid and lying.”
The president referred by the name Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, having received vague sounds from the public.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you run away from the document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, um no, I, wait, one - that was a body language even bad - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant of those who openly give their opinion
When the Momentum activists of my local party organization voted to censor me, it was no surprise to me.
In the end, I am the latest in a series of Labour Members in Parliament who have been told they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was the target of a similar treatment because he resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues in relation to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday mentioned that “we intend the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in Parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of a “more kind and kind” policy has long been forgotten, if it has ever materialized.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that every opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable by party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy took the lead, as the colleagues with whom he thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect me to turn around and take positions with which I would never agree - either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn’t really matter what I say), there’s a stream of insults on social media that appeal to the “fire,” denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I shouldn’t belong to the Labour Party.
And it's not just me who's going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are addressed to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never fall back before them.
One of the aspects that most disappoint me in this era of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with every motion of “censorship” or change of the rules of selection the party narrows its views.
I have received numerous advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head low, not to be so expressive, and that thus "would be all right" for me.
But that's not why I came here to do politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the negligence of Thatcher’s government that left my school’s classroom literally in ruins, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a self-employed person or as a minister in the government.
I never hid my policies, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country heads for a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Nottingham Momentum; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of "satisfaction" or political files will prevent me from acting in the sense of what I believe are the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late rehearsals somehow envied the result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one out of ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the home team take the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and remain unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The merit goes to Ayr. They've managed the risks better than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayr on the front, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, ceded to the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to give expression to the numbers, having Jason Baggot not converted to a prov.
Climo extended the advantage of Ayr with a great penalty, before, immediately before the half-time, having scored and then converted a ground test to put the scorer at 17-5 for Ayr at the interval.
However, Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
A long interruption followed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was transported from maca to the outside and, after the restart, the Ayr strengthened the lead with a trial by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Ayr's current captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted Bruce Colvine test at the end of an intense pressure inverted test.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for dropping Climo without the ball in the penalty shootout, MacPherson put the ball on the ground behind Ayr's advancing maul.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately following the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent wingman Gregor Henry for the fifth home team rehearsal.
Still Game star ready for a new career in the restoration business
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears ready to enter the restoration industry after learning that he has been appointed director of a licensed restoration company.
The 56-year-old actor portrays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and shares with longtime comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the ninth season, which will premiere soon, will be the last in the series, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was intending to engage in the "floating Glasgow restoration business."
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, a landlocked country, hopes the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a rope-covered naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue-sea flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
Receiving it is a duty.”
All over Bolivia, a landlocked country, is still alive the memory of a lost coastline for Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century, as well as the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at the highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and of course there is a positive perspective on the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will witness the passing of the TIJ’s ruling on giant screens scattered across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will deliberate in favor of their country’s claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign outing to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous Bolivian president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” the president said last August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that little would change even if it did not.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no powers to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the judgment of the TIJ is delivered only six months after the hearing of the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have hurt it.
“The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined some Chilean residual goodwill, he suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision process was unusually quick.
Next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a possibility to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political mule.
“Bolivia will never be deprived of its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to go beyond the past.”
North Korea says there will be no disarmament without the country trusting the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation would never give up its nuclear weapons if it didn’t trust Washington first.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises it made during a summit in Singapore among leaders of rival countries.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart impasse nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after Singapore’s summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "impossible dream" to consider that the continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration that puts an end to the Korean war will eventually lead the North to kneel.
Washington is afraid to accept the statement without Pyongyang taking significant first steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are aiming for a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism as to how Pyongyang actually intends to reduce an arsenal that the country probably views as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats en route to a shop near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or fully protect yourself from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the runway a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which left the style set at Paris Fashion Week amazing.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very little practical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the runway.
Valentino’s most prominent piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a broad tab similar to a feather that flooded the head of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-engraved melons, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple, although they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in time for the carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with high seams.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tubes and glasses, while the other looked like a melted ice cone.
And if you want to continue this huge statement of fashion, you're in luck.
The stylists predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
Oversized hats appear effervescent on the path of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm tab that has been used by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very little practical hat that has spread through social networks has sent another great creation to the runways: a straw beach bag almost as big as the actual model of bath that carried it.
The raffia bag in burnt orange color, adorned with raffia stripes and with a white leather grip, was the highlight of Jacquemus’ 2019 spring-summer La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing great hats and beach bags arrive in stores next summer. Since the designer has had so much impact, it would be hard to ignore the search for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Linguistic Competences are Essential for Global Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, with this trend continuing in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students spread throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to obtain the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for the deepening of their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of conceiving and implementing a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought after topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we talk to him in his own language, we can get into his heart.”
This quote reminds us that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year’s recent exams, we have verified that the languages are at the top of the table, with the highest utilization rates of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum rating of A.
These data, collected in the 74 schools below the SCIS level, show that 72% of students obtained the maximum grade of A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This demonstrates that independent Scottish schools are promoting foreign languages as vital competences that will unquestionably serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now viewed in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the curriculums of independent schools and not only.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Competences concluded that, among the reasons for employers’ difficulty in filling vacancies, 17% related to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities requiring language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with an aptitude for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit ratio of 15%.
Therefore, investing now in language teaching is important for today’s children.
The domain of several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children with better chances of finding employment with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK by the 2020 horizon, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in independent schools, supported by specialist teaching staff in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the necessary skills for success, whatever the future holds for them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so it is necessary to reflect it in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this option with diversity and excellence for young Scots.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron starts at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is coming to an end for fans who want to see LeBron James start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will take part in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you will play is still to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was questioned about his plans for the Lakers' six-game calendar in the pre-season.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump’s rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump starts a round of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the pending conformation vote for his chosen Supreme Court vacancy, Trump intends to bolster support for the midterm elections to be held soon, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is set for 7 p.m., Eastern Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below on a live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week’s hearings to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, who have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate confirmation vote will be on hold for a week as the FBI investigates.
However, the main goal of this stream of rallies is to help Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, gain some momentum.
Trump’s campaign officials said the five rallies next week are intended to “give energy to volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is as fundamental to the president’s agenda as he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the turmoil of the campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman said in a statement.
Marked for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening rally could attract supporters “from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage of the Pittsburgh area media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey in the West Virginia Senate, at a disadvantage in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates it has the strength to fight to keep hopes alive before Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing of the momentum is a totally invented sports concept, but it is one in which players truly believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum will come now?
“They had a six-point advantage and now they’re four, so we’re looking at this as a bit of a boost, I would say,” Jordan Spieth said as he was leaving the field at the end of the day.
Europe is at an advantage, of course, with four points ahead and with twelve more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three points in four.
Spieth has been a tee-to-green killer and is leading by example.
Those guttural cheers were getting louder as the round went on, with a crucial putt that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt that won the game in the 15th produced a similar cry, the kind that reveals that he still believes the American team continues in the competition.
“We just need to focus and worry about our own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed reveal of the Ryder Cup.
The European couple, unlikely but adorable, is four out of four and can’t go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only duet not to do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
In this series, given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, the idea is consolidated that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there is no more popular player to seal a potential European victory over the sun at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the discourse on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of this morning’s fourballs, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine put the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they were never close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see closely because of the interactions between partners, the advice they give or not, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better in the team so far and has gained a significant edge in the final day, however, this foursomes session has also shown that the US team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted it had.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last day of the Ryder Cup with a clear advantage after leaving the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday’s matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The duo inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a Tiger Woods with difficulties to reach the four-point classification at Le Golf National so far.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, struggling to preserve the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes with two games won, but failed to shorten the downside.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's singles on the 12th to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row when he and Molinari, who received the nickname of "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are just the only duet to win four points in their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the lead, defeating an energy-free Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who dragged on for two games on Saturday, revealed occasional access to genius, but has already lost 19 of the games he played in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third ranked in the world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a slight breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always bring the best.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of major men's tournaments, and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
The duet earned a 2&1 brave win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has reversed a four-point downside before the singles, although the title-holder team of Furyk only needs to tie to retain the trophy.
After two days in second place, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says “don’t think” of a unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was worsening distrust toward the United States and that there was no way the country could unilaterally dispense with its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear testing center and the commitment to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technologies.
“However, we don’t see any corresponding U.S. response,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way we can proceed with our disarmament first.”
Although Ri has recycled North Korean complaints already known about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, within which North Korea would be rewarded as it takes gradual steps, its statements appear to be significant in the extent that they do not reject the unilaterally binding injunctions.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between an acting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump offered assurances to North Korea security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States claims Pyongyang has first abandoned its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, opposing even the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream of people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the prolongation of sanctions is worsening our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party concerned in this matter were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that guiding North Korea’s rockets toward U.S. territory was inevitable after Trump called Kim “the man of the rockets” on a mission in pursuit.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year had threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, filled Kim with praise for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until the denuclearization denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timetable for such, saying that “if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to tighten the funding of North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit has not been well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, although North Korea later denounced him for "making demands of gangsters."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States "takes appropriate action".
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they were looking for were the security guarantees Trump had taken in Singapore, as well as initiatives aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course that teaches them to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all of its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the macho culture of studying in “directs” impregnated with caffeine.
One professor concluded that students at that university at the top of the world ranking often did not have the slightest idea of the most basic concepts about the care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course emerged after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?’
The young woman claimed that no one had ever mentioned to her the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to the improvement of overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, shoes and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine to get to bed.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it won’t change student behavior instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, as we all have the right to know the health effects of the smoking option,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “direct doing” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we sleep well enough and with quality should be a “secret weapon” for students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid getting fatter, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, making them constantly starved.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler conceive the course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to your expectations, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider using an alarm for the time to go to bed, such as to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt circadian rhythm and lead to problems.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga goal downs the men of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another out-of-home sadness when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to lose 1-0 at Livingston Stadium.
Ibrox's team wanted to record their first win on their way since the 1-0 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team ended up inflicting Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving their team eight points behind the unbeaten Hearts, leader of the first division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part, and the Rangers collective, uninspired, never seemed to be able to match.
With the Rangers now going down to sixth, Livingston goes up to third, and only behind Hibernian for the goal difference.
And there could be even more problems for Rangers after line prosecutor Calum Spence received treatment for a head injury caused by an object apparently shot from the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that surpassed Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, for his part, used the same eleven Livingston who stole a point from Hearts last week, and will have been delighted with how his well-rounded team smothered opponents in every game.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball possession, but Livingston did more with what he had.
The team could have scored as early as two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's beacon, but the average wasted his great opportunity outside.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs met Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to finish out towards the second travesty.
The Rangers managed to regain control, but the hope was greater than the belief in their game in the final third.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos thought that he should have been awarded a major quarter-hour penalty with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson turned down the Colombian's appeals.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's weak lead.
While Livingston's 34th-minute goal may have been contrary to what was expected of the game's development, it's undeniable that the team deserved it, let alone for its tenacity.
Once again, the Rangers failed to deal with a Jacobs long stop ball game.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had an immediate impact when the advanced side passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the blockage.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes behind long passes.
Holt's team may have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor held out well, defending against Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton again claimed a major penalty when he tied up Jacobs, but Thomson once again ignored the request.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Almanac "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, it is 136 years old today and continues to CONTAR ...the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A fundamental part of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When we put these headphones on, we can even hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity on the minerals.”
Evans: "Look, now you're really cracking!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that gave the name still persists.
New Vaccine for Cancer Teaches the Immune System to 'See' Harmful Cells
A new vaccine for cancer teaches the immune system to “see” harmful cells and kill them
Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to Recognize Harmful Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of a patient's immune cells and their alteration in the laboratory
These cells, which can "see" a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, designated by HER2. These cells are then re-injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “controls the growth of various types of cancer,” including those of the breast, ovary, lungs and also colorectals, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and “teaching them” to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a diatribe of support for Trump by wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance in the SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West went to the studio on Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump, saying he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat "Make America Great", he started a brawl against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times I talk to a white man and he says to me, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist!’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star broke Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been broadcast, the scene of West's bravata was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to trade for West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad bit behind the scenes because of the hat.
“They intimidated me in the back.
I was told, "Don't go there with that hat."
I was intimidated!
And then they tell me I’m marginalized,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the marginalization?", saying that "I'd put on my super-human cover, because that means no one tells me what to do.
Try the love."
His comments sparked public outcry and participants in the SNL appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, having someone from the program told the newspaper: “The whole studio was completely quiet.”
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of the song I Love It disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received a statement in support of the director of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the tweet: "To one of our bravest minds: OBSERVED FOR FEARING THE TURBA".
However, interview show host Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying that West was simply “being what it is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe is welcoming and propagating harmful ideologies for the community.
He's free.
And so do we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that it was now "or being previously known by Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg has already used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known to Prince".
Accusation of attempted murder after stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east Belfast area on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the public prosecutor.
Star of the Thrones War Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his squeaky role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, War of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the macho hero's stereotype, stating that such roles on the screen make boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed “something went wrong” and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the War of the Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted he has a "quite strong position" on the approach to the problem.
“I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men when they’re growing in terms of the problem we’re seeing now?”
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he went on: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young people feel that they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young people.”
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequels or sequels to the War of the Thrones when the series ends next summer, noting that, for him, the "battle camps and horses" ended.
Starting in November, Kit will take part in a re-edition of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the War of the Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from here on out,” she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmys-winning fantasy series.
The couple gave the knot in June 2018 on the grounds of the Leslie family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual intercourse, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70 to 90% of men who have had sex with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases derive from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
The Chinese government has promised since 2003 universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters desperately escapes information about Republican senators by her collaborator and attacks “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her team had published personal information from three U.S. Senate members on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were being promoted by opinion leaders and “ultra-right” websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes the addresses of the homes and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The leak came some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with Waters’ office and published data from a Waters staff member, The Hill reported.
“This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“My co-worker, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility in this leak of information.
This baseless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly attracted online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This liar is choleric,” Fleischer wrote.
“That suggests she doesn’t have the temperament to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they cannot become choleric.
You can't have a challenging posture.
You can't question the defendant's motives.
It must reveal calmness and serenity.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing too choleric during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will contest Waters’ place in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his cabinet had alerted “competent authorities” to these fraudulent allegations.
"We assure that the culprits will be revealed," he continued, "and will be legally held responsible for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff."
Johnny English Criticism Back to Attack - Weak Parody of Spying Film with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to seek connotations with Brexit in any new British-flavored film, and such seems to apply in fact to the new edition in the comedy and action film series Johnny English, started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satisfaction about being so bad the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes peeled and an overly elastic expression got his license to create the confusion, renewed a second time - with his name signaling, more than anything else, that it is a comprehensive comic creation intended for non-English-speaking cinephiles.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions to soft glamour, has a bit of Cloiseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean and something of that villain who contributed with a single note to the theme of the film "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, his character was originally based on the international traveler and mysterious man whose role Atkinson played in the television commercials for Barclaycard, which left chaos in his tracks.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approaches a helicopter enlarging a medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a rail noise against the helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for comedy is evident, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that “serious” film editions such as the 007 and the Impossible Mission now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We came up with the idea that humor is aimed at children and not adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English’s bizarre misadventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film numbers in Bean’s character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in a serious mess.
A hacker infiltrated the British spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to the dismay of the service agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and conflicting figure, already suffering a total lapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give much material for large flights.
Your Secret Service advisors inform you that once all the agents in the asset have been compromised, you will have to remove someone from the reform.
And this one is the distraught Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a fancy school, but giving unofficial lessons on how to be an infiltrated spy: there are some interesting numbers here, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "School of Rock".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and rejoin his suffering aide Bough, a role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a submarine commander, an evasive character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin of the Catastrophe in Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action, confronting the beautiful, fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, a role played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being dangerously bullied by the charismatic billionaire of technologies who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurdly disastrous acts: disguised as tablecloths, they set fire to a notorious French restaurant, create confusion by sneaking into the luxurious Volta yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy as it attempts to use virtual reality glasses from the inside to family.
All stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but no matter how nice and stormy it is, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is quite average.
And as in the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but ask: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does justice to his talent?
Workers deny that they are engendering a plan for the British to work four days a week, but receive five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day but five-day paid week of work.
Reports suggest that the party wants bosses to pass on savings with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers, granting them an extra day off.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping the order.
Sources say the idea "would adjust" to the party's economic program, which reorients the country in favor of workers.
The passage to a four-day work week obtained the favorable opinion of the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: “We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen from day to day, but a four-day work week is an aspiration adjusted to the party’s approach to workers’ economic rebalancing, as well as the party’s overall strategy for the industrial sector.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is not currently favored by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the party said: “The four-day work week is not part of the party’s policy and we are not considering it.”
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used the party’s conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the hands of the “faceless directors” and the “speculators” of basic service companies.
Their plans also include the non-recovery of the total share of current shareholders of water companies, since the Labour Party may make "deductions" based on perception of illicit conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, which can pocket annual dividends that can amount to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy Tell '60 Minutes' Whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh Can Make Them or Not Change Their Ideas
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview to air on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I was going to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this claim came up, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham's vote, however, seems immovable.
“I am determined as to Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be required,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett did a vigorous denial,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she mentioned couldn’t confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive star list that will act on an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host tens of thousands of people in the Central Park Grand Revolt, not only to attend performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to reinforce awareness for the true purpose of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) viewers had to perform a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or any other significant ways that contribute to raising awareness for awareness.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of “cliquetivism” – do we think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen states that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters who have exerted pressure to achieve a number of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements from its shares, with at least $10 billion of them having already been disbursed or bundled.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership bringing together investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", which promised to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end undernutrition in the country. This after receiving more than 4700 tweets from Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make social injustice of undernutrition a landmark in history,” Tracey Ullman, an ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 pressure actions on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced it would fund a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the level of nutrition.
In response to one of the site’s frequent questions, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen answers: “It was a long and tortuous path – sometimes we fell and failed.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who will perform at this year’s New York event, presented by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the navy as a "block" to put an obstacle to Russia's energy exports - Home Secretary
“If necessary,” Washington can use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, in particular, where the legitimate government’s invitation comes in, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they intend to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly of southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the ruler, there are ways and means to prevent it.
“The United States has the ability, with its navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to make blockades to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In his speech, he went on to compare Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “magician of one trick only” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump administration authorities, including the president himself, try to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “prison” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the $11 billion Nord Stream pipeline aims to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic reasons, being an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow.
The U.S. position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the US to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the German Federation of Industries (BDI)’s chief executive, following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "deeply analyze" the possibility of running for president in 2020, said Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "deeply analyze" the possibility of running for president following the midterm elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider applying.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the maximum responsible,” he said.
“After November 6th, I will look deeply into the possibility of running for president.”
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, noting that "he was taking the country in the wrong direction."
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been a harsh vocal critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll conducted on Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s own constituents are not of the opinion that she should run for president in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll from the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Center.
32% support their candidacy.
The poll revealed higher support for a candidacy from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favor of a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other prominent Democratic Party names discussed regarding a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin's post-traumatic stress at Donald Trump's rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
"What my own son is going through, what is going on after he's back, I can identify with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds our soldiers are actually going back to," Trump said at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and stated that his son and other veterans "come back a little different, come back hardened, investigate whether there is this respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all other members of the armed forces, gave to the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and possession of a gun while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokeswoman for the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are giving their support to a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district sent a statement amicus curiae (court friends) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the policy was not revealed.
The person claimed that her partner “and her children, members of a violent gang,” abused her, but U.S. authorities denied her application for asylum on July 20.
The plaintiff was arrested in Texas.
Public ministries supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision of the Immigration Resources Council that allowed immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombia’s District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignore decades of state, federal and international laws.”
“Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle,” the amicus curiae statement said.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the ban by immigration police negatively affects the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "make available the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country due to persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a certain political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 announcement.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the death toll doubles in a counter-clock to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
“The environment is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, 35, the mother of a febrile male baby, by comforting him at an evacuation center in the razed city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance brings in more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.”
Residents were spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find among their water-soaked belongings.
There were hundreds of injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured his ribs and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated abroad due to the strong replicas that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears when he reported what he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I got stuck in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife scream for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Intimidation” With “Advertising”
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid supplement on the Des Moines Register, the state’s highest-grossing newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the Nov. 6 election to Congress, an accusation denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked the beginning of what the U.S. authorities, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to pressure China.
While it’s normal for foreign governments to post ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently waging an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides apply tariff breaks on the other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed workers, farmers and American businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, “is now putting its foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertising ads in our free press.”
“With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the charismatic American tradition of freedom of expression and press by publishing a paid ad on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said.
“On the other hand, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of opinions that the Chinese may have of their country’s worrying economic trajectory, as the media are under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which one.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
At a time when many prominent Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that such a move could trigger a negative reaction, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to move forward for a vote.
These things have no setback,” he told The Hill Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute pressure to conduct an FBI investigation is enough to appease the insurgent voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget tomorrow or November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is at the door!" as they protested in the Senate atrium, given that Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's appointment despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
“Democrats’ enthusiasm and motivation will beat all records,” Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with no party affiliation, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high; it’s true.
But it may be even higher, particularly among undecided voters in suburban areas and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans advanced with the confirmation.
“This has become a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as a judge, it’s also about how Republicans handled the matter and how they handled it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans appear to be somewhat divided on who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new YouGov poll revealed that 41% of respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they considered Kavanaugh to have likely or absolutely lied in their testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s proposal, the FBI began an investigation into Ford’s allegations as well as another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford said on oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually molested her while she was drinking when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals when the two participated in a party during the period they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web aims to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has created a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that the intention underlying Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data warehouse", or POD.
This may contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
What is unique about the online personal data warehouse is that it is exclusively up to the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to provide the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of programmers on a voluntary basis.
Starting this week, technology creators around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all of their business models are turned upside down from one day to the next.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate about Internet neutrality.
While launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: homage to the decorated clergyman with the Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergyman in the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a fighter was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the decoration on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honor.
Their two grandchildren unveiled a commemorative plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable weapons and machine guns."
He then ran into the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage", led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and shooting down three soldiers from the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never match, but also a lesson of humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "felt very honored to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people."
Mixed martial arts fans wake up all night to watch Bellator 206 watch the Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this: you wake up all night to see the Bellator 206, full of veggies and, in the end, you are prevented from seeing the main event.
The San Jose series included 13 fights, with six from the main group, and was to be aired live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At six o’clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, viewers in the UK were shocked when the coverage changed to Pig Peppa.
Some were not impressed after they had been awake until early in the morning especially for combat.
A Twitter fan described the change to cartoons for children as "a kind of bad-tasting joke."
“The government’s regulation says the content isn’t appropriate for 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch to another programming,” said Dave Schwartz, an administrator with marketing and communications fur, when asked about the broadcast.
"Poor Peppa, yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said it would correct the timing of the broadcasts to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on Sunday there and we can’t solve it until our Sunday time, which is Monday in British time.
But we're working on it.
I’m not lying when I say that when the programming changed, there were many messages exchanged and none very friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, and we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn’t: it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to exceed the expectations of the fans and we exaggerated.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley claimed that he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that such gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t notice until entering high school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke out in favor of gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The program’s long-time regular host, Kirsty Young, took a several-month break due to illness.
Appearing as a pariah on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "lower" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
In his words, “to this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that gave me the power and strength to achieve success.”
His goal was to prove he was “someone,” he said, not to disappoint everyone when they discovered his sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he felt happy that he could live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The World Tri-champion reported that falling in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "took me by surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, although he said the age difference was never a problem.
“When we go through that when we’re so young” – his first Olympic participation was at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said – it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through similar highs and lows.
The couple had a son last June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "all his perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, all that mattered was to win a gold medal,” he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for the London 2012 games because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell you, ‘You’re not going to be around here to be on the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of all my life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympic Games ... there was no better feeling,” he said.
All of this was also the inspiration for his first choice of song – Heather Small’s Proud – with which he had identified himself during preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British summer time.
Mickelson down on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit a record high on Saturday when he plays his 47th game in a Ryder Cup, but will have to recover his form to prevent the mark from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record attendance, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as so many times have been in the U.S. teams, the five-time winner of the men’s major championships divided the day between the supporting role and the work on his game in the field, in the hope of rectifying what afflicts him.
Never having given the straightest shots even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the National Golf course, where the long rough usually punishes the errant shots.
And if the field alone wasn’t intimidating enough, Mickelson will face the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four games they played this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point downside to starting the 12 singles games, register a good start, Mickelson’s game can turn out to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could say much more.
“He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a respected champion who has given immense to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably wouldn't have seen him play two games.
I thought more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we'd have to go on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else.”
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for the highest number of games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never matched the successes of your individual resume.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk has stated that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
“He’s sarcastic, funny and witty, likes to play with people and he’s an excellent person to have in the team room.”
"I think the younger players have had a lot of fun getting on with him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just playing.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage may disappear at an apex
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that his loose leadership by entering the last day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily become an accidentous ride.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seven Ballesteros kept a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the narrowest margins, winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“We always tried to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but for a little bit,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 Tour win by 5-3, both on Friday, the 10th and yesterday’s Golf.
So the story showed me and everyone on this team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, give your best.
Go there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that’s where the focus should stay.
I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re well aware of who’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted with the performance of his players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance myself in that.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters is individual performance and this involves a different task.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when we’re there on our own, our golfing skills are tested to the maximum.
This is the message that it is necessary to pass on to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they’re going to leave the partner and he has to go and give the best of himself too.”
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
Furyk himself had already been on both sides of these big laps on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before finally losing when Europe pulled the "Miracle in Medinah" off the chart.
“I remember every word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players to the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum is directed to one side, the pressure is too great in these midfield games.
We organized our squad accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we're going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission of trying to lead the counter-attack, faces Rory McIlroy in the lead, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
“I chose this group of players for this order because I think it covers the entire route,” Bjorn said of his choices for the singles.
New German warship once again delayed
The most recent frigate of the German Navy was supposed to have entered service in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to breakdowns and an exponential growth cost, according to local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the newest frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the navy in 2014, but the worrying post-delivery problems undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Navy had commissioned in 2007 will serve to replace the aged Bremen class frigates.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include more extended periods between maintenance, which would allow the latest frigates to be sent on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continuing delays have made that with the state-of-the-art warships, considered as a way for Germany to project power across borders, they will already be out of date when they enter service, reports Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy refused to put it into service, having returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cite a series of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would make the warship useless if used on a combat mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly important, since the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the necessary contingent in the oldest frigates of the Bremen class.
It has also become known that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to install additional functionalities in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz has twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached an astounding <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, an increase compared to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems that plague the most recent frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German parliamentary defense committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used.
The politician said the problem grew exponentially over time, as older ships were put out of service without boats to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class had been able to join the navy.
National Trust spy on the secret life of batsmen
New investigations are being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands with the aim of revealing how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and fruit, as well as long-eared chestnuts and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations scattered by the property to follow the activities of the bats along the station.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and by volunteers with portable detectors.
The analysis by experts of all recordings will evaluate the frequency of calls from bats and what each species is doing.
A map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviors on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS’ nature conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to perform forest maintenance for bats and associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by the construction and development works that affect the dormitories and make the habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning are also a threat, along with the killing of flies and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, inspections in dormitories, and sometimes rescues.
It also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, at the Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The property's director, David Thompson, says the same is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threadave we have an excellent area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all this good habitat.
However, there’s still a lot about the bats we don’t know about, so the work we’ve developed here and in the other properties will help us learn more about what they need to flourish.”
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance on the properties, as the unintentional destruction of only one maternity dormitory can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them or destroy their dormitories.
Elisabeth Ferrell, head of the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don’t know how their populations are getting revenge.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to prosecute the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The forward of the Portuguese and Juventus squad was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is alleged that he will then have paid $375,000 for the alleged victim to remain silent about the accident, read the Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were released, 33-year-old Ronaldo described the reports as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Golden Ball winner told the House.
“They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the profession.
I’m a happy man and it’s okay,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they characterized as “an unacceptable report of suspicions in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would claim compensation for moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After being found at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player’s room, where the player has been subjected to anal rape, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga alleges that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him it was "99%" "a good guy", hurt by "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also alleged that she went to the police and had photos of her injuries taken at a hospital, but that she would later agree to enter into an extra-judicial agreement for feeling "terrified by the prospect of retaliation" and being concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now claims she intends to cancel the deal because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'would regret it forever' to lose car manufacturers
The UK would "repent forever" if it lost its status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
Clark also said that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of delays on borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My perspective is that if Britain leaves the EU in a disorderly manner at the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on the level of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are about what manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is managed on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes, from suppliers both in the UK and the EU, for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, disruptions at the border could occur, which the sector says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s “Chequers Plan” for future relations with the EU was “calibrated precisely to avoid these border checks.”
"We want to have the best deal that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the enjoyment by us of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to proceed with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Although it could not give an estimate of the downtime, Toyota said that, in the long run, the increased costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and could sooner or later lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and coordinates the United union at the site, said that its members are increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be “added another week” given there is still no understanding of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump may be preparing to fire the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fuelled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of filing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, with information that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlapping with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which they witnessed Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press adviser, Sarah Sanders, took part in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been set, it may be this week but it may also be postponed another week, given everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would not agree with such a statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said: "I would not disagree with the fact that they like the protagonism."
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president does more question and answer sessions than any previous president,” he said, adding, without adding evidence: “We analyzed these numbers.”
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We tried to do this often and they saw that we did it in the last few weeks, and the fact that they could talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
Soil press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way in front of the journalists present.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at Scottish National Health Service about fears of Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and request that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to pay for applications for resident status for EU citizens working in the country’s decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "Over the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued, with decisions expected for this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this is a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and from other backgrounds bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to continue here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
The Tennessee State Tigers' defense, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tigers' Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee team coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the interval.
“He approached the sideline and practically fainted,” Reed said.
The technical team and medical staff put Abercrombie the oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a maca and transporting him to a more in-depth assessment.
A team representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/gravity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five touchdowns on Saturday before leaving the game, raising his season total to 18 touchdowns.
A higher stamp duty will be charged to foreign buyers when acquiring property in the UK
The Conservative Party has announced plans to levy a higher stamp duty on foreign buyers who acquire property in the UK, with additional revenue to be invested in aid to homeless people.
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract the youngest voter
The increase in the stamp duty will affect buyers who are not taxed in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp duty rate will be charged to foreign buyers who purchase property in the UK, with additional revenue to be invested in aid to homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises to make more affordable housing available and tax higher incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will affect people and businesses that are not taxed in the UK, with additional revenue driving the government’s campaign to offer a roof to homeless people.
The surcharge – added to the current stamp duty, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and lease purchases – may amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp duty cut to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping property prices high when they landed land they did not use, demanding that Mrs May abandon the quotas on affordable housing to solve the "disappointment of housing" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an appealing set of housing reform proposals, including income controls and the end of "unjustified" layoffs.
It also wants to give the municipalities expanded powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I stated that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not certain that it is as easy to buy a home for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as it is for resident British workers.
For too many people, the dream of owning their own home has become too far away and the shame of those who sleep at ease remains too real.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "final ambition" is to become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the northeast club, currently third in the Premier League, to three points of leadership.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after orienting St. Mirren on his return to the Scottish First Division last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I just got a B internationalization," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound program.
“I grew up watching Scotland play Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if it succeeds in managing clubs.”
Ross' predecessors as coach of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he wasn’t afraid to happen to names so sacred in a club of such size, after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, at the moment success is like, 'Can I take the club back to the Premier League?'"
“Considering the structure and facilities of the club, its place is undoubtedly in the Premier League,” he said.
"It will not be easy to take the club back, but I will only consider myself successful here when I reach that goal."
Ross’s career as a coach is only three years old, after a period as Dumbarton’s assistant coach and 15 months in the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and led St. Mirren from the threat of dispromotion to the championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking care of the Alloa "was a real crossroads," she recalls.
“I’ve always seen myself more in the role of coach than in the role of player.
It seems strange because it went well, I gained my life as a player and had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and pressure from the position, but I feel very good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on Saturday, according to a study
The summer heatwave filled British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Restoration groups recorded a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant occupation declined 4.8%, the statistics show.
Peter Martin, CGA consultant who compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of the good weather and England's career in the Football World Cup, longer than expected, made the June standard, in which the pubs recorded a 2.8% growth in restaurants, but the sales rebounded.
The 1.8% drop in restoration sales in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the business sitting on the drinks had by far the best performance, with a homologous growth that more than compensated for the decline of the restaurants.
The pubs with the business sitting in the meals also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In directly managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6% over the course of the month, with meals declining 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and restoration analyst, said: “These results prolong the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Meteorology and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors influencing sales of the food market outside the home.
It is no surprise that restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual fall in sales of 4.8% is especially damaging when added to the prolongation of cost pressure.
The long and hot summer couldn’t come at the worst time for operators with the business sitting on meals. Only time will tell if the mildest temperatures we know in August will provide the much-desired relief.”
The growth in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator of sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, being recognized as the industry benchmark.
One in five children hide from parents secret accounts on social media
One in five children – some only 11 years old – have secret accounts on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, a study revealed.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth of “fake” pages on Instagram
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of content of a sexual nature
Twenty percent of students said they had a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children – some just 11 years old – create accounts on social media that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “false” accounts on the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of sexually explicit content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “principal” account that is innocuous to show their parents, while at the same time owning private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account found that the teenager was inciting others to “violat” her.
The study, led by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of whom admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers feel tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" or the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the regulator's annual General Assembly.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete. President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sport regulators to take advantage of their vast experience internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and world community of athletics and we are confident that Scottish athletics will have a lot to gain with its presence on the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be able to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to truly contribute to helping guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter tests at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, stopped walking after suffering a transient ischemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: “It’s been a month today that suffered a stroke.
I stopped being able to walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if he could recover and to what extent.
It’s been a painful job but I’ve achieved a total recovery, I’ve learned to walk again and I’m already doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Milk Extraction Pump Ad Compares Mothers to Cows, Sharing Opinions Online
A milk pump company shared opinions online with an ad that compares mothers who breastfeed cows in the herd.
To mark the release of what is described as the “first portable silent milk-extracting pump,” consumer technology company Elvie released an ironic ad inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom afforded by the new pump to milk-extracting mothers.
Four mothers dance in an empty haystack to the sound of a song that includes verses like, “Yes, I’m ordering myself, but I don’t have a tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, I don’t have boobs, these are my breasts.”
The chorus continues: “Bomb, bomb, feed the babies, bomb, bomb, I’m ordering my girls.”
However, the ad posted on the company’s Facebook page generated online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it alleviates the “horrors” of the dairy sector.
“It’s a sad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only that their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born.”

Another commented: "Understanding traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But yes, why not use them to announce an extraction pump for mothers who can stay with their babies?”
Someone else said, "An ad with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad, like a woman who admitted to finding the song "hylarizing".
"I think the idea is great.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a crazy bit but makes all the sense.
This product is great,” one of the women wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun ad aimed at mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or at the workplace) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video, the women’s group reveals that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, pick up their babies and even leave home while they extract milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of "Mother", commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between women who extract milk and dairy cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while presenting in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible feeling of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was a headline.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked down the aisle to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children discreetly relocated to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has peaked, although the monthly crossings of the border have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to sponsor children.
Traditionally, most “parents” are undocumented immigrants themselves, fearing to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adults who integrate their family aggregates would have to register their fingerprints, with data shared with immigration regulators.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the service detained dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of the patrons or members of their respective family members are found to be illegal in the country, many of them foreign with criminal record.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals,” Mr Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, employees have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month from the date of detention, rather than 60 days, the previous rule, according to the staff of the reception centers.
Many are present by videoconference, and not in person, to defend their application for legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those who are considered ineligible for aid will be promptly deported.
The longer children stay in detention, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent access or attempted escape, according to the staff at the reception centers and with reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say these concerns are exacerbated in larger-scale facilities such as Tornillo, where the large scale contributes to children’s disruption signs being ignored.
They add that the transfer of children to camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish “occupational forces”
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also requested the return of Syrian refugees home, despite the war in the country meeting in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such."
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that left millions more displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to “cease this sacred battle until we free all Syrian territories” both from terrorist groups and from “any and all illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
As for the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions for his return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that led the refugees to stay abroad.
“We ask the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in the last large rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement set “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would target the jihadists, including the Al-Nusra Front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, who “will be eradicated.”
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Trump will get a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the challenge and scandals end his presidency in advance.
In the one that would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever"!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue from the spectators.
Since 2014, prime-time audiences have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
“This is a strong slump for people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” about a chief of staff who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember once you called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television shows, stories from Washington will be able to determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family reunion of immigrants, and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it’s more than just being an informed citizen when we’re watching the sixth hour of a debate by experts about Bob Woodward’s use of “deeply knowledgeable” sources in his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s 15,000-dollar ostrich blouse (“a piece of Washington’s shawl-filled shawl”), hu
For my part, I will never face Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he’s done looks like a reality show because he gives us something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s dynamic cast and the daily twists of the storyline (antagonizing himself with the NFL, praising Kim Jo).
We can't miss any episodes or we're left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was closed at home, watching MSNBC while recording to CNN.
He was not breaking up with television as Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I still remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right after all."

Significant external funding in the midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It’s not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th-century circle is experiencing an influx of funding, thanks to a realignment of the electoral circles that left two headlines in the race for the same place.
The recent re-adjustment of Pittsburgh's suburban circles put Democrat Conor Lamb in the race, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb ran against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th circle.
The maps were redrafted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that ancient circles unconstitutionally favored Republicans.
The race for the 17th round sparked a fierce dispute over the funding of the campaign between the financial arms of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the highly contested March election for the 18th Electoral Circle of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This place was occupied more than a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the round by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have given a slight advantage to Democrats.
U.S. Considers Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China, Resigning
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization from office.
State Department officials have decided to call the leaders of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug trafficking control, economic aid and development.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and specific visa restrictions, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
With the continuation of the internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, putting aside any and all consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
The three U.S. representatives returned discreetly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations under the guise of anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the Administration, who also requested anonymity.
Studying the History
The next bomb to be dropped could be legal adviser Robert Mueller’s report on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, about which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will reportedly be directing his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to attack the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability from that body, while preparing to run again for voters and perhaps to be judged by his peers.
There are many hypotheses and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup d'état, as long as the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around turning points like this, in which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or hindered.
Americans are currently facing several of these inflection points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president, speculating about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says the news from The Times is incorrect.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we bathe in these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light candles of Sabbath on that table with the swastika.
With an inheritance of these, how could it not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the game with the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive tie in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month, will leave them in good position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
An injury to the knee prevented the average Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the season to tie two goals with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use this result as a springboard for higher flights.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We took the game with a positive mindset and won a point.
Maybe we could have won close to the final but, in global terms, the draw was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first half but we turned around and dominated in the second half.
Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
The last year was very hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training runs well.
I hope we can do our best, forget the past and achieve success.”
Women are losing sleep with fear of this savings-reform bill
Despite the fact that the survey participants have a clear idea of the type of care they intend to enjoy, few people have talked to their family members about the matter.
About half of the individuals surveyed in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continued care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children on the same subject.
“People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they’re not having that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t let them know your wishes in advance.
Work with your consultant and family, discussing where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your continued care financing choices may include a long-term traditional insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary valorisation to help cover these expenses, or funding using your own savings, provided you have these values available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Name a health care attorney, choosing a person from your trust to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes in case you are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the constitution of a prosecutor's office on your finances.
You will need to select someone you trust to make financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent suffers a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
“Not only financial issues are at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan.”
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was targeted several times with air pressure when he returned home after a night in the city.
The victim, in her forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries do not imply a risk of life and police have asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With the communications interrupted, the rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that extends along more than 300 km of coast, in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with administrative status lower than that of a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Fire Ring, being regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, resulting in a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, depleting a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died buried under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
Earthquakes have destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old resident in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her.
Palin is pre-trially detained at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention centre, subject to a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He was present to the judge on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously innocent," the station reported.
Palin faces charges for three Class A crimes, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year's imprisonment and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B felony, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is to be tried by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of smothering him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran associations after associating her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress arising from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died as a result of an earthquake that hit Indonesia’s Sulawesi island on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electrical and communications networks have been cut, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the Sulawesi Central region, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They circulate videos on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Ministry Calls Rare Capital Punishment for Suspect of Terrorist Attack in New York
The New York State Department is calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city – a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state by a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October on a bicycle path on West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, beating pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and inflicted "intentionally" serious injuries, according to the notification requesting the death penalty, recorded in New York's South Zone.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight counts of murder in the service of organized crime, usually used by the Public Ministry in cases of organized crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "considerable planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed him as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullahevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the statement read.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade, the Southern Zone of New York has not asked for the death penalty for an indictment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage in favor of the Soviet Union, two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court’s documentation, Saipov, a natural from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months that followed the attack.
He told investigators to feel good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked for permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s defense lawyers, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the indictment’s decision.
“We think that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for life imprisonment, without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should “feel the pressure” of Eurocetics, while one of Theresa May’s deputies suggested he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back-up MP Peter Bone said in the Birmingham rally that the UK “would have left” if Farage was a Brexit minister.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile her deeply divided co-religionists was highlighted by the conservatives who advocate permanence, who organized a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has been debating to maintain her engagement plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks by Brexit supporters, supporters of the EU and the EU.
The allies insist that she will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing the Eurocetics and the Labour Party to choose between its package and the "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he intended "to end the Plan".
Bone suggested that Farage should have been given responsibilities in negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have left," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan.”
Reinforcing his opposition to the EU, he declared: “We did not fight in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone rejected the claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and intend to remain is totally misguided.”
Brexit conservative Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the rally, telling reporters: “I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular with our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the streets and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Checkers Plan and start listening."
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: "Only prime ministers who know how to keep their promises keep their jobs."
Farage said in the rally that politicians should “feel pressure” if they are about to betray the decision to leave the 2016 referendum.
“This has become a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them they’re not going to get away with it.”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want them to pressure our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-governing UK.”
However, supporters of the stay marched to Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A crowd of activists used tracks with the message "Conservatives Against Brexit" after the group's launch this weekend.
The Labour representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with an application of the party at the opening of the congress.
“It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology ready for the ‘Canada more’, the border without friction, the free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a complete farce.
“There is no good Brexit,” he said.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" possible presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously ponder the presidential candidacy” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat talked about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican MP Geoff Diehl, co-manager of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that he could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump’s takeover.
One of the participants asked him if he was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it’s time “for women to go to Washington to fix our government’s problems and that includes a woman in the top spot.”
Arrested as part of the murder of Wayde Sims of the LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police on Saturday announced the arrest of a suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 a.m.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the images.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
"Wayde Sims took a shot in the head, after which he died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was targeted by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to his presence at the scene, wielding a gun, acknowledging that he had targeted Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a 1.98-metre-high junior created in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and held the title 10 times last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title with a win over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders at Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving the pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind in defending his position in the first two corners, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to boxing and caused Hamilton to face traffic from the end of the platoon, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxing a lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton surpassed him after a run-of-the-mill skirmish, after which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the freeway, at risk of disqualification after a double-track correction to defend himself in the third race.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, exchanging very late tyres, which would allow him to be quick in the final, aiming to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He ended up coming to the boxing in the 44th round but failed to improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to finish in fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman, letting me outrun him.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions,” Hamilton said.
The worst body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she will not have revealed a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Justice Commission, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “more, malicious and false.”
“See the beautiful thing that’s been happening in the Senate these past few days, see the anger, see how people are more, malicious and false,” Trump said.
“When we see the leaks of information and the announcements and when they say ‘oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you run away?
Do you remember her response, did you release the document? 'Oh, what, what?
Oh, no.
The escape did not depart from me.”
Well, wait there.
The escape left us... No, it wasn’t us,” she added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but denied the escape had left his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s claims, I didn’t reveal his story,” Feinstein told The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I respected your request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "You know what else, that was bad body language.
Maybe it wasn’t her, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the nominee for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that Democrats would be using the charges in his favor.
“They are determined to regain power by resorting to all means.
We see evil, malice, it doesn’t matter who can hit, who has to step up to take power and control,” the president said.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeat Belfast Giants by 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars rebounded from the defeat on Friday in the First Division game against the Belfast Giants, winning second hand for 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants gained an initial advantage of two goals with finishes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer put the Giants in front again.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald goals guaranteed the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had achieved a turnaround on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee 2-1.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching Beauvillier increase the lead four minutes later.
In a first frenetic period, Sullivan again put the home team in the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided the tie to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer assured the Giants that they would reach the first interval in the lead, scoring their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team reorganized and Bouchard tied again with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing victory by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five games, receive Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air Controller Dies to Help Hundreds of Passengers Escape Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after dying to ensure a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many remain missing after a strong earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday, sparking a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to sunbathe the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post while the control tower was violently waving at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
It remained concentrated to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, was safely taking off.
He then jumped out of the control tower, in the face of the imminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian television channel ABC News reported.
We sent a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“We were devastated by this news,” he added.
However, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, referring to the country’s disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, as there are many bodies buried by the debris that we have not yet been able to salvage," said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters have devastated Palu, where a collective funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
Lack of drinking water.
The minimarkets are being pillaged all over the place.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces at the site and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations. Are you ready?"
Earlier this year, Lombok Island in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini: Air Niugini now reports that there is a missing man after plane crash in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a missing man after it reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued safely from the plane sinking.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it had been unable to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The area company said it was collaborating with hospitals, investigators and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for disclosure of further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane broke into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
It is not yet known for certain what was the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in claiming that the plane failed to reach the runway and crashed into the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane had left the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was coming very low.
“It was the best thing that ever happened,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other people had managed to drag themselves with the water through their waist and get to the emergency exits of the plane sinking.
He told me that the on-board assistants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working on a nearby squid improvement work also helped rescue by resorting to an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network over the past two decades, 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines, but none have involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the events of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The indictment concluded its allegations on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the phone records to reconstruct the movements of the 20-year-old Quintom Tellis, and the 19-year-old Jessica Chamber, on the night of his death.
According to the Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police were talking to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and claimed he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by saying he was in his truck that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that she claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
The phone records indicated that they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett stated that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted the SMS messages, calls, and Chambers' contact information from his phone.
"You took her out of your life," Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin filing its final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to begin being reviewed by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol’s The High Breed group claims that hip hop has deviated from its roots in political orientation and social criticism.
They want to go back to those roots and return popularity to conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent renaissance in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York City's mistress sues couple for firing via a "racist" SMS message
A New York woman is prosecuting a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a false SMS message from her mother complaining that "it was more of a black one."
The couple denied the accusations of racism, saying the trial was an act of “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed some fear when she found out that her new mistress Giselle Maurice was black when she introduced herself to her first day at work in 2016.
"I CAN'T CREATE... MORE A RIGHT," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when she noticed her gaffe, a "shameful" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice claiming the poor performance of the former African-American mistress and that she was waiting for a Filipino mistress.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day of work and sent home to Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is prosecuting the couple and asking for a $350/day layoff in respect of the six-month period for which she had been chosen without a contract.
“I want to show them that they can’t stay unpunished,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple denied the allegations of racism, saying that firing Giselle was perfectly logical given that they feared they could not trust her after they offended her.
“My wife sent him something that I didn’t really want to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people,” Plasco told the Post.
"Would they trust your children to someone they had treated badly, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn son?
I don't believe it."
Calling the process “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had been a mother for only two months and had to deal with “a very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to persecute someone like that?
It's not very friendly," the investment banker added.
While the legal process takes place, the public opinion court was quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared readers might not identify with a talking bear
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented: "It's hard to get on the skin of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It’s really fun to know this now, after Paddington has had so much success.”
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before he was inspired by a small play bear to write the children's book, would not have taken it to his chest if the book had been rejected, and added that the publication's 60th anniversary had a bitter taste in its past.
About Paddington, who described him as "a very important member of our family," he said his father was very proud of the success achieved.
“He was a modest man and not a person given to gabarolice,” he said.
But as Paddington was so real to him, it was as if he had a successful son: we were proud even when it wasn’t ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on my phone
Shortly after landing, the daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
“Nad often called to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“So Nad called to say she was going to die in the next two minutes and that she had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
He said, "Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medications doctors had given him to keep the heart working were slowly stopping working and getting out of his system.
He had been dead for some time and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or complain because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to contain myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers from abroad to the rehearsal for what she was going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
“I always shake my head.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women of mourning post cards on bridge to avoid suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide fight to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, the son of Sharon Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any father to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Sharon Davis, a 45-year-old Lydney resident, said the son was a chief promising with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said he was lighting up the room.”
However, he gave up work before dying because he had "plunged into darkness".
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible impact."
Sharon Davis created the postcards "so you know that there are people who are available to help and who you can talk to, not even be a friend.
Do not close yourselves; you must speak."
Kelly Humphreys, longtime friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, his partner 15 years ago, shortly after the death of his mother-in-law.
“I didn’t say I was sad or depressed,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, there was a trap; when the kids opened the presents, they didn’t even look at them.”
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "Destroy a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake with FBI investigation
“I thought that in terms of what I was asking for — a time and scope-defined investigation — we could stay more united,” Flake said on Saturday, advancing that he feared the commission was “going to crumble” in the face of a entrenched party impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
His reluctance is only a temporary matter.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the Supreme Court frustrated.
George W. Bush has contacted senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met Bush’s wife Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not certain that Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the ballot and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors declines during Kim's regime
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean defectors to North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un’s rise to power seven years ago.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, Park Byeong-seug indicated that there were 1127 desertions last year compared to the 2706 of 2011.
Park said the strictest border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers of people ask for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public statement.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of North Korean deserters.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants and non-refugees, and it is common to repatriate them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that are in an impasse.
The talks came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Singapore’s Kim Jong-un, during which they agreed, in general, to collaborate in the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for its lack of progress.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in these circumstances it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be immediately called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all sexual abuse ties to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional openness, sometimes in a strident and dissolute voice, when speaking of his family and high school years.
He also explicitly accused the committee’s Democrats of calling the allegations made against him a “gross and conspiratorial murder” organized by liberals outraged by Hillary Clinton having lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proves he has no conditions to serve in the Supreme Court given his preconceived behavior against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
When asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's effective nomination and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you don’t meet the conditions to be in the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court.
Pelosi added that, while a Democrat, he feared Kavanaugh's potential views against the Affordable Care Act (more commonly known as Obamacare) or the Roe vs. Wade case, given the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh questioned whether certain Supreme Court decisions could be overturned.
"This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and expect us to be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women need to know how to control their emotions.
It's a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and it can't cope without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
A woman with an executive position in any company helped me immensely. She told me that she also cried when she got angry, but she had created a technique. When she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it kept going.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant," continued Mrs. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly well, in an old job in a men-dominated office where she was crying inexpressible rage, being grabbed by an older woman - a manager nothing friendly that terrorized me a little - and literally dragged down the stairs to hear her say
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re going to be satisfied that they’ve been able to affect you.”
Patricia Schroeder, on Colorado's Democratic congressman date, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship aboard a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not run for president.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she told me to laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates and another one was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who nicknamed the situation "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given his late entry, the fundraiser was less than desirable and he vowed that he would only enter the race if he could raise $2 million.
A battle condemned to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters would only give him $250, even though they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When she announced that she would not enter a formal campaign, the emotions came from above – gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and sends the message to voters, instead of delegates, and goes against sexism – and tears of laughter.
“It even seemed like she was depressed,” recalled Patricia Schroeder as she spoke of the media’s reaction.
“I would have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would you write in my epitaph?
"She's crying"?
How the U.S.-China trade war could be beneficial for Beijing
The first salvaging of the trade war between the U.S. and China was deafening, and although the end of the conflict is not in sight, from the perspective of experts, the departure of the two countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese imports that include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week was the scene of a significant worsening of the situation with new tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), actually taxing half of all goods shipped by China to the U.S.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently raising rates from 5 to 10 percent for U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has committed to following in the footsteps of the U.S. and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will wane in the coming times.
To bring Washington down would mean succumbing to the demands, but showing public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its trumps, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the U.S. can positively sustain China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“In fact, the fact that a timeless political decision by Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could have ever anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher on the Asia study at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is Ready for the Return of Refugees <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
There are now all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have left due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would receive good help for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that sponsored the revolt.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European Team beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National around Paris, France.
The U.S. has now accumulated six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time they won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is once again crowned victorious after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who proved to be in serious trouble during almost the entire tournament, threw the starting tee for the water in hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shone in all his rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5–4 to the worst-ranked player in the Europa League, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter in what may have been his last participation in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most awarded European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“It’s not my habit to cry, but today I couldn’t contain myself.
It was a difficult year.
I can't help but thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I’m happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional Garcia after Europe’s victory.
It passes the word to his compatriot Jon Rham who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods for 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"It's impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 major titles won and only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-calibre performance throughout the tournament, the rest of the U.S. national team struggled to get to the fairway.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we managed to put some fear into Europe.
We fight.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganize ourselves and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I like many of these 12 players and I am proud to be your captain.
I have to take the hat off to the other team.
They were better."
