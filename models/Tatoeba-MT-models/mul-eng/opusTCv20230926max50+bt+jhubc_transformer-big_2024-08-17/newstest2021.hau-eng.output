Why did I get out of the PDP?
Yakubu Dogara, former President of the Federal Parliament, explained some of the reasons why he withdrew from the PDP and moved to the APC.
If not forgotten by the former President of the Federal Assembly, Yakubu Dogara aligned with the PDP party, he moved to the APC this week.
He said that if he stopped drinking Bala of the PDP government in the state of Bauchi and helped the majority to win the 2019 election, he would instead withdraw from the party and return to the APC.
One of the main reasons I've been banned is how the PDP is ruling in Bauchi State.
Everyone knows what kind of role I played in the election of the former Abuja governor, Bala Mohammed appointed the incumbent governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
But now I'm in the process of getting the ball rolling.
Instead of staying in the PDP, I was given the opportunity to escape from the place where I was going.
He wrote an excerpt from the PDP which sent his party leader, Bogoro C, based in Bauchi State.
In the end, he said as he managed to show the other governments where they failed to where they would later fix it, and Bala was not impressed with the lack of it.
I'm on my way to denying them.
Gobara got up at a house in Kano.
The incident took place at about 10 p.m., which lasted nearly two hours, despite the arrest of the Kano State Police and security officials and the city's public transport.
During her visit to Freedom Radio, she informed the public of the violence and various security officials at her or me, being a location connected to the main train station known as the Kuka Station, which is being moved by tourists from here to Kano to other states and countries as well.
Not to mention the waterfront market in the north of Nigeria.
Freedom Radio has agreed with some and some witnesses to the sight and sight, who say the rise of the continent has led to a race of survival and life among the public.
A car depot at Kofar Rua station said it had teamed up with police officers to evacuate the tourists who had entered the northern industrial zone.
The Kano state killing agency confirmed the incident, saying that it was until the time we put this report together that the collection of information continues to identify the victims and victims of the incident, as revealed by the Sa'idu Muhammad Ibrahim Agency.
On the other hand, there are reports that there have been some incidents that have been attempted to move into the waterfront market for sale, unless police officers and civil servants have attempted to deal with the protection of public property.
On this we contacted the police force of Kano State DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, which confirmed the incident.
MAGANI KORONA: We have not yet finished testing the quality of the medicine included in Nigeria.
While European countries continue to test the quality of the coronavirus treatment they have included, Nigeria has also not been released in the past by combining and testing its own vaccines.
The National Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC) said it was testing the coronavirus vaccine to a maximum of 40 patients who had been diagnosed with coronavirus.
President Mojisola Adeyeye announced Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola said that the test of quality is due to the fact that it is not possible to search for a source of light.
Since the appearance of the Corona virus, emergency responders have researched to see who was not left behind without seeing the combination of the disease.
Many of them gave their medicine samples to the authorities to test and evaluate their quality.
NAFDAC has also advised them of certain conditions and regulations that will be followed to include the treatment.
The quality of the animals will be tested for the first time.
Mojisola warned the doctors not to rush to try a treatment without the agency allowing it.
In May, the NAFDAC agency revealed that social media and news sites were the only ones to be seen by whistleblowers who found a cure for the coronavirus.
Adeyeye said that as many as one person has submitted an application to the NAFDAC Agency for a review of the quality of the treatment he claims to have included a vaccine, which he said could cure the Coronavirus.
He's also a patient who doesn't have a medical condition and says he doesn't have it.
That he found the treatment of the signs of ill health that they were seen as signs of infection.
In the meantime, some of the staff members have taken over the board.

Nigeria's first day of construction of the airport will be held on Saturday.
Officials in Nigeria said they would open the airport for cruises to depart and enter the country, from next Saturday, for the first time after five months of closure.
Since March 23, the country's government has halted the entry of passenger trains, due to the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
The government said the first four flights to enter from the neighbouring countries would begin landing in the federal city of Abuja.
The city of Lagos, however, has not yet been revealed where these flights will come from.
According to the Syrian Ministry of Transport, the opening step is to see how no cross has been achieved since the opening of domestic flights on 8 July.

We've got a lot of new players in our team - Marseille.
The French-based Marseille-based football club said three more players were found to have suffered from the coronavirus, after a fifth case was found last week.
This was stated by the group in a statement issued to the media on Tuesday.

Marseille also said, the club announced the swimmers midway through the preparation of League 1, as a result of the growth of three people who suffered the disease after the first five lives were lost, to get the best out of the situation.
The APC has accused the government of delaying the election of the party - the leadership of Hausa Newspapers.
In a statement, the APC issued a statement this week accusing the Governor of Neja State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, and the party's efforts to bring the party to a standstill.
The paper, which President Muhammad Jibrin Imam of the Engineering Party and the Secretary of the Barista Party Muhammad Liman put on hold, said that, for six years and the state's ruling party, Naira had just received 512 million.
The document went on to say that the meeting of the governor called for the middle-class watermen, which he led at the end of last week's Lahadin will help to continue bringing the party's momentum, where they said they wrote to the national party's opposition about what is going on in the region.
According to Inginiya Imam, "we understand that the Governor of the State of Nigeria has tried to divide the party's electoral rolls through the organization of a water and middle-level meeting, which is not in accordance with the rules, because any action taken on the party's leaders, on writing to the party's opposition, has been postponed,
He went on to say that so far in the six years since the founding of the party, the $512 million is in the party's accounts.
He said, what he understood was that he was the governor of being on the national electoral committee that was set up on July 25, 2020, which the president led to lead to the preparation of the problems between the party members and the removal of corruption that are in court between the party members.
What money we have received we pay the salaries of the employees of their party, and other activities that concern the party, the need for a fair trial and the equalization of other problems of the party members such as health support due to lack of access to government support, regardless of the
As I have explained, the election of the previous low-level elections of the state authorities, is the most important election of the elections you have made in the country that we have done with the former commissioners and commissions that are currently holding the power challenge in all the low-level authorities in the state, which are divided into twenty-five states in the state, which are located in the state.
Thus, it is a mistake for every person whose party's finances are being killed indiscriminately, this is almost unfair and the attempt to defend the innocent is an attempt to discredit him, who is not a committee set up to investigate how you killed the party's finances and to whom it was founded.
Out of all the money that the corrupt person has been charged with, the money that the national party has given, there is no such money so I challenge everyone on this issue who has brought his or her testimony to confirm this charge by any means.
The Imam who stood firm on the defence of the APC from the attempt or who or group from the party's request, added that any indictment of the party or any party leader from the state level would be written to the committee overseeing the dispute, as the party's order appears in paragraph 21 (b).
Therefore, the party's midwives do not have a competitive edge especially if they try to escape the power of the committee so that their verdict does not have any impact.
For this reason, they are the strongest party presidents that have been accepted in the state, on the 21st and the sixth line on page 87 of the party's constitution, all that is known even this will not be used.
It is because of the decision of the President and the President that you have made a mistake.
He said, those who presented with confidence in the peaceful resolution of the litany at an unimproved meeting, such as Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, and General Muhammad Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, even Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the committees, were not members of the party's executive committee in the state.
The committee responsible for water supply and the party's interim chairman, Mohammed Imam, alone will lead it, and the government will not lead the party's leaders.
The document added that, the Governor of Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promise you made to the state community at the time of the election, and the travel of party parents in the government was such that everyone would benefit in the state and all parties by providing a political settlement, which is the problem of the party.
The document praised the members of the federal legislature who attended the meeting and drew attention to resolving all the issues among the members of the party, this is not surprising to the members of the legislature who know that you are ill, and that you accept the arrest and imprisonment as a statute.
Therefore, there is a need for the president of the National Development Committee to distract the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the proper role of not trying to disrupt state politics.
Nigeria is on the right in the economy of the Internet - Freedom Radio Nigeria
The Minister of Communications and Development of the Internet Economy Dr Isa Ali, Pantami said, the country is ready to take its right in turn in the economic part of the Internet.

How to prevent food poisoning is necessary for the health of people in Nigeria.
Some scientists have warned people not to eat food that has been used to prevent food damage that such a diet harms a person's health.
Experts have issued this warning following an investigation into the quality of food consumed in the country.
The results of the study showed that there are some foods that are being digested in order to prevent them from being digested.
The study also showed that this ingredient is most commonly used in wake, city and fish ponds that are made available to the public.
It is used as a filter because if a person sees it he will be interested in using it.
Then eat the foods that contain this ingredient of infectious diseases of the forest, diseases of the liver, heart disease and others.
The people of the country have been called upon to pay attention to the preservation of the use and disposal of these foods for their health.
If not forgotten, an expert in the quality of food Grace Olasumbo has called on Nigerians to avoid eating vegetables that have been contaminated with Calcium Carbide.
Olasumbo explained that the Calcium Carbide Syndarin is the most commonly used by marketers for the manufacture of vegetable products, namely vegetable products.
Research has shown that honesty and integrity are among the things that make marketers use this technology because in one day it releases fruit products.
Olasumbo explained that one of the things that marketers fail to recognize is the use of this technique to show the materials that make the health of people very poor.
For this reason, it is recommended to deal with diseases including colds, eye diseases, sneezing, sneezing, sneezing, coughing, coughing etc.
The president of the African national bank has been cleared of charges - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
A committee led by former Irish Prime Minister Mary Robinson has been tasked with washing up the president of AfDB Akinwumi Adesina.
Mr Akinwumi Adesina's committee said he was not guilty of the offence he was charged with.
The AFP news agency reported that, at the beginning of this year we have a fifteen-page report accusing Mr. Adesina of sixty years of guilt and showing contempt for the incompetent leadership and desire for himself.
Except for the impeachment committee led by Robinson with Gambia's chief justice Hassan Jallow and the vice president of the World Bank responsible for the awarding of Leonard McCarthy's work, they washed Nigeria's former prime minister out of all of the indictments in his own right.
The U.S. was later forced to stop and Mr. Adesina was investigated on the charge, followed by the AfDB's board of trustees, a case that led to the creation of an expert committee to conduct an investigation into the case.
COVID-19 has been the focus of Trump's election campaign in Florida.
On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he had canceled the Republican primary meeting to be held in Jacksonville, Florida, next month, as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.
However, the main event will be held in the state of North Carolina.
Trump said in Jacksonville that it was not appropriate to hold a major meeting at this time.
President Trump shifted a portion of the GOP's meeting to Florida last month after they met with Democratic Party leaders in North Carolina on the occasion of a meeting to close the meeting area with his supporters without making any promises to close the front.
Representatives of the Republican Party will meet in Charlotte, North Carolina, to officially elect Trump on August 24.
Trump said he would respond to a different approach.
Trump, who has spent months demonstrating a co- eating attitude about the impact of the pandemic, where he has recently said that 99 percent of the number of infections and infections seen have increased in the United States, will not be a problem.
Buhari is not going to accept God's promises.

It's the second-largest newspaper in the world - the newspaper's leading newspaper.
Food is the soul of all living things, it cannot be forced to live except by food.
This is the reason why China's government is increasing its efforts to ensure the prosperity of the nation's food and beverage communities.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved great success in terms of food wealth, which has given the world a surprising look at the number of people who, on average, have estimated the number of Chinese people to be 1.4 billion.
This effort has greatly helped the situation in which China has given rise to a major global hunger strike, as the chairman of the Chinese agricultural sector, Zhang Wufeng, has never revealed that, since 1949 until now, China has always been on the brink of starvation.
But in the past few days, some people and other Western media outlets around the world have been again "concerned" about the issue of whether China can control its society and itself in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world?
We would like to thank them for their continued support of the Chinese people in the world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has achieved the success of producing enough food on the basis of the man of its efforts.
The issue of providing enough food to the Chinese is one of the mainstays of the ruling JKS party on a daily basis.
At the end of last week, the chairman of the JKS, China's chief executive, Xi Jinping gave an important order to stop food poisoning, where he pointed out that, everyone knows that any food poisoning and labor difficulties are being experienced.
Although this year's impact on the global respiratory disease has also led to China's economic downturn, China may be able to provide enough food for its population.
China's agriculture authority has issued a statement on the number of agricultural products, the country's special incentives it will get in this year 2020 show that, the number of incentives received in the country in the first quarter of 2020, amounted to 27.29 million tonnes where it increased by 1.08 million tonnes, the figure increased by 3.9% in 2019.
He also Ke Bingsheng, the former head of China's Agricultural University, said, China has achieved great achievements in the face of the country's rich food supply when compared to the initial implementation of the goal of domestic conversion and opening a roof to the grain.
Huang Jikun, the direct center of China's agricultural policy study at the University of Beijing, revealed as he met with a representative of the "China Science Daily" newspaper, that the serious challenge facing China is now in the next two or three years, or China could reduce the number of casualties.
Now the number of strokes each received has reached 474 kilograms instead of 400 kilograms that every person in the world should have received each year.
And now China is on the verge of introducing millions of tons of farm products to feed only domestic animals.
Therefore, those who are concerned about the issue should be able to sleep with their eyes closed, have their eyes washed into sleep, or have their eyes on the roofs of their country house here.
They are able to control themselves and the food they produce.
The reason why I ran Ganduje in front of the court - Abba K. Yusuf - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The deputy governor of Kano in the PDP Abba Kabir Yusuf party explained the reason for the overthrow of Kano governor Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and other marketers in front of the state supreme court.
Abba Kabir explained this, by his lawyer, Bashir Tudun Tuesday, who said that, he made a decision, on the charge of owning some of the owners of government buildings and the Kano state community benefiting them.
In addition to the Kano government and marketers, Abba Kabir Yusuf has also decided on the Ministry of Works and Housing and Transportation of the state and the Attorney General of Kano and the state's county administration.
Abba Kabir Yusuf accused the Kano State government of possessing some of the equivalents of the former Daula hotel and is now under the supervision of the Wudil University of Science and Technology and the Shahuci station, which he said had violated the provisions of the country's laws.
It's only a matter of time before the adoption of the new system in 2023.
The son of Muhammadu Buhari, the supreme leader of the State, Mamman Daura, explained that the hall of acceptance held in Nigeria has become the former.
Daura's mother said Nigeria has already made a mistake and has now abandoned the electoral system in exchange for a more dignified election in 2023.
BBC Hausa has published an interview with Maman Daura, which was published in this regard.
This system of acceptance of the Nigerian presidential election did not give rise to a blind son who had been incarcerated since 1999.
Instead, Daura said that attention was paid to the position he deserved until this acceptance process was followed.
The Igbo people, the Igbo people, have changed their name to Daura martini according to their own words.
They said that he and his brother-in-law, President Buhari, had assembled the Romanian government through adoption and it would now be up to him to decide who would not do so in 2023.
But Buharin himself was not the most elected Nigerian.
Also, the major security forces of the country that have been living in the mines for many years have not been eliminated, the funds are not more likely to work.
Martanin Inyamirai.
A coup d'état against Nigeria's political leadership failed on Wednesday, while the Igbo Zalla Kabila Movement, Ndigbo, promoted Mamman Daura, because of Nigeria's presidential nomination for the Inyamurai.
In an interview with Daura, who is the father of President Muhammadu Buhari, he said that a divorce will be arranged in the presidential election to be held in 2023.
On top of that, since the words did not end the social media scandal, Ndigbo hastened to issue a notice to Mamman Daura tyr, calling for the imposition of strict bans.
In a statement issued by Ndigbo on Wednesday, a group of Igbo members of the South-Eastern Front will also be allowed to run for president in the 2023 election, the latter being Igbo.
The head of the Igbo Zalla tribe, Emeka Attamah, said the words Mamman Daura as the leader of Nigeria in 2023 were for the Igbo tribe.
In addition, why didn't he stop using the word "responsibility" in 2019?
They are about to overthrow Jonathan, and now Daura is making the southern hemisphere that will lead Nigeria in the 2023 election.
He has just completed a review of what has emerged from the hands of the current president of the country, and will then come up with a question that we know will not be accepted in 2023.
He did so as to make the old man feel that he was holding on to the truth.
He did not come out of the presidency of this country in 2023, the presidency and I showed my love for you and my love for life.
The importance of the discussion on the subject
The issue of women's and young children's abuse by feeding them has become a night's water in northern Nigeria where reports have been obtained showing how children's rights are being protected.
A number of parties attended the meeting on 23 July to discuss how the situation is worsening in the country and how it should be affected.
Her parents are concerned with issues such as child abuse and the behavior of other parents.
One of the women's parents who attended the meeting of Hajiya Fathi'a Sha'ibu, a daughter of the former governor of the state of Philato and Neja during the late Sani Abacha, described abortion as one of the things that makes parents pay attention to their children.
Hajiya Maryam, the mother of Nasir, the leader of a group that is falling apart to see war being waged against this disaster, said, "First we should talk to the parents about letting their children go out of support, because then the child is going to be raped until he gets hurt."
We will also call on the teachers to begin preaching and giving a voice to the parents and the parents who are making their children and their children happy.
He was a member of the federal parliament representing the constituency of Maiyama, Koko and Besse of the state of Kebbi Honorable Shehu Mohammad, expressed his support for the matter and support for the establishment of a constitutional law that would convict anyone who was found guilty of bribery in the country.
From the end of Hajiya, Ms. David and Ms. Nasiru El-Hikaya who led the meeting thanked those who received the meeting on behalf of the VOA who responded to their invitation.
The 'Arewa Media Writers' series is set to be released in the North.
Modern social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya and others, have always played a role in the creation of dialogues, self-awareness and communication between different worlds, with the release of messages, news, and the spread of political, media, and media.
Young people in Nigeria have become involved in this new technology by using social media platforms, to travel modern, without them running or tossing their blessings in the shadows that affect their lives.
We can say that, these bulls have brought us a lot of progress and Northern youth are benefiting them in the fields of business, economy, education and regional politics.
Some people eat food by writing and posting messages on the web, getting tasks done or developing the tasks they are running.
Unless it is a shame to see how some youths instead of using this right to eat the wealth of progress that has been gained, then others have been found to follow in the footsteps of the southern children of the country who have gone through the world through public transportation, within the country, or through writing and writing.
This is a sign of a lack of progress in the development of the country's youth.
The summer of the Northern Media Writers' Association in the country is a great blessing, to provide young Northerners with foreign, well educated and clean things that young people do in the Social Media, by how they will become writing meaningful writings and promoting the ideals of the Northern community.
It is imperative that we give this group the necessary support, in order to achieve its welfare goals, which will bring benefits not only to our northern region, but also to Nigeria as a whole.
I'm an advocate for our teenagers, especially those who use social media to bring us together to protect the North's integrity and its integrity, and to provide a system that will bring change to everyone.
As our Northern leaders who have slept well, such as Sardaan Sakkwato, the first Northern Prime Minister Sir Ahmadu Bello, and her immediate goal was to provide for the Northern community.
It has been reported that, the victims of the war and the violence and oppression of the night Aminu Kano, has never revealed that, "Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows its father's house!
So we say that, certainly as we call for the development of the country and the improvement of the interests of the government, at every step, we call for the unification of the North, without demonstrating religious or ethnic diversity, in order to bring the region forward.
When we look at the North, we don't see the North.
Therefore, we should use the Bible that God has given us by giving us guidance and counsel, in order to provide the North with a pleasant way to cope with its economy.
The North should provide the means of entry for the implementation of its monetary system without waiting for the federal government to give up its funds.
In addition to the fact that we love the development of the North, we also attach importance to education, education, open-mindedness, health and science and technology.
We don't have the money to pay for it, but there are other ways to do it.
We believe it is the North that will fulfill our aspirations!
We are proud of the North.

In recent years, some health experts have called on government officials to join hands by distributing enough money to improve the health care sector of the country.
The call was made at the meeting to promote the provision of good health for the people in Abuja.
In response to the press conference of the representative of the North Kwara under the leadership of the APC Sadiq Umar, he said that the Nigerian government should take steps to improve the health of the country.
What's not to do about this is that the industry is facing a lack of money where it puts a lot of trust and support from abroad.
Umar, despite the support received, did not have a chance to see the government play a role in the health sector where they began to withdraw the support they were providing.

He added that, then, they broke that blessing and a bully so, it became imperative that we fix our hearts so that God would bring us the best on the subject of fasting.
He knew that, even though they were for the sake of purity, they should all praise God for it is he who is causing all sorts of pain and misery to the alum.
God knows what you're going to do, He knows what you're going to do, He knows what you're going to do, He knows what you're going to do, He's going to kill you, He's going to kill you, He's going to kill you.
He pointed out that, police officers are officially doing their best because they are sending the kind of people who are accused of committing a crime to Kotukuma Alkali to do their best to try this thing that has become a nuisance, in our region of Northern Nigeria and in the country.
He called on parents in particular to keep a close eye on their children, where he published examples of the contributions that their parents have made to the problem.
He said that some of the parents of the children of the deceased either went to school or did not return home on time or did not return, adding that, on the other hand, some parents should know that God has given them children and that the next day he will ask them about the type of divorce they are having.

Adding Self-Restraint and Searching, It's What's in Your Heart - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In the Longyuan village of the Hongsipu district of Wuzhong city in Ningxia state of the self-governing Hui tribe, located in the northwestern region of China.
There is a female magician named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (whose name is Muslim) who is famous for the kind of pride she has had in life and the success she has gained over her attempts to escape from the chaos.
Her story tells us that, trying to control and seek self-control, is something that is in the heart.
At first, she was Li Yaomei or Sadiya, who had never been educated with the intention of taking a class, a situation that made her unable to read a book.
But God gave her wisdom, wisdom, and understanding, and she gave her to him who was to rule over the nations with a rod of iron.
About 20 years ago, Madam Li Yaomei, suffered from a heart attack, where she was treated for up to three times.
After her stroke and, then she suffered a serious injury, now she is walking with the force placed in her lap.
These challenges have thrown her into a precarious state of health, including the issue of drug abuse, the reason why she received a loan of about <0xC2><0xA3>3,000 over 3, a total of over <0xC2><0xA3>16 million.
What's surprising is that this combination of face-to-face with Teacher Sadiya has become a way for a woman to relax and relax in order to see her improve her life.
Then the support given by the Chinese government increased her willingness to do so.
It's the art of making different kinds of judgments about the use of food.
Due to her husband's efforts, the craft grew very large, where various crafts gave her the habit of sewing.
In addition, she has created a number of machines that help women to make the job easier.
For example, it takes about 15 minutes to add a large sentence, but now in this period, it will add up to 5 sentences.
In addition, it has produced some additional machines that clean up the cost of recycling zinc.
Then there's another machine that cleans up animal feed for women, and now even sell those machines to seekers.
Understanding the challenges that Teacher Sadiya has entered, and the effort he has yet to make to improve his life with his staff, it will be understood that the seeker must have access to it.
The work of war and poverty and the quality of life, is not something that has left the blame on the government.
If the government continues to provide support, but people have no interest in improving the peace of their lives by seeking self-employment activities based on their circumstances, then only a few will continue to do so without achieving a goal.
Her story shows that running a profession or getting paid for entry doesn't require some friends to hang out or travel to other destinations or countries outside of the country.
Because she considered the condition of her life, she used the resources that were in her hands to improve her life.
In addition, Sadiya's teacher conducted these activities on the basis of her standing and walking without trust with her husband, in order to run away from her.
In other words, trying to control and seek self-restraint is the thing in the heart.
Then he showed the kind of strength that a woman has to change her life and stand by her head without seeking the help of anyone else.
This is also a lesson that shows that, whatever a person is going to do, he should stand by his own head, because someone else is not sure.
Indeed, the Master Sadiya was a magician, a philosopher and a prostitute who became an example and a lesson for the rest of the people.
Also, by the month of March of my son, Malama Sadiya completed payment of all outstanding debts, and then stopped receiving support from the government on her own terms.

U.S. policymakers are likely to miss out on the COVID-19 pandemic - the leadership of Hausa Newspapers.
In the past few days, the chief executive of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed concern about the levels of other countries that are suffering, commemorating the pandemic of the COVID-19 pandemic that is expected to be produced, where he explained that, in the face of the pandemic, it is necessary to avoid
And the economy should be divided by the proper way around the world, so that would suit the vast majority of different countries.
Indeed, some U.S. politicians are pursuing the goal of demonstrating a focus on their own property, on the division of the disease already in existence, and are encouraging the unity between the land and the land on the side of war and oppression.
Currently, the number of people confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 worldwide has already reached 23 million.
In addition, there are people who have lost their lives as a result of the disease that has reached more than 800 thousand.
Under such a severe condition, attention is being paid to the impact of the disease pandemic, and the cause of happiness is, in later days, a major result of the study of the pandemic in some countries, a situation that has produced hope, and a belief in the international community.
But it's an internal matter, some U.S. politicians have expressed their desire for an alliance.
Even the journal "Science" has speculated that the U.S. government has already concluded agreements to buy COVID-19 vaccines with a value of more than 6 billion dollars, from companies that include many companies.
Although, the purpose of the U.S. government is understood, the existence of the United States is on the rise in the spread of the disease, but other developing countries are also in need of emergency relief, looking at the fact that they are more prone to low health resources.
The magazine "The Ecologist" also noted that, if the U.S. has achieved its goal of eliminating the supply chain, the amount of supply chain to be produced in developing countries will decrease.
Don't forget the director general of the African Center for Disease Control (CDC) Mr. John Nkengasong, he also expressed concern about this issue.
As some commentators on everyday affairs have pointed out, even if the production of the vaccine has been successfully achieved, it is not possible to achieve the vision after the disease, but it is planned how to divide the vaccine, which is a very important issue for the country and the country.
And it is appropriate for the nations of the world to strengthen the bond between them.
The Director General of the WHO Tedros, he also pointed out that, if it is to be seen after the disease, it must be woken up from all the details around the world, you may not be able to achieve some part of the world, or other countries' aspirations to recover from the effects of the disease alone.

But he also reminded the Lawmaker that he directly brought him to court, did not do another round by the hand of "the police."
He said it was the work of the Almighty to send to all those who were chosen to lay their hands on the heavens.
For he did what the Nigerian law gave him the right to take a decision in court.
The judge suspended the hearing and said he would go to court on August 4 to continue the hearing.
