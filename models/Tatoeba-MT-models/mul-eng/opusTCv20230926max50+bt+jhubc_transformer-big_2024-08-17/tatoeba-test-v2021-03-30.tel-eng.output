He's our boy.
I'm going to start this very soon.
How are you going to come?
Sin has been extinguished.
What did you talk about?
Mary bought a new dress for the party.
Lalit has been called.
I'm going to sleep when I see my brother.
He's not at home anymore.
There are two pens next to him, one with a length of another.
The ancients were slow to move.
Oh, how beautiful is Taj Mahal!
We didn't sleep for days.
Ramo is here.
He hit me.
He is Ram.
Tom was holding his hands in the air.
Oh, it's gone!
No, I'm not.
You're good?
I know you're my brother.
Mitch, is that true?
When are you going to sit down?
It's not easy, you know.
What's in the box?
Is there good water there?
This plant has some long-lasting roots.
Mitch, is that true?
It's near the station
His eyelashes were covered with hot soapy water, and he sat down on the pillow.
Do you want to be a mom before you're seven?
Is all this really happening?
The boy is a little boy.
It is clear that there is no other way.
Sita made me feel good.
"Did you work from home?
Some of the dogs are alive.
There are islands in the sea.
Did you eat it?
He teaches Spanish to his children.
How many hours do you have to go to the station?
It's an International Women's Day!
Where'd you put my book?
She has been teaching music for 30 years.
He gave her a book of books.
Mary was shocked to hear what she had done.
There is no reason to be afraid.
It's not over yet today
Abby doesn't want to say more.
We want to hear
Are you still afraid of something going to happen?
It hurt me a lot.
I had to be able to do it all.
Let's take a look at the bus stop nearby.
They didn't come
What's your room number?
When are you coming back?
He didn't get married as far as I know.
We don't understand French.
Sin has been severely punished.
Have you ever been to Paris?
Aiden doesn't have children.
We have to let go of ourselves
I don't see my bag anywhere.
They'll sing a song
You're very happy you're
We've got to get people to work.
Why can't you be prepared?
Show me where the pain is going to be.
Give this book to Ram.
He's crying for power
I know you'll tell me one thing.
These pencils are in the same color.
I'll be very careful.
I went home.
"Did you work from home?
This is a very smart question.
One, two, two, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
What color do you like, whether it's blue or white?
I'm not talking to you.
She's sitting on her lap.
We've got tennis there.
I don't believe him
I don't like coffee.
Do you want to go out for dinner tonight?
Ram is here.
What's not good for them
You talked about what.
You're good?
Oh, it's gone!
Stay where you are, wherever you are.
You're living in this area?
What are you going to do tomorrow?
We played basketball last night.
Give it to Ram.
Sita laughed.
I've never been to Japan.
They're dead
How many do you want to be?
What's the time now?
I don't know where they are.
He's put
You're good?
Thank you so much for making me squirm.
It's hard to speak English
I'm really sorry about last night.
If I were you, I wouldn't be there today.
We did it to be.
You've fallen from the ground up!
You can't get these socks off
She's not a doctor.
Why aren't you sleeping yet?
He wore clothes like a woman's.
How'd you get that bomb?
There's nothing else
The kids like to cook.
What does it mean to say the game doesn't mean anything?
You've come so fast.
The ribs are delicious.
Let's take that opportunity.
Take the tea.
What's the length of the book?
Come on, I'll give you some too.
I can't stay here longer.
You have to speak out loud.
I'll leave this time.
I don't need anything.
How many do you want to be?
How big is she?
I've got it
What are you going to take?
I used to eat it all the time.
It is not a word.
Mary would have lied to you, but she didn't.
Tom Garrett has promised to leave the family.
She was terrified of her.
It's not good for you to sit all day.
Don't let him be there
"Did you work from home?
How are you?
What's your dream?
Ah, the joy!
She was terrified of the child's death.
The movie's going to start
That's real?
Why did you call me?
Is there a guillotine?
When do you come from Vijayawada?
You can do it
People believe that it's God.
I made a mistake, but I didn't.
I'm learning the Burmese language.
You can eat in this room.
Don't hesitate to ask me for help.
It's time to get out of school.
It's not all your fault.
It's making me cry again.
My dad isn't home right now.
Ramo is here.
Is there a leak?
I'll make mistakes too.
Mary Boy's friend told her that she was going to leave.
It's a party.
Tom was very frightened.
"Did you work from home?
It's hurting my head
Where there's no music, there's no music.
Is the work complete?
Mitch, is that true?
How much time has passed?
I don't know who won.
Out of sight, out of mind.
I don't think it's useful
I'm going to the next stop.
Is it really that bad?
I'm not allowed to do that here.
What's the time now?
How's it going on the wall?
I began to talk.
Mary bought a small bag of handbags.
He's on his way to school.
He's coming to dinner tonight.
You don't have to kill me either.
Do you know why he's so angry?
It seems to be very interesting
Is it Chinese or Japanese? It's Korean
It's better to leave him alone
The help came too late.
You're telling the truth?
You don't have to go to Sgt.
Go there.
What are you saying?
Is the work I've done?
Don't stop at my work.
There are two sides to a single damage
It is education.
Is there anything else to say about that?
Mistakes
She's got cold air.
It's very valuable
Did you go to work yesterday?
What else am I going to lose?
You're angry?
You'll understand when you're my father.
He's not a good doctor, he's a good doctor.
Tell me about your day-to-day life
You can either hit him or go catch him with fish.
My computer is expensive.
Where's Mary?
He's got three times more money than me.
I've never seen him.
I'm ready to do it
You're good?
How are you?
Go there tomorrow.
I'm usually doing it.
Did you come from the school?
Why can't the giraffes sing?
Oh, how peaceful this place is!
I know he's coming.
It's not my fault.
The work is almost done.
I hear you're not good.
Why did you lie to her?
It's not so easy
You're a young
A baby came out from under the desk.
Take the tea right away.
I don't have time to talk now.
I don't speak Japanese.
Take care of your teeth every day.
When are you going to stop drinking?
The arms and legs are long, and the legs are long.
It's a lesson.
I asked him how many languages I'd like to speak.
It's been a great day for me to make my own decisions.
He put blood on his hands, and he put it on his hands.
You've got to come once.
You've seen it?
Have you ever had a heart attack?
We need money to do what we want to do.
I don't agree
Who are we?
I've heard the clock
Can I get a phone?
Shabash, the bomb is good.
Where's your boy?
Only the animal's body contains fat.
Please don't give me another cup of coffee.
My advice to you to do it.
It's a lesson.
He didn't keep his word.
Is Erra Gulabi dead?
"Did you work from home?
She opened the door when she hit her head.
Yes ?
Laila is getting married.
It can take up to an hour or more in the afternoon.
He's made every decision.
Shabash, you've done well with this bomb!
I've been drinking coffee.
How are you?
