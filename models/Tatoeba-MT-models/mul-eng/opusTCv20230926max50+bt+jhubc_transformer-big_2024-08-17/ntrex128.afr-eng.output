Members of the Wallis Assembly worry they're going to "look like soot"
There is consternation among some assembly members over the proposal that their title should be changed from AM's to MWP's (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Wallis Parliament.
Members across the political spectrum are afraid that it could trigger a spottery.
One member of the Workers' Party said his group was concerned because "this is with Twp and Pwp rhymes."
For readers outside of Wallis: In Wallies means twp stupid and pwp means deflation.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Wallis Conservative Party said his group was "acceptable" about the name change, but noted that it was a short speech jump from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of soot or foolishness.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what are called Assembly members will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Wallis Government Act 2017 gave the Wallis Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received widespread support to call the meeting a Wallis Parliament.
As for the AM's title, the Commission elected Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in a public consultation.
AM's seem to be proposing alternatives, but the fight to get consensus could be a major pain for the president, Elin Jones, who must submit a bill on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the assembly's way of working, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM's will get the last say in the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonian voters vote in referendum on changing country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to eliminate a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia, from the road.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its neighbor in the north represents a claim in its territory and has repeatedly made a cover-up against its applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells fall silent because churches in Harlem are struggling
"Historically speaking, says the old people I spoke to, there was a pub and a church on every corner," says Mr. Adams.
"Not one of them is there today."
He says that the disappearance of Crooks is understandable.
"People are socializing in other ways," he says.
"Croatia is no longer the neighborhood's family rooms where people go regularly."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who won't help the neighborhood's remaining shelters.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he says, "and therefore the day that these churches close completely will bring even closer, because most of the people who enter these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white municipalities before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved away in the 1930s.
A black community that worshipped there nearby took over the building's title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community led by Lord John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Former David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's watches."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been played out at St. Martin's for the past few months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the church's play leaders, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church council, the church's governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "is trying to transfer the costs" to the church council, although the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complain about a lack of transparency from the bishop's side.
13-year-old shark injured in California's crab dive
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured when he dived for cancer on the first day of the California cancer season, officials say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was spending half an hour on Saturday morning diving with friends when he heard the boy cry for help and then rushed closer with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought it was just the excitement of a first seizure, but then realized "that he's calling, 'I'm bitten!
I'm finished!"
His entire key bone was torn open," Hammel saw when he came out to the boy.
"I called for everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Larry Giles said at a media briefing session that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had sustained traumatic injuries to the upper part of his torso.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are fighting department store-type beauty aisles staffed by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods decline, the larger beauty trends in 11 stores across the country will be tested and if successful next year will be taken to more stores.
The investment in beauty takes place while supermarkets are looking for ways to fill shelves once used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will include trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that more and more younger shoppers are insisting on.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon in South London last week and a second which will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet purchases and a shift to smaller amounts of food purchased daily at local convenience stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said the stores are going to look more like department stores when the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products against the retail stores Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of Habitat sales points since they bought both of these chains two years ago, which, according to them, have strengthened grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument about how the profits from the pharmacies should be distributed within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's chief trade officer, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty trends to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be instrumental in providing advice.
Our range of trade names are designed to cater to every need and the attractive surroundings and convenient locations mean that we are now an on-going beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'wondering' after Holly Willoughby withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones ran away "wonderful" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled her out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their homeschooling and hospitality trade name, Truly.
The pair's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name.
This morning, the 37-year-old announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "wrong" when TV's golden girl at a tense meeting in the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she could no longer spend enough time on their home clothes, clothing, and clothing.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and reportedly would have doubled Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones climbed on a radiator and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly, Holly's greatest priority was at a distance.
It would be her long-term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to remove her completely stunned all those involved.
No one could believe Tuesday what was going on, it was so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that's right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain's most money-enhancing stars, can drive the firm millions out of the bag due to the sheer investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and the possibility that its launch may even be more delayed.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been dating Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby formed Truly in 2016 with Capp and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The pair are on holiday together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business."
Hard words "and then we fall in love"
He spat at criticism he was going to get from the news media because he made a remark that some would consider "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "newsreader" speech.
"I didn't give up anything."
He said that in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step after North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But negotiations over nuclear weapons have been stalled.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, on Saturday, more than three months after the June leadership meeting in Singapore, told leaders at the U.N. General Assembly that the North had not seen a "coordinated response" from the U.S. to North Korea's early disarmament efforts.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. is continuing with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure full.
Trump has taken a much more optimistic step in his meeting speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - it ended fire tests, helped to free hostages, and caused the remains of U.S. soldiers to be brought home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this stampede arena, we'd have almost 200 people just standing there," Trump said as he pointed to the crowd right in front of him.
Getygolf and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations have said they are not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been uprooted, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"In many cases, they were unfortunately very clear that they did not ask for international help, which makes it a bit difficult," Sumbung told me.
Although Save the Children is about to put together a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Given the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains desperately ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters are built in Aceh, it's not a common sight on other shorelines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu likely contributed to the loss of life, even though it was a warning of force.
It is at its best challenging to travel between Indonesia's numerous islands.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's plunging infrastructure a key point in his election campaign and spent money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration is driven by funding shortages as he faces next year's re-election.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of escalating sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced, such as Christian and Muslim gangs, armed with spears, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons on the streets.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks off a good equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri told Sturridge when he was about 30 years ahead of the Chelsea goal and his team was 1-0 behind.
He hit the ball to the left before he kicked far to the goal goal.
The attempt sailed high over the window as it had swung to the top right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball went over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the net.
"It was just trying to get into that position, get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible, so I just tried to create for myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and hit once and didn't think too much about it and just skipped."
Chelsea were 1-0 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goaltender played again in that play area with an agteroscope to Mateo Kovacic before scoring near the midfielder and innings in the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and delivered in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward-looking head, he then led Hazard into the window.
Hazard missed the defense and ended up with a left-foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the furthest goal.
Liverpool will face Napoli at the Champions League group stage at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, at 3pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton on Thursday at 3pm in London in the UEFA Europa League.
Death toll rises to 832 after Indonesia's tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
There have been reports that many people have been trapped under the rubble of buildings that the earthquake, which hit Friday at a magnitude of 7.5, collapsed overnight, and caused fires of up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was plagued by the destruction of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was sent from a pile to the body of a woman found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street with knife marks, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have urged people in the area who have heard or seen anything, to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything yesterday to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam footage, to contact us as they may have information that may be indispensable for us to investigate."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman at the scene showed up to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continuing as police say they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews recently tried to return to his apartment but was informed by police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take hours before they are re-entered.
It has been heard that a police officer told one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said, “It’s so ugly.”
At 2pm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another wa just outside.
A number of officers were allowed inside the cordon to monitor the block housings.
Anyone with information is asked to call <0x40>MerPolCC to DM, 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as a reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell Becomes Latest Memorial Hit With 'Rewriting of History' Twis
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious art objects performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statutes that the figures of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The image storming of the English Civil War was still ordered by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's multifaceted depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worthy of commemoration.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether it's a completely accurate depiction is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is established is that the conflict of the mid-17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
The murder of a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his "Yuan", was found dead with a blood-covered butcher near a market stall in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring piggy bank.
He said there was a large man in the cage with blood on his throat.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and disfigured," said the cousin, who was on his side of, "Wu," said, quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4.40 pm to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities negotiate after claiming compensation for his death.
Although strange, it is cases of pigs that people have already reported an attack before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig caught a Wallies farmer against his tractor until his wife scared off the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster."
"She's not playful.
They're tiny, very curious... they're not looking to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Travel from Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rains to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flooding across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph on Sunday, a Category 1 hurricane, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough over the Pacific begins to take shape and move east to the west coast of the US. As Rosa Monday approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will start to drive heavy tropical humidity northwards the southwestern US.
Rosa will bring rain on Monday from up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico.
Then tropical humidity in response to the impending drought will bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous cataclysms, waste streams and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-to-place rainfall figures of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over most parts of Arizona.
Kitts floods are possible with rapidly worsening conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It would be extremely unwise to venture into the desert on foot with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep-cloaked deserts to hit rivers and thunderstorms will bring heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trench will bring a bit of local heavy rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rainfall total figures of more than half a inch are possible, which can cause low waste streams and smooth ribs.
This will be the region's first rainfall of the wet season.
A few scattered tropical rain showers will leave Arizona on Sunday and early Monday will begin to get closer before the rains leave Monday and Tuesday to be more widespread.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the North Pole gets cooler, but the tropics remain very warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern U.S. will begin warm October, with widespread 80s from the Southern Lowlands to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher probability of above average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six television networks following the gripping testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christiane Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-fly turnaround: an agreement signed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was drinking and was trying to pull out her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a heart-wrenching testimony, said he's 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people watched Friday after that, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who look in offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a deciding football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-makers strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was ahead of all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's lengthy hearings, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was arrested Friday morning on CNN and CBS where protesters shouted at him when he tried to take a hysteria to a Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes while CNN vividly pictured how he was being beaten.
"I'm right here for you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
It was said to him, "You may have while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and walked in front of the elevator door, saying he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks covered all of the later hours of life when the Judiciary Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he will only do so with the understanding that the FBI will look into the allegations against the candidate for next week, as the Democratic minority has requested.
Flake is partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British PM May accuses critics of ‘political game’ over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has criticised her plans to leave the European Union, accused of "political play" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May met on 29 September 2018 for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview alongside her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said a proposal that Britain and the EU should be "completely fined" in advance.
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and detained on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the strike.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had confessed to shooting Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
East Baton Rouge Parish's forensic examination office released a preliminary report on Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and area residents for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanks regional law enforcement for its "overwhelming and pursuit of justice".
The Sims were 20 years old.
The six-foot-six predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball player Will Wade said the team was "beating" and "shocking" over Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about at the door," Wayde said.
Volcanic as in Mexico City
As seen from the Popocatepeti volcano, it reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity picked up in the crater and registered 183 releases of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center has a wide range of vibrations and vibrations monitor.
Images on social media showed how thin-gas engine windscreens near Mexico City such as Xochimilco covered.
Geofisici has seen an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) south-east of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists for commemoration of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined in counter-insurgency protests to commemorate Catalonia's first polarizing vote for abstention.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were held back by riot police, sprayed them with eggs and poured powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually preyed on tourists.
A shoe store also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their buttons to keep the bakery in check.
Over several hours, pro-independence groups chanted in one tone "Don't forget, no forgiveness" in confrontation with the Unionist's cry of "Long Life Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the raids, the local press reported.
The tension continues to run high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum by Madrid was considered illegal but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent but the turnout was low, with those against abstention largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the voting at the polling stations across the region from continuing in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups on Friday night camped to prevent a protest in support of the national police.
The protest continued, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he is no longer hopeful for the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital dog nail-biting victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled this year to keep momentum, with many of their best-known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention in precariously for their role in the organic supply chain.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was sparked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he will stand in European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to reject the decline in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after motorbike to house vasry
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday at around 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the fences and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at some stage to the car.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Promoted Livigston stunned Rangers to put Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal proved the difference when Gary Holt's team moved to second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remained in the Premiership undefeated this season and will face the predecessors Heart next week, ahead of which they are eight points ahead.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended their unbeaten run in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still not tasting a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston takes a chance against bot visitors
Holt's team had to move forward long before they scored a goal, with their round-up getting Rangers all sorts of problems on the neck.
SR broke through, but rotated in front of the goal corner, then AL was only able to play wide after he got closer and CH's header met over the goal corner.
The hosts were pleased to let Rangers play before them, knowing they could get the visitors with death play moments.
And that's how the ultimate goal came about.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson giving Menga a chance to kick and score a goal from the middle of the window.
By that time, Rangers had mastered but could not push through the home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos scored a comeback from Kelly.
Scott Pittman has been sacked by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow has been widely tapped to escape yet open game from Livingston.
Crossings repeatedly reached Livingston's window and repeatedly reversed, while two penalties – after Halkett's challenge from substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball – were dropped.
Livingston’s ‘Fenomenaal’ – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a great game for Livingston.
Up to the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this uplifting job.
Their playing style and team have remained almost unchanged since their return to first rank, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his multi-faceted defense ranking while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout.
The Rangers are short of inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they were able to penetrate through the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, which they find in the middle division.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile on Saturday (September 29th) when leaders from Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They have had an outcry over issues that include human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an is about to open a huge new mosque in Cologne.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police have cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from rallying in front of the mosque, but many supporters have come forward to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of their Kurds – also voiced their voices and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The fighting protests reflect the division of a visitor who is hailed by some German Turks as a hero and blackmailed by others as an outcry.
Deptford road accident: cyclist dies in collision with motor
A cyclist died in a collision in London involving a car in which he was involved.
The collision occurred around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present but the man died on the scene.
The collision comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident took place.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and to alert his relatives.
Road closures and bus services are in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Injured in Rebellion
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security man's prison, the prison office said.
The call broke out around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still underway at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado guards" have been called in to handle the riot, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated at the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to pay attention to a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our truncations and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay behind for longer periods of time."
HMP Long Martin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the chief suspect of the prison received hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, unlucky officials were called in to pay attention to serious disorder during which personnel with billiard balls were attacked.
Hurricane Pink Dreig Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsfluede (Dry Areas Trek May Benefit)
It's unusual for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona but it's exactly what could happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwestern desert and poses kitsty flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued ticker alerts for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and by Monday will be approaching with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center's models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the American Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Come, will likely get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those who are at risk of flooding, Rosa's rain is likely to be a blessing as the region is ravaged by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, only about 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme droughts, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa's path leads to approaching land across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm brings cooler water into the Pacific Ocean and therefore diminishes its power.
So it is expected that on Monday afternoon or evening against tropical storm forces in Mexico will reach the country.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be severe and contain a significant flood risk.
"A total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and to southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The biggest danger expected of Rosa is very severe rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains can cause life-threatening cataclysms and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys, a 20-year-old man, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found Saturday at around 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital where he was still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any mobile image material of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has lived among the community, the anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has lived among the community, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and angrily and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing on her claim.
The president said on Saturday the Americans saw Kavanaugh's "brilliant and quality and courage" that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most competent jurists of our time, a jurist with a clean record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican rise in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
"I'm not standing, but I'm standing," he said.
That's why I'm running for these candidates."
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor over Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesia's Tzoenami shooting, with numbers still rising
At least 384 people were killed and many washed away when huge waves broke on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday in the town of Palu on the beach for a party on the beach when firefighters broke up to six meters (18 feet) high at sunset on the beach, washed away many after they died and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, said in a statement.
"The tzoenami didn't come on its own, it dragged cars, dumps, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tzoenami moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to free the zoenami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show numerous buildings and shops destroyed, bridges that were contorted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday night, the city was still on the coast.
A series of earthquakes is felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's giant shot was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have aggravated the size of the tzoenami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "substantial" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some of the victims were found where they were trapped under the rubble of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake.
Communication "is not completely hampered by any information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not disclosing that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur imagery shared on social media, one can hear a man screaming at the people down the street on the top floor of a building desperate warnings about the upcoming tzoenami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the beach and muddy buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately explain the footage to me.
The shaking and tzoenami caused major power outages that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has only been reopened for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-soonami death toll rises to over 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu city where workers in hatchery shelters set up in their office's courtyard were on their way to scenes of destruction, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
Even as aid groups begin with the daunting task of setting up the disaster relief task, some people have complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience are prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies and personnel from overseas can only be launched after the area of the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'Well, it's a national disaster,' we can set it up for international assistance, but it doesn't yet have a status."
With the arrival of the second night on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the wonders that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was taken from a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the head coach of Indonesia's national falsification team, has directed two of the missing falsifications for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Another of those who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, was his students.
"As a senior in the falsified weaving field, I have my own emotional load," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media circulated among the fake screen-weaving community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach party.
However, his messages were only answered with one gray rectangle, instead of two blue rectangles.
"I don't think it means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thief steals $26,750 while replenishing OTM by Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The car's driver was busy emptying an OTM in an entertainment complex and getting ready to deliver more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man "came running down from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the bag money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West to change his name to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The beings formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new all Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the show that canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's producer said.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has already said in the past that the word for him has religious meaning.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"As I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of well-known rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was already known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, has also already finished with or without a link sign and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to never use military power against civilians in the wake of the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to impeach the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, where up to 300 people were killed at a time when left-wing student movements took place across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities attract the youth to gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its AI funding.
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in that field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even briefly the U.S. has an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China last year announced their plan: they are aiming to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next major AI performance in the U.S. will be achieved, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that knocked out the highest-ranked American Othello player and later was an executive officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee has given recognition to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporate ways," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years hired influential people from other universities to work at AI.
Lee said immigration policy changes could also help the U.S.'s AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI," he said.
China's Council of State issued their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence aimed at involving partners from the industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence came under fire months ago.
Macedonia's vote in elections or country's name should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", actions that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked its membership bots for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, maintains that their northern neighbor's name represents a demand in the area and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the rise will meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a price that can be paid to pursue admission to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide it.
The change of name will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state's election commission said there were no reports of unrest at 1 a.m.
But the turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia's EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko are voting for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small increase and drew chairs for tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" outcome would be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research last Monday said between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - less than the required amount.
Another survey, carried out by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the rise must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A backlash in the referendum will be the first serious backlash for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through all of Brighton's defenses for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took the Brighton defence off the road in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look pretty easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentine goalkeeper received an ace at the midfield.
He was chased between three Brighton defenders before he hit the open field.
Aguero is surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender before he even crossed several others on the edge of the Brighton goal line.
He then threw a duck to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the court to send the ball back for Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We're happy that he scored a goal at the moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League wrestling.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area on that game.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touchdowns before he led Sterling to the furthest corner.
The Sky Blues' forecaster kicked the ball in the net just before he was over the back line.
City tackles Hoffenheim in the Champions League Tuesday at 12:55 pm at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have achieved at least one promotion spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still want to capture their first division title.
"Although we're not playing for anything, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to play at the highest level from any point I'm going to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take part in it?"
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting player for Sunday, but are reportedly favorable to have Scherzer thrown into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start his 34th, had a throwing practice session on Thursday and will play on his normal Russian Sunday.
The Washington right-handed is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 draws in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump meets in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around his Supreme Court election Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican rise in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at the game in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
"It's one of the big, big – I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing and that's why I'm fighting for these candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, "One sees this disgusting, disgusting radical group of Democrats, one sees it happening now.
And they are now determined to take back power by using any possible means, one sees the community, the generosity.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to get power and control over, that's what they want, power and power, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and block."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, calling the Democrats "bad and common and greedy and false."
He referred to the name of the Senate Judiciary Committee's high-ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received harsh appeals from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?"
Did you leave that document out?
Uh, uh, wat.
No, uh no, I’m waiting for one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Church is no longer a large church.
It's unbearable for those who say what they think.
When Momentum's activists voted in my local party to put me under censorship, it wasn't exactly a surprise.
After all, I’m the last person in a string of Workers’ Party LPs who’s been told we’re not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she rose up in an unshakeable way against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me because I differed from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues that Jeremy differed from previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Workers' Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Workers' Party LP, it was exactly what Friday's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, today it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of "friendly, more favorable" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Workers' Party and every opinion is judged based on whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I thought I had previously shared similar political views, expected from me to start making a U-turn and taking positions that I would never have otherwise agreed with – whether it was about national security or the EU-only market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there’s a tirade of gossip on social media asking that I’m not re-elected, rejection of politics from the core and telling me that I shouldn’t be in the Workers’ Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I'm actually happier than my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party must cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every "motion of distrust" or change of selection rules, the party gets tougher.
I've had a lot of advice over the past two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not be so pronounced and that I'll be "okei" then.
But I didn't go into politics to do that.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago, spurred by the Thatcher government’s neglect that literally ruined my public school, I have been trying to fight for better public services for those who need it most – whether as a local council member or government.
I've never been to politics, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been at all confused about my policy positions and areas where I differed from the current leadership.
To those who proposed the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country sending out a Brexit that will harm all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Workers' Party.
But the one message I actually have isn't to Nottingham Momentum, it's to my constituents, whether they're members of the Workers' Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political advantage will keep me from doing whatever I want to do.

Two late threes may have made the final score a little shaky, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tendent's Premiership match of the day.
They are now on top of the scorer, the only unbeaten team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, that the home team wore and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our games so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Honor to Ayr, they have taken their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, scored by Frazier Climo, made Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, who was made available for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and let Ba'er count Ja.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty kick, just before he, just before resting, had a solo trio intended to make it 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's three, doomed by Baggot, reduced the rear to five points.
There was a long delay for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott which was carried off on a portable, and from the start Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, tethered by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose used the extra player with an undefeated three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a very busy game.
The home team made a comeback and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he killed Climo without the ball, and from the penalty spot MacPherson put the ball to death behind the upcoming Ayr loose.
Climo doomed it, as he had also done almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe scored David Armstrong's goal and sent flanker Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game star seems to be starting a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems Still Game star is going to move to the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was appointed as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with former comedian Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the show's last, and it seems Kiernan is preparing for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan be involved in Glasgow's "floating restaurant business."
'The sea is ours': neighboring Bolivia hopes to bring court to the Pacific
Matrose patrols a mass-produced fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are marked with the slogan: "The sea is ours to the right.
It's a duty to get it back."
Along the landlocked Bolivia is the memory of the coastline they lost in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century to Chile, still fresh – as well as the need to once again preserve the Pacific.
That hope is probably the highest it has been in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a ruling by the international court on October 1, after five years of talks.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and obviously expects the outcome with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH statement on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president – who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year – also has much to do with Monday’s ruling.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court in Bolivia will decide its favor – and that little will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to recognize Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's ruling comes just six months after the last statement shows that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than assisting Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales's aggressive rhetoric has tainted any remaining Chilean goodwill, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to conduct subsequent talks.
In 1962, the two countries exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was extremely swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will "bring an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear weapons won't come unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to live up to the promises made during a meeting in Singapore between the competing countries' leaders.
His remarks follow U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "dream picture" that continued sanctions and U.S. caps to a declaration that ended the Korean War will also bring the North on its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about distancing itself from an arsenal that the country considers the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveals Newest Series of Big Head Covers On The Road To The Shops Near You
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely turn off the sun, you don't have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have introduced a series of Lawful Oversized Head Covers at their SS19 collection on the treadmill that has cemented the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical care has gone through Instagram this summer and these designers have paraded their exciting creations on the treadmill.
The highlighter by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a feathery wide edge that pierced the models' heads.
Other oversized accessories have included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a magic hat and even a pineapple – but it’s not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had worked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature looked like snorkeling equipment, with a snorkel and diving glasses included, while another looked like a melted cream snorkel.
And if you continue the great moderation, it's your lucky day.
Style viewers predict that the huge watch may be on its way to the stores near you.
The oversized hat follows briefly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide edge seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat that has spread across social media has sent yet another big creation across the board – a striped beach bag that was almost as big as the swimsuit model it wore.
The burnt orange raffiasak, finished with raffiasings and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famed stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in stores for next summer – as the designer made such a big impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a track record of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with yet another set of excellent exam scores, which have only been reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we see that global languages continue to be a popular and desirable professions in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages above the league tables are with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 secondary schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher A in Mandarins, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French and 63 of those who studied Spanish also got an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now, as subjects, have the same reputation as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission on Occupations and Skills found in 2014 that of the reasons why employees struggle to fill positions, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more likely job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career choice someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically place above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation and was French the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in today's children's language teaching.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will provide children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach what is considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarins or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, and therefore it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut for the San Diego Lakers on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans to see how LeBron James makes his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in San Diego in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets.
But just how many minutes he's going to play has yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games in the preseason program.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage in my career to get ready," he said.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a presidential election in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five scheduled rallies next week, including stops at friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently held back for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming inter-election because the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when it is voted in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online afterwards?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7pm ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia via live stream below.
Trump is likely to pay attention to this week's hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been tense about allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote that has been held for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main focus of this overabundance gatherings is to help the Republicans who are facing difficult elections in November.
So President Trump's campaign said these five rallies next week were aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and enlarge the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who has refused to be named, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, scheduled for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, can draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind, according to the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost at the ballot box," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Rider Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows they have the courage to fight to keep the hope alive as they enter Sunday's singles game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's four-game teams were probably just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging slinger of momentum is a completely refined sports concept but one in which players believe wholeheartedly, and certainly in competitions like these.
Where would they say that the momentum is now?
"They went on with six points and now it's four, so we're wearing it as a little momentum, I reckon," Jordan Spieth said when he ran away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead and twelve more to be played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is a lot to encourage them, not least not the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was mortal from the womb to the field of purification and led by his example.
That score of celebrations got tougher as he advanced his rounds and he sank a critical sethouse to win game four completely equalised while he and Thomas were behind after two rounds with two behinds.
His settou who won the match at 15 for them was greeted with a similar shout, the kind that tells a man that he believes the U.S. team still has a chance.
"You really just have to take everything out and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all the players are listening to now.
18 stitches to print off their stamp.
The only players who have more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undoubted story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's odd but adorable couple got four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't record a track count on Saturday afternoon, but they also missed one on track count on Saturday morning as well as during the back nine Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy apparently flows to and from these exuberant crowds, confirms that they are the players to be knocked out on Sunday, and there will be no wilder player like Fleetwood or Molinari who can win a potential European victory when the sun strikes over Le Golf National.
Prefer both at the same time or at different putts.
However, it is too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made shorts with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he played alongside Alex Noren.
One likes about the track number and two doubles on the front nine, the Spaniard and the Swede landed in a hole from which they could hardly even come.
No one is there to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball and four-game teams are so exciting to keep close watch because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in a blink of an eye.
Europe has so far always played better as a team and has significantly taken the lead on the last day, but this four-game session has also shown that the U.S. team has the courage to fight which some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe run 10-6 ahead during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming with a 10-6 lead from Saturday's four-ball and four-game matches.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to maintain the trophies they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, has an American team that has performed unevenly in the morning's four-ball dominance, so they won the series 3-1.
The U.S. has more resistance area in the four games and has won two matches, but they do not let the back-up shrink.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 singles games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to score four points after their first four games.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they played excellently together to defeat a dad Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliance but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and four-game and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who calmed down during the morning's four balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are first and third on the world rankings.
However, on a pleasant day with a little wind southwest of Paris, Europe didn't always get their sense.
Jordan Spieth, who won a major tournament three times and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They scored a difficult 2&1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four games after losing the first two wickets.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point back when they entered the singles game, though Furyk's team only had to play head-to-head to keep the trophies because they already hold them.
However, after being second best for two days, it doesn't seem like they'll get a teen attack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will "decidedly not" unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions exacerbated their distrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had "significant voluntary measures" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site and promising not to nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons.
"We don't see a consistent response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will certainly not unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons that would reward North Korea if it took gradual steps, his words seemed meaningful because it did not obliterate unilateral elimination of nuclear weapons in the unpredictability.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim undertook to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons" in North Korea's defense of Trump.
North Korea wants a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted requests to ease strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. urges the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exercises more pressure from the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even to object to the "declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions aggravate our distrust."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader drew attention earlier this week at the United Nations.
The minister has instead focused on three meetings over the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, adding: "If the party on this issue on the destruction of nuclear weapons was South Korea and not the U.S., the destruction of Korea would not have affected the destruction of nuclear weapons."
The tone of Ri's speech was, however, dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's fire arrows would be directed at the U.S. landmass after "Mr. Bose President" Trump gave Kim a "firefighter" on a suicide note.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to "totally destroy North Korea," praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions still need to remain there until North Korea is destroyed.
Trump said on Wednesday that he didn't have a timeline for this, saying "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "application of sanctions by the Security Council must persist and continue unabated until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unilaterally stepped up sanctions against North Korea in an effort to de-escalate funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the eve of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea accused him just hours later of making "genuine demands."
In a meeting with Moon, North Korea has pledged to break down a missile plot and also a core complex if the United States takes "coordinated measures."
He said Kim told him that the "consistent measures" he wants to see are security assurances Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on enough Russian.
A new course at Harvard University this year allows all of its undergraduate students to get more sleep in an effort to study the growing macho culture by working against caffeine-driven "whole-night sessions."
An academic has found that students at the world's top university are often indifferent when it comes to the basic principles of how to see for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after he delivered a talk about the impact of sleep recruitment on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one has yet told her how important sleep is - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first offered that year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how they improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were taken seriously during the week.
The hour-long course involves a few interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dorm room, where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep intake can increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know this won't change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know what the health effect it is to choose to smoke cigarettes," Prof Czeisler added.
The culture of pride in 'studying all night' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep adoption is a growing problem.
To make sure you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's "secret weapon" should be to avoid stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, which feeds you all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he ran one of his classes at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to coach him for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof. Czeisler has recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when they are going to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythms and cause you to be disturbed.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal to defeat Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another setback when Dolly Menga's goaltender Steven Gerrard's undefeated team suffered a 1-0 loss.
The Ibrox team wanted to score their first visitors since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only gave Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as a driver so his team was eight points behind Hearts, which ran loose in the Premiership.
Menga allowed seven minutes to rest, and it didn't seem like a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
While Rangers now fall to sixth position, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there can be further difficulties for Rangers after border guard Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown off the road.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the final match of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been in his noppies with the way his well-trained team had beaten their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated the ball possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They actually had to score after just two minutes when Menga's first pitch Scott Pittman sent through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder opened his big chance.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only miss a kick at the back goal.
Rangers took control, but it seemed there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he should have scored a penalty at the quarter-finals when he and Steven Lawless bid, but divorce judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get just two shots to the target during the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was intercepted by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a macho goalkeeper from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opener at the 34th minute may have been against the direction of play, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it's just for their hard work.
Rangers didn't even handle a deep set of Jacobs once again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed cool and sent it to Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard appeared at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but chased the impressive Kelly from his strip to the block.
But Livingston has continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett having long-time ball palming in after long ball.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to turn Jacobs before Lithgow could get far from the corner point.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty kick when he got through with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and OUR TEL VERDER... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geigerteller.
Since then, the Geigerteller has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What on earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these headphones, you can even hear the effect of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Guys, this is about to crash!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancerous tissue can teach the immune system to "see" cells
New cancerous tissue can teach the immune system to "see" and kill Rower cells
<0xE2><0x80><0xA2> The immune system learns to identify predatory cells as part of treatment
Method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory.
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman who has been treated with the vaccine, who learns the immune system to identify predatory cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that occurs in many cancers and is called HER2 and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of various types of cancers," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and "teaching them" how to attack cancer cells has worked to knock down some sort of leukemia.
Kanye West, after his performance on SNL, began a pro-Trump streak while wearing a MAGA hat.
This didn't go well.
Kanye West was cast in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an elaborate performance in which he believed U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town and during which he wore a Make America Great cap, he ran against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk so often to a white man and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star spotted Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it's not broadcast, the footage of West's quarrel was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It's unclear if Rock for West is trying to spot it by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that it was made difficult for him behind the raise about what he was wearing on his head.
"They've got me behind the wheel.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on."
They've bugged me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would wear his "superman coat, because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comment attracted at least twice an audience audience cheering and members of the SNL cast seemed humiliated, Variety reported, with one person there saying to the publication: "The whole studio has become a dead-end."
West was brought in as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the space cleat Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with a performance of the song I Love It, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West is backed by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESISTANCE TO THE SKAR."
But gossip showwoman Karen Hunter tweeted that West simply "was who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') who I believe accepts and proclaim an ideology that puts my community at risk.
He's free.
"Me too," she added.
Before the show, the spacecler announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he is now "the creature that used to be known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Co-creator Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, popular music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who used to be known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder over knife-piercing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast with a knife.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in front of the Belfast Court of Appeals on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticises toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the macho hero's stereotypes and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believed "something went wrong" and asked how to address the problem of toxic manhood in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, acknowledged that he felt "quite strong" about working on this issue.
"I personally feel pretty strong about it at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What did our men learn as they grew up about the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television is most likely responsible for the growth in toxic maleness due to its extremely male characters.
He continued: "What was born and what was learned?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
"Something was obviously wrong with our young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not participate in any of the Game of Thrones sequels and sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, as he says he is "ready with battlefields and horses."
Starting November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a rower.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on this program, so that's how it gave it to my future family, and my life from here," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the hustle and bustle of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, which represents a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission by sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to make the case work.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked GOP senators' data, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday issued a statement against claims that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat has claimed that the allegations are fueled by "ultra-right" experts and websites.
"Lies, lies, and even hideous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate panel's hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place at some point after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the placements is related to Waters' office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of this fraudulent and false claim - was not, of course, responsible for the extent of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly sparked online criticism, including former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
Don't be challenging.
Don't question the defendant's motives.
He needs to be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being seemingly too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tried to light Waters from the cushions in the interim election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he said.
In her statement, Waters said her office had "notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the pilgrims are put to the test," she continued, "and that they will be legally liable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous for every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again review - flou Rowan Atkinson spyspottery
It is now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new film with a British accent and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy spottery franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and continued to struggle in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will language-in-the-choice self-satisfaction on the subject of how eye-opening power we are the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the helpless Johnny English with his cheekbones and rubber face has his license to tear everything up for the second time renewed - and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking movie audiences.
He is, of course, the disgraced secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretension to sophisticated elegance, has a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr Bean and a good shot of those who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire team at the 2012 opening ceremony.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of puzzles, which leaves chaos behind him, who Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest version of YOU.
I loved Johnny English, who came running to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armor suit and briefly grabbed the screwdriver's blades against his helmet.
Atkinson's gifts for physical comedy are displayed but the humor feels rather vague and peculiarly superfluous, especially when the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now use self-confident comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's tesseau isn't as original and focused as Atkinson's stylistic jokes in the persona of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cybercriminal has infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, until the agent's dismay at service - a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a prime minister who is an inflated and beleaguered character, already experiencing an overall collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomson is doing her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there is little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is in danger, she must call someone from his retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English himself, now in service as a teacher at the one or another responsible institution, but who gives lessons from the record on how to be a secret agent, there are some nice jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type espionage school.
English is recalled to Whitehall for an emergency assignment and reunited with his former long-suffering companion Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an allamapstic role in which too little of Vicki Pepperdine is expected.
So the Batman and Robin of it all are in Her Majesty's Secret Service to completely rekindle their service and come down on Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister comes under the dangerous affirmation of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the enigmatic Jason Volta, portrayed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of hideous escapades: disguised as waiters they set a French restaurant on fire, causing them chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's hatchery hunt; and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a headset for virtual reality to trust Volta.
For that last scene nothing is saved, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is quite like children's TV.
It's pretty mediocre.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help thinking: Can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really brings his talent to justice?
Labour denies that it devises a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause Britons to work a four-day week - but pay for five days.
The party wants to claim that company-based savings caused by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution must be transferred to workers by giving away their extra day.
This will allow workers to enjoy a three-day week - but they will still receive the same payment at home.
Sources say that it will "fit" at the party's economic agenda and plans to set the country in the interests of the workers.
To change after a four-day week was signed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambition that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Workers' Party will not be the first to sign such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day working week during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, the ambition is not currently being endorsed by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Workers' Party said: "A four-day week is not party policy and is not considered by the party."
Skadu Minister John McDonnell used last week's Workers' Conference to reject his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of "selfless directors" and "winners" at service companies.
The Shadow Minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to recover their entire investment as a Workers' Government can make "removals" on the grounds of alleged infringement.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on corporate boards and create inclusive equity funds to give 10 percent of equity in private sector enterprises to employees, who can get annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy Tells "60 Minutes" Whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh Can Make Them Change Their Opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings can convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republican Sense asked John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dive into anything they could change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing, I said, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that accusation came out, and said, "Did you do this?
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, however, appears to be unchanged.
"I have formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an indictment of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett vehemently denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who called her couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the World Citizen's Day and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Burger Festival, an annual music event featuring a particularly impressive group of stars performing and having an equally impressive goal; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizens' Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the occasion's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Day, which began in 2012, is an expansion of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a BBP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as doing volunteer work, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or making a phone call.
But just how successful was a 12-year-old world citizen who remained to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism" - people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, World Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says these actions have helped spur global leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that could potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", and promising to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after they ended up spending more than four hundred dollars.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to bring the UK closer to improving nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the general questions on his website asking "what makes you think our extreme poverty can end?"
World Citizen replied: "This will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will be successful because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists performing at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use fleet for "blocking" to reverse Russian energy exports - Minister of Home Affairs
"If necessary" Washington may leave him on his fleet to reverse Russian energy landing in the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just like in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he said.
And, according to an official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not land on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees of an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that considers itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration was on a mission to give the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe a boost to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Berlin Moscow's "prisoners."
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S.'s view prompted a counter-reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider it" to stand as president in 2020, Massachusetts senator said
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider it" to stand as president after the midterm elections.
During a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing up for it.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and set up our divisive government and that includes a woman on top of the sport," she said.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider it to stand for president."
Warren aired her opinion on President Donald Trump during the village meeting and said he "takes the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very vocal in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation for our vote."
A poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should stand in 2020.
Eighty-five percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Two-and-thirty percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed to be possible in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin named Track Palin's PTSV by Donald Trump bye-election
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested on Monday evening and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son has been going through, what he has been going through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the injury our soldiers are returning with," she told an audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the departure" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence and possessing a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Poliesta.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court legal order in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August has not been made public.
She said her partner "and her violent gang members" had abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state attorneys supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigrant Appeals) that allowed immigrants without the necessary documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such attorneys violate that policy," the friend-of-the-court legal order said.
Prosecutors further stated in the legal order that the policy that denies immigrants access harms the U.S. economy and says it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary work."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country of birth because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership to a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in its policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious problems – that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly rife.
"It feels very tense," 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said as she comforted her naughty baby son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute brings an ambulance.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been seen returning to their ruined homes, searching for flooded properties, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude shooting, were overwhelming.
Of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who recovered a fractured back and shoulder, rest outside Palu's weather hospital where patients are treated outside due to persistent strong aftershocks.
Trane fills his eyes as he recounts the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
"I'm impressed with the walls, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Affluence' With 'Propaganda Ad'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper that praised the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China Beijing accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid installment in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's highest-selling newspaper - after accusing China of interfering in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, a complaint that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. election has marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters, a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington is to put pressure on China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war that has led to their complicating tariff quotas on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were aimed at beating exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now exacerbates the outcry by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government embraces America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing, one will find very limited dissenting voices and not see any true reflection of the diverse views that the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic trajectory given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he said.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has scrapped the offer to publish his article," although he did not say which newspaper.
Republican female candidates for interim elections with Kavanaugh debacle, warning analysts
While many top Republicans at the Supreme Court stand and defend Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions about this are running extremely high, and most Republicans are on record that they already indicate that they want to continue with the vote.
Those things can't be reversed," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill, said in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he was doubtful whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s push for an FBI investigation would be enough to pave the way for angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters drove "November is on the way!" as they protested in the Senate's entrance portal while the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it was already high; it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among Swastim-female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don't vote often because they don't like the president."
Even in front of Ford's public testimony detailing the details of her allegation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
"It has become a nightmare for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote and whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem somewhat divided on who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more choosing the latter's side.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents either believe Ford's testimony or likely believe it, while 35 say they do believe in Kavanaugh or are likely to believe it.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitively shocked during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's move, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other cop, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford last week, under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee, testified that Kavanaugh assaulted her at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee revealed his genitals to her while attending a party during their student days at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web is planning to start a new internet to challenge Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, is launching a start-up business that seeks to engage with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee remarked that the idea of Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, business lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional utilities.
This is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls this "personal authorization by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
As of this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications by using the utilities available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about introducing an overall change or not, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he leads Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria's Cross-Spiritual Fairy
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was venerated 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sharpshooter and never knew he had earned the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliant symbols" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt. Col. Vann on 29 September 1918 led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "by very densely missing and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later rushed him to the line of fire and with the "greatest bravery" led the line forward before he man-only stormed a field gun and knocked out three of the department.
Lt.kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never stand, but something that is disappointing."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Corps.
Michael Vann said he "felt saved to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by a bunch of people."
MMA supporters stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay up all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, just to not be able to watch the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be broadcast live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to say the battle, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the fight until the early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the transition to the children's signage scene as "some kind of sick joke."
"It's a government regulation that the content was not appropriate at 6pm and therefore they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about the recast, I think we can probably work something out," Coker said.
"But it's acid in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But our work on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were a lot of text messages that were sent back and forth and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We’ll limit it to five fights instead of six – as we normally do – and we’ve tried more for our fans and just gone over our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley has a "minor" feeling about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't go to high school before he realized that "not everyone is like me."
When he spoke at the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was lulled by his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that in order to become a parent, he was less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The regular host of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, has been down for a few months due to illness.
When he appeared as a cast member on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less" than anyone else when he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
"To this day, those feelings are less felt than, and otherwise felt, the true things that gave me the strength and energy to achieve success," he said.
He wanted to prove he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he has comforted his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and want to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “captured him on the sidelines.”
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference was never an issue.
"When you passed through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says his "whole perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last good things he asked was whether they already had tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've been dreaming about for the rest of my life - to dive in front of my home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – which also resonated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gives him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson doesn't drive and retires on Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to adjust his form to turn it into an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for a record 12th time in the two-year event, was pulled out by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball games and four numbers.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he was already often for the United States, the five-time Major-winner will divide his day between being a race leader and working on the practice floor of his game in hopes of fixing what scales.
Even at the height of his career he was never the rightful driver and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National track where the long ruveld always penalizes the lingering hold.
And as if the job on its own isn't challenging enough, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth game on Sunday, teaming up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 singles matches well, Mickelson's match can be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed his confidence in her husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a slap on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Heroes Room and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I don't think he's going to play two games.
I put more in perspective, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there on the job, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the player who played most of the Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This may be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never really matched the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence contributed irreplaceable aspects to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to be crazy, and he's a wonderful old man to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed having fun with him, which was fun to see.
It's more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the last day's singles game in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
De Deen made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team under the leadership of Seven Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but only won by a tie with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"One keeps reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won the tie," Bjorn said, in the photo, after watching how the Class of 2018 went on Friday 5th and National.
So, the story will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're going to be fine tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I still say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are in our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side - the best players in the world."
Cheering about how his players have risked on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I'll never go forward with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes in turn, and it's a horse of a different color.
It's great to be out there with a mate when things go well, but when you're individually there, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to pass on to players, put the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also put the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will want his players to sail better individually than they did as gamemates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of those great last-day converts, where he was part of the wish team at Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every covert word of it," he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, spoke to his players bravely on the way to that last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as seen at Brookline, as seen at Medinah.
When that momentum starts in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle games.
We then set up our team and classified the men we felt, you know, will bring us something magical tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the teen attack and comes in the main game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top half of the league.
"I chose this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers it until the end," Bjorn said of his singles picks.
Germany's new warship has been re-launched
The German army's newest frigate would have been put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it won't be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, local media reported.
The use of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoted by a military spokesman.
This vessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the distressing post-delivery issues have plagued this ambitious project's fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a string of air defense and anti-ship missiles as well as various secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home gardens.
But continuing delays mean that the advanced warships – which will obviously enable Germany to project force overseas – will already be obsolete by the time they are in service, called Die Zeit.
The crash-prone F125 frigate took stock last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the Navy has sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Min is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if it is deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the men’s war on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also emerged that the ship was heavily overweight, which reduced the work performance and reduced the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons "Rheinland-Palatinate" is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used in World War II by the Germans.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project – including the training of the crew – also became an issue.
It has obviously reached an incredible <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems that plagued the new frigates become especially important in light of recent warnings that the strength of Germany's fleet is being curtailed.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy's "ships that can be deployed are being attacked."
The amps commander said the issue worsened over time, as old ships were out of service, but no replacement vessels were provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to Vlermuise's secret life
New research is being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano dwarf bat as well as the brown long-tailed and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations on the property to track flyer activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also make mobile recordings using hand-held indicators.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will check the frequency of the bat groups and determine which species do.
A Habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat for the bats are the most important and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as weed farming and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Flea populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping space and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and weather can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by house cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eggo-orientation technique to show off goggas and obstacles on their fast-tracks.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly do recordings and sleeping place inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organisation even established Scotland's first and only dedicated poultry reserve at Threadave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten poultry species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threatave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We've got the old buildings, a lot of veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there's so much about bats that is still unknown, that's why the work we do here and on other properties helps us better understand what they need to flourish."
He stressed the need to search for bats for maintenance in properties being done because it is possible that unknowing destruction from a single site can mean up to 400 whales and small children's deaths and an entire local population can be wiped out.
Mosquitoes are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or prevent them from destroying their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations sail."
Ronaldo pulls out rape allegations as prosecutors prepare to file a lawsuit against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed rape allegations against him as "fake news" and said people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue German news magazine, Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375 000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he addressed his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, ended the reports as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the whole thing.
I'm a happy man and everything is right," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's attorney is preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the claim, which, according to Reuters, they called "an unacceptable reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy."
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount consistent with the seriousness of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her after believing anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" who was left in check by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a court order because she was "feared of reprisal" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the move because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and this summer moved, in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal, to the Italian giant, Juve.
Brexit: UK will "forever regret" if its automakers lose
The U.K. "will regret it forever" if they lose their status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "concerned" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will have to temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see how production in our factory is halted," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK engine manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have raised fears of leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-trading will work.
BMW, for example, said they would close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automakers say supply chain risks are in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars placed on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be disruption on the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
"It will be impossible for Toyota to maintain more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant," the company said, and therefore production will be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only to enjoy the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications from not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what was an extremely successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but cautioned that added costs over the long term could reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and the Unite Union's co-founder at the facility, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it never comes back.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "be postponed for another week" as the bakership over nominees for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian election merger, links between Trump's assistants and Russia and possible violation of the law by the president.
Whether or not Trump is going to resign the deputy attorney general, and thereby threaten Mueller's independence, Washington's ski resorts have been on fire for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to thanking.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not to thank" Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate bench's hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump postponed a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote further.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for that has not yet been determined, it may be this week, I can see it being postponed with another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll always love to keep the press up."
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not due to a counter-intuitiveness for TV journalists who are "effect beacon," although she said: "I won't argue with the fact that they are effect beacon."
She said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without recalling evidence: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then it's infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot and you've seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press statements with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and at times, bizarre appearance to journalists who were there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and express the wish that they will remain after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed them to cover the costs of negotiated status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up their preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very exciting time for all of you.
That's why I want to repeat how much I contribute to the price of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service's work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would very much like you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers lynching player Christion Abercrombie has had an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State's chief executive, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came up to the sideline and kind of just got there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was out of the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are "no details yet on the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving away from Illinois.
He died five times on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season to 18 dead.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans.
This move will neutralise Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters.
The stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be imposed on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that the government plans to help counteract homelessness.
The additional tax – which is outside the current seal tax, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on second homes and homes purchased for rent – can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are purchased by non-UK citizens who raise prices and make it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “spook villages” due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people own their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping property prices high by picking up land, but not using it and encouraged Ms. May to distance quotas on affordable homes to restore Britain's "housing disaster."
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of proposed housing improvements, including rent management and an end to "non-wrong outages".
He also wants to give more power to build new homes.
Ms May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life.
But it can't be right that it's just as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies to buy homes as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness is too great a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "biggest ambition" is to become Scotland's driver at some point.
The Scott, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new lives in the North-East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Lig Stadium this summer after he returned to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I got the second team, but it was already," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But as a child, I often watched with my father for Scotland at Hampden and it's something that pulls me back.
"But I can only do that if I'm successful at the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not afraid to follow such established names at such a large club, after he had previously shown off offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, success for me will be measured by ‘can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself successful if I can get the club out there again."
Ross's career in management is only three years away, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and converted St Mirren from on the verge of relegation to champions of the Championship in the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroad," he says when he recalls how he took over Alloa's estate.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds bizarre, because I've done well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and experienced reasonable highs.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things a person needs to do every week.
I'm still going through this in terms of the stress and pressure of the job, but management just feels right.

The summer heat wave improved Britain's struggling crop income, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drink places and pub groups saw sales in July rise by 2.7% – but receptions in restaurants were down by 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of business consulting firm CGA, which compiled the figures, says: "Predicted sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a similar pattern than the previous month, June, when drinking spots were worth 2.8 percent, compared to the restaurant's value of 2.8 percent.
The drop of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drink-guided drinking spots and pubs have fared better and risen more than what restaurants have fallen.
Kos-led drinking places also stayed in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators.
It's like people just want to go out for a drink.
Regularly run pubs and pubs increased sales by 6.6 per cent for the month, with food was down by three per cent."
Paul Newman, of relaxation and hospitality analyst RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Again and the impact of major social or sporting events remains the biggest factor when it comes to sales in the out-of-home-out-market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly difficult above and beyond sustained expense pressures.
The long hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-led operators and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring the necessary relief."
Total growth in sales across beverage venues and restaurants, including new venues that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand announcements.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – have hidden secret social media accounts from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta pages"
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "headcount" to show to parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in “false Insta accounts” – a reference to the Instagram photo division.
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "header account" to show to parents, but also had private accounts.
A mother who came to her 13-year-old daughter's secret job has found a teenager who encourages others to "rape" her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of those admitting to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't track them down."
Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" on Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her far-reaching international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect for Scotland, the UK and the global athletics community and we are sure to be athletic in Scotland will greatly benefit from what she brings to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to act as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American, who had the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games among his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC connoisseur, unable to walk after having had a short-term ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it fully recovered, relearned how to walk and do fitness exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast pump advertising that compares mothers with cows shares opinions online
A breast pump company has shared opinions online with an ad that compares breast feeding mothers to cows being milked.
To celebrate the launch of what is called the "world's first quietly portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie has released a tongue-in-the-kick music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom the pump gives to moms who are milking out.
Four real mothers dance in a shed full of straws and cows tailored to a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a star" and "If you haven't seen, it's not owls, it's my breasts."
The chorus section said, "Pump it out, pump it out, I run the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the ad posted on the firm's Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it underscored the "threats" of the dairy industry.
"Very weak decision to use cows to advertise this product.
As we have to get pregnant and give birth to be able to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.
The Elvie brush pump is only discretely in a feeding arm (Elvie/Mother)
Another person remarked: "Understanding traumatic experiences for mom and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: "The ad is so out of touch."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was for her "creepy nudity."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I was still breastfeeding.
To make milk out made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit of a template, but I've accepted it for what it is.
"It's a great product," one wrote.
Another person remarked: "This is a fun ad aimed at moms who are milking out (especially in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cool."
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who are milking out say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is dead-end, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly in a feeding bracket that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are milking.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a large and exciting launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who are milking and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges into the limelight, while in an entertaining way people can find connection, demonstrating the wonderful feeling of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has picked up the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to clear rhetoric and policies set up by the Trump administration that make it harder to place children on bail.
Traditionally, most burqas were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be jeopardized by moving forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential burqas and other adult members of their households should go to their fingerprints if and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs enforcement official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had applied to secure unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are either citizens or housewives of citizens are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal aliens.
That's why we're going to continue to prosecute those individuals," Mr Albence said.
In an effort to process the children faster, officials have set new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conferencing call, rather than in person, to advocate their case for legal status at an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unfit for emergency lending will be deported quickly.
The longer the children stay in detention, the more likely they are to get anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say those concerns are raised at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child's disability is more easily overlooked due to its size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish 'occupational forces' to withdraw immediately
When he addressed the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and would be "handled in accordance with the law."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more uprooted, is "nearly over."
He said Damascus would continue "to carry out this sacred struggle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions are in order for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returnees," he said.
"They're politicizing something that just needs to be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel settlement of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement rejected a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has "clear biases" and expressed the hope that military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who will be "redeemed."
UN Gen. Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members soon to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to "taking care of the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberals are likely to hope, a state of indictment and scandals end his presidency early.
In what is undoubtedly "the most dramatic finale of a presidency will ever be!"
To this day, there are no signs of eye strain.
Since 2014, peak-time viewership figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and barely tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is on top of cable viewers with as much as 3.5 million viewers on major newscasts.
"This is a fire to which people have been drawn, because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congressional Building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he lets me laugh,'" he told me. Scovell told me.
There's a lot of fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
Switching out is a luxury that can only afford the most favoured viewers.
And yet it goes on to be just an informed citizen when in the sixth hour of it is to watch a panel of experts debate over Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 full-leverage-flying jacket, and Washington's clothing sewn around the skirt.
I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is he's feeding you something every night," says Brent Montgomery, chief operating officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's changing cast and daily kinks in the plot.
A person can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you'll be left behind.
When I reached Mr. Meats this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was almost looking at MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not get away with it, nor was Brett Kavanaugh on his way to appear before the Senate Court and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the scales.
"I remember when we were doing programs all that time and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Flesh told me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but now it looks like they were right."

Out-of-pocket power after most exciting mid-term election race in Home
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th saw a surge of money, thanks to a move by congressional districts that has now landed two amps carriers in a race to get the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburgh district allows Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – to measure forces.
Lamb faces another amps carrier, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily overcrowded with the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally demarcated in the Republicans' favor.
The race in the new 17th ended with a campaign funding competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Campaign's Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a widely viewed special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political leaders have given the Democrats an advantage in the first place.
The U.S. has considered punishing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then relapsed.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, earlier this month.
But fines have only been considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, which include a reduction in financial assistance and visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent that from happening.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted Congress to continue to effectively end any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now set to address the Congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the meeting for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. senators returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new angry messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Studying the history
The next thing that could happen may be the special discussion about Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible over-judgment of the court, of which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also likely to focus his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia has cooperated in the country's attack on our elections.
Should Congress pass into other hands, Mr. Trump will have to face accountability in that body, just as he prepares to go back to the voters, and perhaps eventually to a jury of his port group.
This is a bunch of asses, and with that, I do not want to let you know that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – and not those of his peers in Europe either.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be drawn out.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, when the West had only just resisted him and supported the Czech-Slovakia at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the ruthless course of democracy is being hastened or delayed.
Americans are now facing a number of such turning points in the face.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported that he proposed last year to covertly include the president and speculated on whether he was eligible for his amp.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times' report is incorrect.
"How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh's newly requested FBI investigation is not complete or justified - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm election for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we look at those tests, there's a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I don't think we will fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once lived in my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to go sabbaticals on that table carrying the swastika.
With this coming back, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimism for Rapid Vienna fight
Rangers play hosts for Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive tie-break in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month they will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this draw as a starting point for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game with the conviction that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the end, but a parallel count is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is a big European day.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a feel-good factor on the spot.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
"Hopefully we can push through now, last season behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over these retirement money fears.
Despite the fact that recording participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't express your wishes long ahead of time.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Introduce your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term care funding decisions can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own assets – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut off legal disputes at the appropriate time.
Get a health care proxy in place so that you can appoint a trusted individual to monitor your medical care and ensure that experts meet your needs if you can't communicate.
You should also consider the perfect fit for your finances.
You have to choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your accounts are paid if you are ineligible.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play out those details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues involved, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What's the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with windpush
A man was shot several times with a windshield when he walked home after a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as an "eventful act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsoenami's in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications out of action, emergency management officials could not get any information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5-magnitude shooting.
More than 16,000 people have been brought to safety in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located on the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit them.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi Province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A Tsoenami also hit western Dongala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major tremor along the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 that led to a tsunami hitting 14 countries has resulted in 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong tremors hit the western coast of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds have died on Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude shooting struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, which led to a ten-meter-long tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and resulted in about 300 deaths.
2016: A flat shot hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shot and tzoenami in 2004.
It didn't lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 died from buildings that collapsed.
2018: Major shootings hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The shooting destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charge
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, meddling with a report of domestic violence, and facing arrest, according to a report released by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took a woman's phone call from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pre-Trial Facility and is being held on a $500 uninsured bail, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, decisive" when asked what he was advocating, the network reported.
Palin faces three class A violations, meaning he can be locked up for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, punishable with a day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
The girl said that he had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's behavior to PTSD as a result of his duty in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake-zoenami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been put out of action with death rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that shows the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspect in NYC terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that caused eight people’s deaths – a rare punishment that has not yet been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck engine to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan to grind off pedestrians and a cyclist who was on his way in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "targeted" the eight victims and "targeted" serious bodily injuries, according to the announcement of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges carry possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, including eight counts of murder for extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for "decent planning and preconceivedness," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out it as "disgusting, cruel and perverse".
"Sayfullo Habibullahevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York has justly pursued a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of a conspiracy to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were erected with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after he watched ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "naturally disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than accepting a debt recognition to life imprisonment with no possible release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in control of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a promise to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to get rid of the “hot feeling” of Euroskeptics – as one of Theresa May’s own LPs suggested he should be in control of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backer Peter Bone told reporters in Birmingham that by the time the UK "would be out" if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Ms. May to unify her deeply divided officers was prompted by pro-Roman Tories joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan running amid attacks from Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted that she would push through in her attempt to enter into an agreement with Brussels in spite of the deadlock – and force Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between her package and ‘chaos’.
Mr Bone told the Loop-Meeting Loop-by-Meeting in Solihull that he "wanted to sniff out Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made a nobleman and given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in control, we would have been out by then," he said.
The Wellingborough LP added: "I'll stand up for Brexit, but we have to ban Chequers."
He expressed his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone has shown hand-in-hand that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the March and told reporters: “I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are actually bombing the streets and making sure we are elected in the first place.
Please let the Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Ms. May, she added: “First ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farge said the assembly politicians had to "feel the heat" when they were on the threshold of ignoring the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is about a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with it.’
In a message to the enthusiastic crowds, he added: “I want you to have our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, to feel the heat.
“We are mobilizing the people’s forces of this country who have given us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud UK.”
Intuitive, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists have waved Tories against Brexit banners after the group's launch this week.
Labourman Lord Adonis spotted the conservatives for the security issues they had endured with a party application such as the conference opened.
"It's the people who tell us they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a total smart.
"There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to ‘look hard after’ to stand for president
Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she would "watch hard to stand for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, stood for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the midst of speculation that her Trump may be going to challenge in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump was in power.
A resident asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time "for women to go to Washington to correct our broken government, and that includes in a woman very high."
Arrested in shooting death of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University's campus.
"Wayde Sims sustained a gunshot wound to the head and was finally killed as a result," Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on stage, possessing a weapon, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
A 6-foot-6 youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 rebounds last season and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton clinched world title after team orders him to win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
From goal position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel got into the pits first and Hamilton failed to get into the traffic very behind the wheel, something that had to have been decisive.
The Mercedes took a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went on to wheel-to-wheel action that left the Ferrari driver relatively risk-free to see the inside at risk of endurance after a double-movement to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the rear of the road and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the races as he held on to his ties to get ready quickly and past Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually got into the pits in the 44th round, but could not accelerate his pass in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It has been said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri did fantastically and was a true gentleman.
The team has done extraordinary work to have a one-two," Hamilton said.
It's been a bad lye.
President Donald Trump at a meeting on Saturday mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein over her insistence that she did not like Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia and did not directly address the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he made a comment that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "common and unobserved and lying."
"The one thing that can happen and the nice thing that has happened over the past few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and common and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you like it?
Remember her answer... you liked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't like it."
Well, wait a minute.
We liked it... No, we didn't like it," he added, in a preface to the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter expressing the allegations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak from her office had come down.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I didn't like her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it as confidential as she asked."
But the president did not like her denial well and made comments during Saturday night's meeting: "I'm telling you what. It was a reasonable bad sacrifice.
Maybe she hasn't, but it's the worst lyftal I've ever seen."
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominees who are accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to be able to take it back with any necessary means.
You see the community, the injustice, they don't care who hurts them, who they have to surround in order to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer has scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars defeated the Belfast Giants in a 5-3 draw in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead by castings from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee head-to-head before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals tied their win.
It was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe's men who first lost matches and then won Friday night Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford holding the assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break in when he threw his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again got their heads-up with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran agreed to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead in the second half for the first time in the game and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who have now lost four of their last five games are home to Milton Keynes in their next game Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on plane could escape earthquake <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people had safely boarded.
More than 800 people have died and more are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area and many have been caught in demolitions in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung has refused to leave his post in the control tower that has been very busy at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained motionless to ensure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to ascend safely.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he had the day it tumbled into each other.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach the thousands with the country's disaster relief agency saying access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll continues to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble while many cannot yet be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Golwe, who has reached up to six meters, smelled that Palu would hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The minarets are taken orally."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross hunts to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military service: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
"Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is missing after beach sea plane crash
The airline, which handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia, has now said one man was missing after they said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed near the runway in the shoreline.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had overshot the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane entered very low.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through mid-deep water until the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the air hostess panicked and screamed and that he had suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy said shippingmen who worked close to improving a key also helped with an inflatable boat with the rescue to land people back and forth before sinking the plane into about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in collapses of PNG-registered air carriers in the past two decades, but Air Niugini had been involved in one.
An analyst sets aside time of night when a woman is burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cellphone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from various phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was pulling in Sanford that night, Sanford said he was "shocked because my pulling was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Self-records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls and contact information were erased from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final run on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origin of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the basics and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Is there a black person?!
New York City's Children's Complaints Couple Suspended After 'Racist' Text
A New York children's juggler pleads for discriminatory renunciation after receiving a misdirected message from the mother who complained that she was "another black person."
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the case to "repression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, eased her anxiety when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEE N<0xC3><0x93>G A BLACK PERSON," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to me twice, however.
After she found out her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman thanked Maurice and said that their outgoing children's wife, who was African-American, did a bad job and that she expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice paid for one day's work and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages over the waiver and seeks his damages up to the amount of $350 per day for the six months, residential works for which he was initially hired, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such good," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple backtracked on the claims that they were racist and said it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice's occupation and feared they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," the man told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were inexhaustible, even if it had been through abuse?"
"Your newborn baby?"
Come on."
Plasco compared the case to "pressing" and said his wife would have a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're just going to go back to one person?
"It's not a very good thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the case was still going on, the court of public opinion had been quick to bring the couple on social media and catch them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter revealed that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not connect readers.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's great to hear about Paddington's success."
She said her father would have been furious if his work had been rejected. He had been a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death was "bittersweet" last year.
About Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an apple-tree man," she said.
"But because Paddington was an ego for him, it was almost as if one had a child who achieved something: you're proud of them, even if it's not your job.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Even if it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was about to die and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was ridiculously bad, that they didn't expect her to do it," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I received Nad's call to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I had to greet her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medicine the doctors gave her to keep her heart at bay was slowly beginning to get up and leave her system.
She's been dead for a while, and her body is closing.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was as unfolding.
I couldn't think or scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to put it together."
Finally, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, who at the time was hurt by the loss of her daughter, along with the other passengers on board the plane - unknowingly appreciated the trial she had gone.
"No one knew," she said.
"I hit my head and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got an overwhelmingly sympathetic feeling for Nad on the flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women post cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey's postcards have been on a Walliese bridge for some time now with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he started leading to depression and killed himself at 18.
"I want no parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising boss with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
"They always said that his smile made some sort of departure clear."
However, he gave up work before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he took his own life.
Me Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the maps, "to let people know that there are people out there who you can go to and who you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still - you have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't make eye contact or anything with them."
She said her death had been very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It broke a hole in the family.
This is tearing us apart.
We all have to go and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still uncertain as FBI probe begins
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for - a timeless investigation that didn't take any bribes - maybe we could bring a little unity," Mr Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "going to fall apart" under alleged partisanship.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters have to set up an FBI investigation?
It's all because of the timing.
The by-elections are only weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans sail badly, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who met through him his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI released its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor that will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Number of ‘Down’ Under Kim
The number of North Korean fighters has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the South's unification cabinet and said there were 1,127 landslides last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates demanded by human traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of warriors from the North are finally being offered South Korean civil rights.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly-protected demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
China considers the warriors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war with each other - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks that centered around the ongoing negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons.
It came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday slammed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterias", says he is not authorized to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "histeries" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman ever acted alone, they would say 'histeries'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh had been very emotional and at the time he was barely screaming and screaming as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly rejected Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a "legitimate and coordinated character assassination," organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed that he was pre-judged against Democrats.
"I think he makes himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi joined forces when she was asked if she would try to appeal Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the House of Commons.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not authorized to be in the Supreme Court, but to be in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade as he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh questioned whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'It's not wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
It's a fair diatribe, months and years of anger that overwhelms, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said that she cried when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would have cried for the person she was talking to," I said.
I'm angry."
And then she just walked in.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tranes are permissible as a partial exit for lice because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with nameless anger and being grabbed by an older woman - a cold driver for whom I was a little afraid - who grabbed me in a trapdoor.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they had an effect on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an out-of-court relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the reef, Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well of the decision," she told me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
It's called "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with fundraisers and so she made a promise that she would not enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, she would only give $250.
"Do you think I'll get fired?" she asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not lead a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - grateful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates - and angered her.
You would have thought that I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled to me about how the press reacted to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate guarantee.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
"Did she cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening up of the trade war between the US and China had been overwhelming and while the battle was over, a disagreement between the countries may be beneficial in the long run for Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning earlier this year by charging important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week has come with new tariffs affecting $200 trillion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 trillion) of items and effectively half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing has taken in goods reprisals every time and recently slashed tariffs from five to ten percent on $60 trillion in U.S. goods.
China has promised to equalize the U.S. shot-by-shot and the world's largest economy will not move in the near future.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to publicly comply with US requests will be too much of a concession to Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure on U.S. trade war over long-term China can positively support by lowering the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that an economic twelve-hour flight can begin in any one of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously known," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asian America.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by war for more than seven years.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have marked their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have already fled the country since the war began in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the flat-lined country.
But he stressed that it will not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that have secured the invasion.
Europe beats Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, dropped his T-hole in the water at the par-3 16th hole and conceded his game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has stayed in all his rounds and has become one of the 1 of 4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, has 2 and 1 case to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's European winner of all time with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
Thank you so much to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," an emotional Garcia said after the European victory.
He handed over the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday won U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game.
"The incredible pride I feel in winning Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked to old age," Rahm said.
Woods has already lost four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all week to find the clean-up field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: "I'm proud of these guys. They fought.
There was a time this morning when we had a little bit of heat in Europe.
We've scrapped it.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup. I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to serve as their captain.
You have to keep your hat on.
We're overwhelmed."
