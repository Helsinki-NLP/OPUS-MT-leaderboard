Members of the National Assembly of Wales concerned that they will be ‘compared to Muppets’
Members of the National Assembly of Wales are outraged by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name will be ridiculed.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP “rimes to Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside of Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poo.
A member of the Plaid Party's National Assembly of Wales said the group as a whole was "unsatisfied" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was “open” to the name change, but noted that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short u.
The National Assembly of Wales Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to implement the name change, said: “It is of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who make the final decision on their new title.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the members of the National Assembly of Wales the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
At the moment, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have a hard time reaching a consensus and she will have to submit a draft law on the changes in a few weeks' time.
The legislation on reforms also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote definitively on their new title when they debate the legislation.
People of Macedonia vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, voters vote whether they want to change the name of their country to ‘Republic of North Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve an imminent dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens long claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia’s requests to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the name change, has said he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, argue that the name change is simply the price that must be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's are silent, those of Harlem have a hard time
“The older people I spoke to said that there used to be a café and a church on every corner,” Mr Adams said.
Today there is no cafe or church to be visited.”
He said it was understandable that the cafes were gone.
“People now have social contact in a different way,” he said.
“Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly walk around.”
However, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of the assets of the churches will take less time than the leaders expect, and sooner or later they will stand back at the beginning.
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that won’t help in the remaining refuges in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will cause these churches to be closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were once built by a white church congregation, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church community of white Methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church community in the vicinity took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shoppers in 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Honor Johnson made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a beard.
Honorable David Johnson, the son of Honorable Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin’s, proudly called the beaver “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the beaver in July referred in a different way to the instrument: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first beard in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger beard of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's had not replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the church's lay leaders, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders) wrote the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese would ‘consider the costs’ to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and patrons of the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old Who Died of Cancer in California
Saturday, on the first day of the cancer season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who succumbed to cancer in California. The boy sustained injuries, it sounds.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had docked with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy scream for help. Together with a few others, he peddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was calling because he had caught a cancer, but then he realized ‘that the boy was calling, ‘I’m being bitten!
I've been bitten!"
His key leg was completely open," Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
“I screamed that everyone had to go out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he allegedly is in danger of life.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Beach guard Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that a few weeks earlier a shark had been spotted nearby, but that it had then been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break into the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s will enter the competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and will set up beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in department stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sales of fashion and household items continue to decline. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores throughout the country. If they are successful, they will be able to win more
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the shelves where TVs, microwaves and interior items once stood with other products.
Sainsburys wants to double its beauty offering and offer 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also gets more space, with exhibition space per brand, such as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique make-up back to the market, as most products are suitable for vegans, something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery the Fragrance Shop will test out concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the former being opened in Croydon, south London, the second being opened later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and buy small amounts of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury’s, says the stores will look more and more like department stores, as the supermarket chain takes it up against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury’s has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sales of food has increased and the acquisitions have delivered more returns.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its Beauty and Pharmacy departments a make-over, that became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested out a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended when a conflict arose over the distribution of proceeds from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury’s 281 pharmacy departments in the stores three years ago sold for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have completely changed the layout of our beauty department, making it more enjoyable for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way."
Peter Jones 'worried' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is "wonderful" because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
Jones and Willoughby’s company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is furious at Holly Willoughby because she has recently retired from their lucrative lifestyle company to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “worrying” when Willoughby announced on Tuesday during a difficult meeting at the company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that she was not leaving enough time for Truly, their brand of homewear and accessories due to her new contracts (worth over <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million).
The company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s fortune by an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would be leaving Truly, Jones left for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: “Trily was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would secure her long-term future, and deliver enough for the next decades.
Everyone was amazed when she decided to retire.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was planned for soon.
The warehouse of the head office in Marlow is full of products that are ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now be further delayed.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became President of the company in March.
The two couples often go on vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program on the British ITV channel.
A source from Jones’s entourage said last night: “We have no comment on his business matters.”
Hard language “and then there was love between us”
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media for a remark he made that some people would find “inappropriate for a president” and for his positive outlook on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have been stalled.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea sees no “similar response” from the United States after North Korea’s first disarmament initiatives.
Meanwhile, the United States is continuing with its sanctions to keep pressure on the kettle, he said.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
“We are doing very well in North Korea,” he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results. The missile tests have ended, hostages have been released and the physical excesses of U.S. military personnel have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach in relation to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get access to this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok no longer had a home, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for starting up international aid.
“In many cases, it is unfortunately clear that they are not asking for international assistance, which is difficult for us,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, but it’s not sure if the foreign aid workers can work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said Indonesian officials were still assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to hide from tsunamis, but along other shores you rarely see them.
The fact that no tsunami warning sirens were present in Palu, even if it was a warning of force, has probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Even in ideal conditions, it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship in Lombok intended to treat victims of earthquakes is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia’s homeless infrastructure was one of the core points of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko’s government has to contend with a lack of funding, while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a previously conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs were fighting in the streets, with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes an impressive equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge ruled Liverpool last Saturday for a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was 1-0 behind.
He tapped left against the ball and then shot in the direction of the furthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, in the direction of the upper right corner of the net.
He woke up the jump from Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante approaching and dared to try. I didn’t really think about it, I just shot the ball.’
Chelsea were at rest with 1-0, after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues tip kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed through the midfield to the Liverpool half.
Kovacic made a quick one-tweet in the middle field.
Then he gave a nice pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the net, next to the back pole.
Liverpool will play in the Champions League group stage against Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 15:00.
Chelsea take up the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster relief agency said Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake from last Friday, which also triggered waves of 6 m high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The town of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of ruined buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after wife was killed
This morning, a woman’s body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street. The body showed stab wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking local residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation has only just begun, but I want everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious requests to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, in particular taxi drivers, to contact if they may have filmed something via a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential for our research."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends came who thought they knew the woman on the spot to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police have confirmed that they are currently notifying the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A policeman reportedly told someone that the area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She kept repeating, “What a mess!”
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the detachment and a third were just outside.
Within the detachment, a number of agents kept an eye on the apartment building.
Anyone with information will be asked to send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, with a log 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue at the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history' rally
The banishment of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s suggestion as “dumb” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on removing statues would lead to the fishing of Oliver Cromwell’s figure just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, created by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many still believe must be recognized today.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: 'Cromwell is, of course, the monarchy by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, considered a defender of parliament against external pressure.
Whether that is a completely correct presentation is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and remembered.”
Pork Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, known only by the surname ‘Yuan’, was found dead at a market stall in Liupanshui in Guizhou province. His butcher was pierced and he was under the blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to feed pigs at a pig barn, on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring pig barn.
According to the cousin, there was a large male pig with blood on its mouth in the pig's throat.
A forensic investigation revealed that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” said the cousin with the surname ‘Wu’, according to the Guiyang Evening News newspaper.
Images of surveillance cameras show Yuan arriving on the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not of Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others, while police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare, but there have already been cases of pigs attacking people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kg pig pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba testified to CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood aggression can be elicited.
“They’re just playful.
They're just kids, very curious... they're not about to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's tail brings heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as she has reached the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest in the coming days.
At a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. local time and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical moisture is pushed northward, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimetres of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that reacts with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, landslides and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will cause rainfall of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain 5 to 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There are sudden floods possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as the tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly recommended to walk into the desert when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can turn ravines into desert rivers, and thunderstorms will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching trough brings local heavy rain to parts of Southern California’s coastline.
Rain of 1.5 cm is possible, which could lead to small debris flows and smooth roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in the rainy season.
Widespread tropical rains will bring Arizona closer Sunday evening to Monday morning, after which the rain will spread more Monday late in the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the U.S. can fluctuate strongly, as the North Pole gets cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the continuous summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the middle and east of the U.S., October is expected to begin warm, with temperatures fluctuating around 30<0xC2><0xB0>C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York it can be 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that by mid-October, the chance of over-average temperatures in the eastern United States is great.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on one of the six television networks following the gripping testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, a U.S. Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an alleged assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, as broadcasters interrupted regular programming for Friday’s surprise: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh bet on her and tried to pull her clothes out during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a sealed testimony that he was 100 percent sure this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people who have been reported by Nielsen are likely to have watched on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
No figures were immediately available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking in an office.
In comparison: that’s about like for a play-off of a football game or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, which supports Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s events.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his vote, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning that protesters shouted at him as he tried to take the elevator to a hearing of the Justice Commission.
He stayed with his eyes down for a few minutes while being chimed, live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling people the truth?
Someone shouted, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various channels sent everything out live when the court committee had to vote hours later on Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in advance with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee by next week, something that the Democrats of the minority insist on.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who had criticised her plans to leave the European Union of “a political game” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit. He said that her proposal that Britain and the EU should impose charges against each other was ‘absurd’.
Wayde Sims shooting party: police arrest Dyteon Simpson as suspect in LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot dead.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in prison on suspicion of death, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and found Simpson’s DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police questioned Simpson and later stated that he had known that he had shot Wayde to death.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The East Baton Rouge County corporal has published a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The report states that the Louisiana State Police’s Fugitive Task Force, the state police’s crime lab, Southern University police and local residents all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
Sports Director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his “introduction and pursuit of justice.”
The Sims were 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was ‘captured’ and ‘in shock’ by Waydes dead.
“This is an event you always hope it will never happen,” Wade says.
Volcano erupts as in Mexico City
The ash that is spewed out by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater had picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center detected several times debris and vibrations.
Photos of a thin shaft on motorways in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, have appeared on social media.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a magnitude 7.1 hit central Mexico on the Richter scale.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists successfully hit the riot police, while thousands took part in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia that divided the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists, who were stopped by riot police, shook the agents with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, shellings broke out with the police, and the officers pulled their knuckles over to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Don’t forget, don’t forgive’, while their opponents shouted ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for light injuries they sustained during the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region, one year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters spoke out overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who voted boycotted the vote against secession.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in the polling stations in the region, resulting in violent shelling.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the spot Friday night on Saturday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia’s prospects of becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even if it was that nip, this year it was difficult for them to build on their success. Many of their best-known leaders are absent, either in self-imposed contempt of the exile or in contempt of a prisoner of war.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old motorist who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
“The tensions are rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in provisional custody since the end of last year, declared that he will take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
“A candidacy for the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was rammed with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 7.30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that at some point a crossbow was fired on the car.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the win
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and provided Steven Gerrard with his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to equal terms with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed this season to win an away game during the Premiership, and they have to record Sunday against leader Hearts, who is eight points ahead of them.
But first the Rangers Rapid Vienna will receive Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston remains unbeaten, the team has already won six consecutive games in his division, and coach Holt has not suffered a single defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against strong visitors
Holt’s team had long been able to make a head start for the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused all sorts of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal, and then Alan Lithgow, who raised Craig Halkett's header, kicked the ball above the goal.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances to be calm and confident.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free kick and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the penalty area.
At that time, the Rangers had already owned the ball for a long time, but the defense of the home team was impassable and goaltender Liam Kelly had not yet had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure Kelly had to avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball at the feet of Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after an ambush by his Livingston colleagues.
Livingston's penalty area continued to be reached, but they were forced every time. Twice a penalty was refused, one after Halkett's attack on striker Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Livingston's 'Fenomenaal' - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played without exception excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team have barely changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves a lot of recognition for the way he has whipped the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Leader Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on top of their toes throughout the game.
However, the Rangers were unable to break through.
Even though they have played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they only managed to close the home team once) and the Rangers will now realize that they need to play better because they are somewhere in the middle of the class.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a bright blue sky and with a wide smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went together for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th).
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne for the opening of a giant new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police called for security reasons when they raided the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathisers came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the split over a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in a plane crash on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that officers were engaged in identifying the man and his immediate family will inform them.
The road is closed in several places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Cypriots Injured in Order Violation
Six cypresses were injured in an order breach in a heavily secured men's prison, according to the prison agency.
The riots broke out at around 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ chippers are used to solve a situation in which eight prisoners are involved in one department.
The cypresses were treated for slight injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the prison said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible are in any case referred to the police and may need to stay behind for longer.
More than 500 prisoners remain in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison in the hospital had been treated after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called to jail for a serious order violation in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (with possible positive effects for drought areas)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa moves across the southwest of the desert area, bringing risks of flooding with it.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden flooding to the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and to the south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday. It will be raining on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the 200-mile area of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimetres in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there 10 cm is possible.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the Rosa rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, part of this rainfall will likely be favorable, as the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are indicated, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the one in a second-highest category.
The route of Hurricane Rosa reaches the mainland via the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still on hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, weakening them.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive Monday afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
Heavy rains can occur in parts of Mexico, which carries a significant flood risk.
“A total of 8 to 15 cm of rainfall is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,” weather.com reported.
Rosa moves north across Mexico like a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then take place Tuesday night through Arizona and in southern Utah.
“The biggest danger that is expected of Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and southwest of the desert,” the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and landslides in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured at around 4 a.m. local time in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is ‘stable’.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed anything of what happened to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered under the Democratic Party's community, anger"
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh, during his nomination process, was constantly “suffering among the community, the anger” of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh testified Thursday before Congress and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
During the hearing, Ford also testified about her allegation.
The president said on Saturday that the “American people” saw Kavanaugh’s magnificent and incredible character, quality, and courage that day.
“A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that recognizes one of the most accomplished legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,” he told the crowd in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s appointment when he spoke about the importance of the Republican rise in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
I’m not taking part, but I’m actually taking part,” he said.
“That’s why I’m coming up everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to “resist and hinder us.”
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place by Friday, a top GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is rising
At least 384 people were killed in a major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many of which were swept off the ground when huge waves fell on the beach, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of as many as six meters high hit the ground at the time it began to crumble. Many people collapsed and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach, they didn’t run away immediately and so became the victim of the tsunami,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian Bureau of Natural Disaster Relief (BNPB), said in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, he touched everything on the land," said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had traveled at a speed of 800 km/h over the open sea before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed into a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been confused and collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to be swamped by naschots.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that had fallen in World War II on Hiroshima.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has yet to expand the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
Some of the dead were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, some 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala ‘is completely flat, we have no information at all,’ said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there,” the Red Cross said in a statement. Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” said the Red Cross.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday for not saying it had hit a Palu tsunami, although employees said the waves had reached the country within the time the warning had been given.
In amateur images shared on social media, one can hear a man on the top floor of a building screaming in panic at people on the street down to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water collapses on the coast and buildings and cars are dragged along.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the images.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo planes with supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other basic needs.
The city’s airport is only reopened for assistance and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll rises above 800.
It's very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their office were searching for shelter in deck-rail tents, but were passing along scenes of destruction, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups with the difficult assignment began to launch the emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, goods and personnel from abroad can only be allowed if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial-level disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing stayed hoping that they would find their loved ones’ lives, as in the miracles that people love to hear about terrible natural disasters like this.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, aid workers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon said the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread to the paragliding community and that he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who took part in the beach festival.
In his messages, however, only one grey vignette appeared instead of two blue vignettes.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while supplying ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, $26,750 was stolen from a Brink employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport police press release.
The driver had just rented a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While he was busy, another man ran behind Brink’s employee and stole a bag of money that was ready to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, according to the press release, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators will be asked to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: “The essence that is formally known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been briefly called Ye and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her performance during the show for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator says.
Ye is not only an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, when he told radio presenter Big Boy about the title of his album.
“So it’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
I moved from Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to simply Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He's not the only famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously worked with West, has also worked with and without the label and the capital letters.
Mexican President Promises Not to Use Forces Against Citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against citizens. The country stands on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military force to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military forces opened fire on a peaceful protest on the square, killing as many as 300 people, during which time left-wing student movements erupted throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs due to unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
U.S. to double A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount it spends on A.I. research, says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this following the announcements about A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: the country wants to be number one in the field of AI innovations by 2030.
“Double the A.I. research budget would be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.,” Lee said.
A doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the likelihood that the next major realisation for A.I. will take place in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that defeated the best player of American Othello, and later he was a manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next contest would take place because it would help to discover the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
“China doesn’t pick up our best academics, companies do,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years acquired the best powers of universities to work at A.I.
Lee said U.S. A.I. efforts would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“Those who do PhDs in the field of A.I. should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve partners from industry and academia in the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, U.S. legislation that should lead to the creation of a national safety committee for artificial intelligence has been in the loop for months.
Macedonian voters vote in referendum on possible name change of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of the name of their country to ‘Republic of North Macedonia’, thereby resolving a dispute with Greece that has been going on for decades and Greece would no longer accept the Macedonian application for membership of the European Union.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country is claiming on Greek territory. Consequently, Greece vetoed the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and through a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required rise of at least 50 percent will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot was formulated as follows: ‘Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
“Representatives of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that emerged when the former Yugoslavia disintegrated.
“I will vote today for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, sufficient MPs have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament would be required for the name change.
The National Electoral Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent at the time, compared with 34 percent during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters came to vote.
“I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, during the referendum on the name change of the country that would pave the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
For the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents that had been placed by people boycotting the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a backdoor,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will provide urgently needed investments for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the overwhelming majority is more supportive, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are more supportive of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent would vote yes.
If the referendum is successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defence of Brighton and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short cuts with Brighton's defense at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England. Manchester City won the match 2-0.
It looked like a fluke of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian tip first got the ball played in the middle field.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He was able to pass a defender and was also too fast for some others at the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling waited.
The English striker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right leg to defeat goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told the press.
“We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in the playing field of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a moment and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player taped the ball just before he was too far away.
City will take on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play along and doesn’t make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-offs
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the playoffs, there was little reason to force a fresh start.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still consequences for the Rockies' participation in the playoffs. They are currently one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have won at least one wildcard for the play-off thanks to their 5-2 win against the Nationals last Friday, but they still want to do everything in their power to secure their first division title.
“Although there is nothing left for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver with this audience will be optimal and the other team is probably playing at the highest level I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play in that?”
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to appoint Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was in the yard Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher stands at 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to hold meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while talking about the importance of the Republican rise in the midterm elections.
“Everything we have already achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I’m not taking part, but actually I am taking part. That’s why I come up everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they are determined to take power back into their own hands, no matter what they have to do for it.
It doesn’t matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control, that’s what they want: power and control, but we won’t give them that.”
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “resist and hinder us.”
“And that’s what we’ve seen over the past four days,” he said, calling the Democrats ‘foolish and common and false and deceitful.’
He named the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to loud booing from the audience.
“Do you know what she answered?
Did you like the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a large church.
The party is intolerant of people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour MPs to get that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My fellow Member, Mr Ryan, received a similar treatment because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censure because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues to those in which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
And that was the case during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years I was already a local Labour MP.
Unfortunately, today this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a ‘better, softer’ policy has long been forgotten, if it had ever begun.
It becomes increasingly clear that a dissenting opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political view as I did, suddenly expected me to make a reversal and take a position that I would have never otherwise agreed to, from subjects such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak in front of an audience, whatever I say, there are gossip parties on social media calling for the rejection of my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next election, where the politics of the centre is being thwarted and I am told that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who deal with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that extreme parties are apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘motivation of distrust’ or change of selection rules the party becomes smaller.
I have often been advised over the past two years to keep me silent, not just to proclaim my opinion aloud and then I would ‘not get into trouble’.
But for that I did not go into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago as a school child, provoked by the neglect of Thatcher’s government that literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated for better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as councillor and in my role as minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, not even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy stances and my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who have propagated the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves on to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, and that is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a Member of Parliament for the next elections will not affect me in your view.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: unbeaten Ayr on his way to the top
Two late attempts may have skewed the end result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr is rightfully triumphing in this delightful match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the ranking, the only unbeaten team of the ten.
In the end, it was both their superior defense and their better chances for the home team to win, and coach Peter Murchie could be satisfied.
"We've had a hard time so far in our games and we're still unbeaten, so I'm a happy man," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: ‘All honour to Ayr, they have taken advantage of their opportunities better than we do.’
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but by a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors' match) Melrose was able to get the numbers to speak and Jason Baggot managed to make a comeback.
Climo made a penalty for an extra lead for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solo try just before the break, so it was 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion from Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was long stalled for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on a scorecard, and once the match had restarted, Ayr was able to proceed further by a try by Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then Ayr's lead Blair Macpherson got a yellow card, and again Melrose settled with the extra man when no conversion followed on a Bruce Colvine try at the end of a match where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he tackled Climo without the ball, MacPherson behind the acrimonious Ayr-maul provided a touch-down on the penalty line-out.
Climo made the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe kicked David Armstrong up and sent Gregor Henry away for the fifth try of the home team.
Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is going to the horeca, apparently he's appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts together with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it looks like Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the ‘flowering restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours’: the country-locked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in a docked naval office in La Paz.
An ocean blue flag is waving at public buildings.
At all naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: “The sea is ours.
It’s a duty to win them back.”
Throughout the country, Bolivia is a reminder of the coastline that the country has had to relinquish to Chile after a bloody nineteenth-century commodity conflict, still alive, as is the desire to reconquer the Pacific.
That hope may have reached its highest point in recent decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a ruling by the International Court of Justice, which is due to be tabled on 1 October after five years.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the result with positive prospects,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the Court’s ruling on large screens, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will plead in favor of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of embarrassing talks, is obliged to give Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial campaign for re-election next year, is at stake with Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts are of the opinion that the court will probably not decide in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, little would change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the authority to recognize the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling falls just six months after the final hearing indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive result from Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the last four years may have worsened the situation.
“The case around access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ warlike rhetoric has all the good will that Chile may have yet to fully undermine, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk further afterwards.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other’s countries since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of differences of opinion, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind us.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington can’t trust them.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep up with the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the time that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the ongoing nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s a “utopia” that the permanent sanctions and the U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean war will get North Korea on its knees someday.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking important steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious when it says it would abandon an arsenal that probably sees the country as its only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge headwear, soon to be sold near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized headwear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking set during Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were not to think away from Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their blinding creations on the catwalk.
Valentino’s striking piece was a giant beige hat decorated with a feathery wide edge, which hung over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons filled with gemstones, a wizard’s hat and even an pineapple, but they weren’t designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
For many of the colorful masks, the lips were closed, they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like diving gear, complete with snorkeling and glasses, while the other looked like melted ice.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you are in luck.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats may have been inspired by 'La Bomba', the striped hat with a two-meter wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a striped beach bag that was almost as big as the model in swimsuit that the bag was wearing.
The reddish raffia bag, cut with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather hinge, was the most striking piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection by Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in stores next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories."
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with a series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other initiatives of the whole community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for continued and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can not only trust English when we want to build relationships and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can deduce that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools affiliated with SCIS, shows that 72 percent of the students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of the German students, 69 percent of the French students and 63 percent of the Spanish students also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages are now valued as professional as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the British Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of the obstacles to filling jobs were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if he has learned a second language, he has a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Communicating directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an edge over the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation. French was the only language that stood out above the 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today’s children.
Several languages can speak, especially those of emerging economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools themselves choose which languages they teach.
Some schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the UK as they look ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
It cannot currently be denied that languages in a global business environment remain vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.

LeBron makes his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for LeBron James' first game at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the opening game before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We have to figure out how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than one, and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six games ahead of the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need any games before the season to prepare for me,” he said.
Period of Trump's election rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a long series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia
It will be Trump’s first of five scheduled rallies in the coming week, including stops in places that are prone to him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he chooses for the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been put on hold, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when it is voted in November.
What time does Trump’s rally in West Virginia start tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely have it about the hearings for candidate Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh this week. These were extra-charged now that Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may be waiting for a week to vote on his appointment while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans who are running for the election in November to get more elected.
President Trump’s campaign leadership said these five rallies next week are meant to “stimulate volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“Controlling Congress is so important to his program that the president is traveling to as many states as possible now that the busy campaign season begins,” a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named told Reuters.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep hope alive in the run-up to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging loop of opportunities is a completely invented sports concept, but it is a true belief among players, and especially in competitions like this one.
So who is currently getting the best chances?
“They first had a six-point lead, and now that’s only four more, so we find a little bit of luck on our side right now,” Jordan Spieth said before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of standing for four points, while 12 are at stake.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and scored every three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearsome opponent from tea to green and he sets the right example.
The typical consonant sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he realized a crucial well that made game four a success when he and Thomas were two points behind after two games.
His putt with which she won the match at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind from which you can deduce that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
“You have to dig deep and just worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but delicious European duo has four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Moliwood’ was the only duo that did not play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way in which they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to book a European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
It is, however, premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made shorts with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a setback for the Spaniard and the Swede that they could not get over.
On Sunday, no one will be able to help you recover.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
The European team has played its best so far and has made a good head start in the run-up to the last day, but this four-some session has also shown that Team USA is ready to start the fight, something that some, especially in the US, doubt.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts off with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After Saturday’s four-ball and foursomes they are 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The named duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two wins more than Tiger Woods, who had a hard time making them four points ahead of Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who would like to return the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, was stronger than the burgeoning Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but could no longer catch up with its backlog.
Jim Furyk’s team must score eight points during Sunday’s 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed ‘Molliwood’, after a sensational weekend are only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup to win four points in their four opening games.
After joining Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully interspersed and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a brilliant set, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's number one and three, with 2&1.
Yet it did not run from a rental roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze to the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans by three points on Saturday.
They won after a difficult match with 2&1 from Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch a four-point deficit at the beginning of the singles, although Furyk’s team has enough to equalise, as they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But now that they've been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea says it will ‘in no case’ unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions lead to growing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could not in any case give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the site for nuclear tests, and promising not to nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see a similar response from the US,” he said.
“Without any trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
Although Ri repeated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as it takes further steps, it was noted that he did not a priori reject unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had earlier done.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the very first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump vowed to give assurances of bail.
North Korea aims for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. urges ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to reach their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions only reinforce our distrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the U.S. leader did at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the other party were to be denuclearized South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Coke would not be a threat.
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different than last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles would be aimed at the American mainland after ‘Mr. Evil President’ Trump Kim a ‘missile man’ on a suicide no.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim this year at the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much still needs to be done and that sanctions should continue to denuclearize until North Korea.
Trump said on Wednesday that he had no timetable for this: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council’s sanctions must continue vigorously and firmly until we have achieved the full, definitive, verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has implemented unanimity sanctions against North Korea to greatly reduce funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to make preparations for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Just hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, North Korea considered him setting “gang-like demands.”
North Korea promised this month during a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “comprehensive measures” he wanted were security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
One professor stated that students of the world’s largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist connected to Brigham and Women's Hospital, presented the course. As far as he knows, this is unique in the United States.
He got the idea to start the course after he gave a speech about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing this now, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is organized for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was determined that students had a serious sleep deficit during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections, students see an image of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise devices and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine in sleeping.
In another section, participants will hear how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Using a map of the campus, with interactive pictograms, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that with this, we will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we think they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what consequences the choice of cigarettes has on their health, added Czeisler.
The culture of pride on a night of studying still exists, he says, and because of modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep deprivation is an increasing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep, of good quality, should be the student’s ‘secret weapon’ to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes the brain to give them a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler set up the course. He had taken lessons with the professor in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before coming to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, and not only an alarm to get up. They should also be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, allowing you to have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to defeat Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their exits run again disappointingly when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox's team hoped for a first win during a draw since they defeated St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team managed to win, almost Gerrard's second as manager in 18 games. His team now stands eight points behind the Premiership at Hearts, who lost to Hearts.
Menga scored on seven minutes for the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston is up to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more trouble, as border guard Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently throwing an object at him by the supporters of the visiting team.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, beating Ayr and going to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt remained at the same eleven for Livingston, who knew the Hearts cut a point last week. He would have been uptight about how his well-trained team managed to block the opponents at each set.
The Rangers may have owned most of the ball, but Livingston did more with it.
They had already scored after two minutes, when Menga gave up the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the goal, but the midfielder could not finish it.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached forward Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked against the rear pole.
The Rangers did manage to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than really believing in it if they could get closer to the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found in any case that he was entitled to a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless clashed after playing a quarter, but divorce judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were only able to shoot twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who used to be a target at the Ibrox, was able to easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's headball and Ovie Ejaria's empty shot.
Livingston’s opener in the 34th minute may or may not be in the extension of the overall course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it was just for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers had not grown up against Jacobs' deep playing pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who remained cool-blooded and picked out Menga, who easily stepped the ball into the goal.
Gerrard made a break with the change Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This set had almost immediate consequences when the winger Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly racet from his line away to stop the ball.
But Livingston kept forcing the visitors to play the kind of game that Livingston likes to play, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to score long balls.
Holt's team had been able to increase his lead in the final phase of the game, but McGregor held up well and blocked off Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invader Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a penalty kick at the end of the match after an encounter with Jacobs, but Thomson was already looking the other way.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the almanac of our ‘Sunday Morning’: 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom good can TELL... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geigerteller.
The geigerteller has since become an icon in pop culture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film starring unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘What the hell is that?’
Rogers: ‘It’s a geigerteller. It’s used to track down radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up this headphones, you hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: “It’s really kicking right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.

In the method, immune cells are removed in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adapted so that they can ‘see’ the HER2 protein, which is common in all types of cancer, and then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way of removing immune cells from patients and ‘teaching’ these cells to tackle cancer cells turned out to be already working on the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West quits pro-Trump tyrade and wears MAGA-pet after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
It didn’t go as he had hoped.
Kanye West was evicted during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would become a presidential candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a cap on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he dropped a tirade against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white man, he asks, ‘How can you have sympathy for Trump now? He’s a racist!’
When I was worried about racism, I had long since left America,” he said.
Saturday Night Live's broadcast began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon stabbed the dragon with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with the alleged assault that Christine Blasey Ford accuses him of.
West's tirade was not broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It's not clear if Rock wants to stick the dragon with West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken backstage under fire for his hat.
“They’ve been harassing me.
They said, ‘Don’t step on the stage with that cap.’
They've been harassing me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see how apathetic she looks?’ He said that he would attract her superman-cape, ‘because that means you can’t recommend me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love."
From the audience came booing at least twice and the cast members of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine got from an attendee: ‘The whole studio was suddenly silent.’
West was guest as last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our bravest minds: THANK YOU TO THE MASSA TROTSEERT.’
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just “just herself, and that’s beautiful.”
“But I choose not to reward someone who harms, supports and expropriates an ideology in my community (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We did too, she added.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on, he is, he says, ‘the essence that is formally known as Kanye West’.
He is not the first artist to change his name; he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg also bore the name Snoop Lion and the late music-loving Prince once changed his name to a symbol and then into The artist formerly known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder after stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Police Court on Monday.
The charge will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington takes to toxic manhood
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor picks up on the stereotype of the macho hero and says that when young guys see such roles on the screen, they often think they have to be tough to get respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thinks “something has gone wrong” and asked himself how the problem of toxic masculinity should be addressed in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
“This is a really important question for me personally at the moment: where did it go wrong with our manhood?” he said.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, which is why we are now faced with this problem?"
Kit thinks that television might be partly responsible for the rise of toxic manhood, due to its very male characters.
He continued, “What was born and what was learned?”
What is taught on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that’s one of today’s big questions: how do we change that?
“There’s clearly something wrong with young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not appear in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones when the series ends next summer, because he is ‘ready with battlefields and horses’.
Starting in November, Kit will play a revival of Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a rapist.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks his encounter with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the series, so that's how I kept my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health agencies say more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was previously not the case.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
Because of conservative values of country, according to studies, an estimated 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often, the diseases are transmitted by insufficient protection in the sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has been promising universal access to HIV medication as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member leaked data from Republican senators and pulls out on ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘complet theories’
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters is against allegations that one of her staff members has posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that the allegations are spread by “extreme right” scams and websites.
“Lies, lies and even more common lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include, among other things, the private address and private phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate committee on the allegations of sexual misconduct at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and contained the information of a Waters employee, the Hill said.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a blatant lie," Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and safety have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, was under no circumstances responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a blatant lie."
Waters’ statement quickly came under criticism online, among others by former White House press officer Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial sounds angry,’ wrote Fleischer.
“You can imagine from here that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a Congressman.
If someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He doesn't have to be rebellious.
He must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are made known,” she said, “and that they are legally held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again - Weak Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British accent, we now traditionally look for references to Brexit, and that proves to be true of this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films with a loose spy in the lead role, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English.
Is this airy self-satisfaction about how bad we make it the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with exhausting eyes and flexible facial features manages to send everything in the hundred, even with his second comeback. From his name you can already deduce that he is a general comic character that was conceived for cinemagoers in countries where one speaks a different language than English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a little Clouseau, a little Mr Bean, and a little green of that guy who contributed one note to the theme song of Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man Atkinson once played in Barclaycard’s TV spots (who have all been forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves behind a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I found it wonderful how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor blades tickle against his helmet.
Atkinson can show well in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough, especially now the "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do well.
The humor seems to be intended for children rather than adults, and Johnny English’s crazy rampage comes to me less original and focused than the unwritten jokes of the character Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is now that Britain is in great difficulty.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making the identity of all active secret agents of Britain known, to the great dismay of the agent in office, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That’s the drop that makes the bucket overflow from the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems to her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character that reminds of Teresa May, but the script doesn’t offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisors, she needs to employ a retired spy, as every active spy is compromised.
And that means the stunner Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic institution, but teaches unofficially about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the spy lessons of English make something of School or Rock.
English is quickly offered at Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former grieving assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of an undersear, a restless and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine’s level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are therefore back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloodthirsty femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister unfortunately falls for the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of witty doll fun: dressed as opers they set a careful French restaurant on fire, they throw herry aboard the luxury yacht of Volta and English unleash pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta.
For that last one, all the registers are opened, but no matter how well-intentioned and turbulent the scene is, she does some thinking of children's television.
It's not all very original.
And like the other Johnny English films, I ask myself: can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors Rowan Atkinson’s talent?
Labour denies that the party is contemplating a plan whereby Britons work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party would consider a radical plan whereby Britons work four days a week but get paid for five days.
It is alleged that the party would like the bosses of companies to pass on the savings they make as a result of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to their employees by giving them an extra day off.
For example, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea “fits” into the party’s economic agenda and plans to overwhelm the country’s balance in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day workweek has already been approved by the Trade Unions Association, which finds it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen from one moment to the next, but a four-day workweek is a goal that fits within the party’s drive to strike the balance in the economy more for the benefit of the workers and that also fits within the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given the fact that the Green Party had already promised a four-day working week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the effort is not yet supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not a party policy proposal and is not considered by the party either."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used Labour’s conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the “faceless drivers” and the “profiters” at utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not regain the full value of their share, as a Labour government could apply “rebates” based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees on the board of directors of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds, which will give 10 percent of the shares of private sector firms to employees who can earn up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the FBI’s findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview broadcast Sunday at 60 Minutes, Rep. Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that could lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I told the hearing that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, however, seems to stand firm against the wall.
“My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the charge should contain dynamite,” he said.
“As for Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will perform and that has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was organized for the first time in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
Concertgoers who want to get a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as performing volunteer work, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or in another meaningful way.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, going with another 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to call for action or is this just another form of ‘clitivism’, giving people the feeling that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen, more than 19 million ‘actions’ of supporters have been registered, which were aimed at a large number of different goals.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have contributed to global leaders’ commitment and policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that need to change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or brought together by sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds so far have had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important declarations of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the UK with the aim of "helping children realize their full potential". This group has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Globals.
“With the help of the British government, donors, other national governments and global citizens like you, we can make a footnote in history of the social injustice that is malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, told the audience during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the British government was asked to improve the nutrition situation for mothers and children, the government has announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, to support reaching 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen’s website, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The group replied: "It will be a long and difficult road, where we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, just like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will ultimately be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform this year at the New York event presented by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy for a 'blockade' to block Russian energy exports - Minister of Home Affairs
Washington can "take refuge if necessary" to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Affairs, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
"The United States has that capability, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke for guests during an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that displays itself as the "voice of energy consumption" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to Russia’s approach to Iran, noting that they do not differ substantially.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use of and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a country that only knows a 'art', with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to boost the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a country that by far offers the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, officials of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw sight from the 'inappropriate' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump of Berlin, has made Moscow's 'prisoner'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s powerful opposition to the project is only driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers themselves should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has sparked a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously about it' to take part in the 2020 presidential election, says Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday she was "seriously thinking" about taking part in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering taking part in the elections.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means that a woman is in the top position,” she said, according to the political newspaper The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider putting myself in the position of president.”
Warren was running against President Donald Trump during the meeting in the town hall and said he was “sending this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m so worried about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been open-minded in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we should wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this."
However, a poll published Thursday found that a majority of Warren’s own supporters believe she should not run for election in 2020.
Eighty-five percent of the “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not stand for election, according to an opinion poll from the Suffolk University’s Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Twenty-two percent of the vote was for her to be elected.
The study showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent before a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with a possible participation in the 2020 presidential election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin Talks About Track Palin’s PTSD During Donald Trump’s Election Meeting
Track Palin, 26, has spent a year in Iraq after he took office in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence Monday night.
“By what my own son has to experience, what he is experiencing now that he is back, I understand for other families that are experiencing the effects of PTSD and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience who was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and have become harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other soldiers have given for the homeland".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and has been charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. that will deny asylum to victims who are on the run for gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. filed a statement last Friday as "friend-of-the-court" to the Washington court in support of an asylum seeker who opposes this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been announced.
She says her partner “and his violent sons who are members of a gang” have abused her but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The attorneys of the states that support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people have come who apply for asylum in the U.S., as countries that are experiencing major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals, in which it became possible for immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “neglects decades of state, federal and international law.”
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" is stated in a statement by the 'friend-of-the-court'.
The lawyers continue to argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the U.S. harms the U.S. economy, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provides the necessary workforce'.
Jeff Sessions, the minister of justice, in June ordered judges no longer to grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
“Asylum is available to those fleeing their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in its announcement on June 11 of the policy.
Asiel was never meant to alleviate all problems, even if these problems are serious, which people get to deal with every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was also getting worse.
“It feels very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she tried to comfort her short-sighted baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
A clean water is scarce".
Residents returned to their ruined homes and searched for valuables in their overnight possessions that they could still use.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals are overcrowded, as far as they are not damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Richter's scale.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has had a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the possibility of severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the remains of a wall,” Haris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, and later I heard nothing more.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of 'Intimidation' With 'Propaganda Ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page ad in an American newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last referred to the paid appendix to China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most-selling newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of meddling in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, an accusation that is denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a escalating trade war, in which they have imposed increasingly higher import tariffs on each other.
China’s retaliation rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states such as Iowa, who support Trump’s Republican Party, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
“China,” Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, “is now doubling the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the government of China is using the freedom of expression and of a free press, a long cherished tradition in America by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at a kiosk in the center of Beijing you will find disparate voices and you will not see a true reflection of the diverse views that the Chinese people have possible about the difficult economic path, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to publish his article", if he did not say which newspaper this was.
Through the Kavanaugh debacle, the Republicans alienated female voters from themselves just before the midterm elections, warning analysts
Now many important Republicans are scouring Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defending him against various accusations of sexual violence, warning analysts that they will suffer a setback, especially among women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around this subject have grown enormously, and most Republicans have already made it known that they want to go through with the vote.
“These things cannot be reversed,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article that appeared Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering if Senator Jeff Flake’s attempt to appeal for an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to satisfy the bad voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget it in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the hall of the Senate while the Republicans who controlled the Justice Committee chose to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record high,” Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high, and that’s true.
But it can go even further, especially among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often do not vote even though they do not agree with the president.”
Even for Ford’s public testimony, in which she further explained her allegation of sexual harassment against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans were to push through the nomination.
“This has become a confusing mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former Republican Party chairman, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in the committee, or about the final vote or that Kavanaugh takes place in the court, but it's also about the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they've treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that doesn't help Democrats sell it.
The Americans, however, turn out to be divided on the question of who they believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority signing off on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony for sure or likely, and that 35 percent believe Kavanaugh for sure or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s lead, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s accusations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had touched her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals during a party during the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that ‘world domination’ is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to make their own ‘personal online data storage’ or POD.
It can store lists of contacts, activity lists, an agenda, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt is according to CEO John Bruce that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers who have contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not going to hold talks with “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that puts all their business models at once completely on their heads.”
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the “mission (of Inrupt) is to deliver the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: spiritual and bearer of the Victoria Cross from WO I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England to have acquired a Victoria Cross during World War I as a military officer is honored 100 years later at his birthplace.
Lieutenant Colonel, the Honourable Bernard Vann received the distinction following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper, so he never knew he had received the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the small zones, Michael Vann, said it was “brilliant symbolic” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire of field fire and machine guns".
He later stormed into the line of fire and led the line forward before only running to a field shot and shutting out three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never tap into, but also something that makes me feel humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann have also put on a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he “felt very honored to be able to play a role in the parade,” adding that “the bravery of a real hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people.”
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you’ve been up all night watching a haunted Bellator 206 and you won’t see the most important moment.
The San Jose landing ticket featured 13 battles, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, viewers in the UK were pleasantly surprised when the channel switched on Peppa Pig.
Some were outraged because they had stayed up all night especially for this fight.
A fan described the transition to the children’s program on Twitter as “a bad joke”.
"According to government regulations, after 6:00 a.m. in the morning, no content may be shown that is not suitable for children, and therefore we had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked for the broadcast.
"Pepa the pig, yessss."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said they are going to adjust their programming to ensure that viewers in the UK will also have a chance in the future.
"I think, in terms of the rematch, that we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, there were a lot of text messages going around again and again and believe me, these weren’t all as friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise you this won't happen a second time.
We limited the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels ‘inferior’ because of his sexual orientation
Olympic sprinter Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to become successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said he didn’t realize, until he went to further education, that “not everyone is like me.”
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out on gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that the parenting had contributed to the fact that he attached less value to winning at the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show has taken a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a shift on Laverne’s first program, Daley told him that during his youth he felt “less” than others because it was “socially not accepted to like both girls and boys.”
He said: “To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was ‘someone’ so that he wouldn’t disappoint people if they finally found out about his attitude.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaign leader for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, “has completely surprised me.”
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’re so young you have to endure so much,” he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of fourteen and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had already received the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say, you're not going to be there anymore to sit on the front row, Dad," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stopped and he died, I could finally admit that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I knew I'd been dreaming about this all my life, diving for a home crowd at the Olympics, there's no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first musical choice, Proud by Heather Small, that had strongly attacked him on his way to the games and where he still got chicken fur from.
Desert Island Discs can be heard on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he must find his form to avoid making it a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who is participating for the 12th time in the two-year event, a record, was placed on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors splits the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, in an attempt to figure out what it’s missing.
Because he was never even at the peak of his career known for his straight drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for Le Golf National’s narrow fairways, where the long grass of the roughs lingering balls routinely punishes.
And if the job itself isn’t scary enough, in the ninth match on Sunday, the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, comes up against that linked to newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of the matches this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind at the start of the 12 single matches start well, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has proven to have confidence in this man, although he could honestly be difficult otherwise.
“He fully understood the role he had today, hit me on the back, hit his arm around me and said he’s ready for it tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has been in the Hall of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably wouldn’t have expected him to play two games.
I expected more of it, but it's how it is and it's the way we were supposed to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo’s record for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never fully matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games in his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain irrefutable impact on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to get jokes out with people and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to keep him crazy from time to time last week, which was fun to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game.”
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that big advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead ahead of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup, can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
De Deen made his debut in the Valderrama match in 1997, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only,” said Bjorn, who had won the light of 2018 with 5-3 on Friday and 10 for Golf.
So history shows me and everyone else in the team that this is not yet a game played.
Everyone will have to make a full effort tomorrow.
Get to work and execute the plan on the right one.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that’s winning this trophy, and that’s what we need to keep focusing on.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
He added: "I would never go forward in this area if I were happy about the performance of his players on a challenging golf course.
Tomorrow there will be another challenge.
Tomorrow the individual performance will come to order, and that is a very different discipline.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when it’s going well, but when you’re alone, your golfing skills are really only being tested.
That’s the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform individually better than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of reversal on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
“I remember every damn word of that speech,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had summoned his players for the final day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or like in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there is a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We’ve aligned our line-up on this and are sending the men on their way in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we’re going to try to conjure something out of the high hat tomorrow.”
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the counteroffensive and puts Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the squad.
“I chose this group in this order because I think we are so constantly covered,” said Bjorn from his selection of singles.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have come into service in 2014 to replace the obsolete Cold War-era warships, but it will take at least one more year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The start-up of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to be part of the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class that the Navy ordered in 2007 serve to replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to insert the latest frigates up to two years behind each other, far away from the home ports.
The continuing delays, however, mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already obsolete by the time they are put into operation, Die Zeit notes.
The fatal frigate F125 had already caught the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that would render the warship useless if it were deployed on a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship is suffering from serious overweight, which will reduce performance and limit the capabilities of the navy to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Palatinate' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, becomes even a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest frigates have in their grip become extra important due to the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is declining.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defense committee in Germany, admitted that the navy actually "has a shortage of deployable ships".
The official said the problem over time as a snowball grew, as old ships were taken out of business but no replacement ships were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were yet available to be included in the navy.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
New research conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, follows the common and small dwarf bat, the brown large-breed bat, and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to follow the activities of the bats throughout the season.
Employees of the NTS and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the crevices of the bat and what kind of thing it does.
Then a map of the habitat and a report are produced to make a detailed picture on a landscape scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s nature conservation advisor, hopes the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making pastures and how we can best maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Fleer mouse populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning bolts can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and home cat attacks.
In reality, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is taking bats very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who regularly investigate, carry out inspections of sleeping places, and sometimes rescue actions.
The organisation has even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland’s ten bat species live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for the bats.
"Here in Threadave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much about bats not yet known and that is why the work we do here and in other locations will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of controlling bats before maintenance work is carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping place can lead to the death of 400 female bats and their boy, potentially wiping out a full local population.
Bats are a protected species of animal and it is illegal to kill them, to fall prey or to disturb them or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and from many of our species we simply don't know yet how to deal with their populations."
Ronaldo Rejects Accusations of Assault as His Lawyers Prepared to Pursue a German Journal
Cristiano Ronaldo has called allegations of assault “fake news” and said people “want to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly newspaper Der Spiegel, in which the allegations have been published.
The head of Portugal and Juventus is accused of assaulting an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of having paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, just hours after the allegations were reported, called the reports "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today is fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
“They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the profession.
I am a happy man, and through and through good," added the footballer, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called “an unacceptable reporting of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the footballer wants compensation for the "moral damage to an amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the footballer’s room, where he allegedly raped her anal, as can be read in the indictment filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that for '99 percent' he was a 'good guy', but that he is sometimes left behind that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had had sex, but that this was mutually agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos were taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court arrangement because she was "feared of the consequences" and because she was concerned about the "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now says she wants to invalidate the scheme because she is permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to leave Manchester United for Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and this summer left for the Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret it forever’ as automakers leave UK
The UK "will forever regret it" if it loses its status as world leader in auto production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was “worrying” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain would leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily shut down production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a "no-deal Brexit" jobs would cost.
The factory in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My vision is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory fall out,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other automotive products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also revealed their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement for the functioning of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for one month after Brexit.
Most car manufacturers worry about risks in the supply chain in the event of a ‘no-deal Brexit’.
Toyota’s production line is based on the ‘just-in-time’ principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars placed on order.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there can be unrest at the borders that, according to industry, can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota cannot store more than one day of stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in that case production would be discontinued.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was “exactly tailored to avoid those checks at the border.”
"We need to have a deal, we want to have the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also seize this opportunity," he told listeners of BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company’s competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is a representative of the union Unite at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs have been lost, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could be delayed once again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week" as the fight over the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and possible obstruction of the presidential process.
The question of whether Trump is going to fire the deputy attorney general and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence has been going on for months now.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to dismiss the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors circulated that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he did not want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both be involved.
On Friday, Trump gave the FBI orders to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote in the full Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump’s chief press officer, appeared on Fox News.
Asked to the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set yet, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by a reluctance of the "attention" TV journalists, though, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
“The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any president for him,” she said, without providing evidence for this: “We’ve looked at the figures.”
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do that a lot and you’ve seen us do that often in the past few weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public sessions or during press conferences with dignitaries visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president possibly demonstrated why, he made an open-hearted and sometimes bizarre appearance for the assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The Minister of Health has written a letter to EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and desire to continue working with the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already stated its willingness to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
But at the same time, the UK government has also scrapped preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the NHS’s work and provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is firmly and certainly your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation yesterday after he suffered a head injury in the 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennesseen's Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and fell more or less into it," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff immediately gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are yet known about the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury has occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was tackled a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making him tackled a total of 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when buying a house in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless according to new Conservative plans
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn’s success to attract young voters
The increase in the number of vacancies will be raised for people who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when they buy a house in the UK and the extra income is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success that attracts young voters with promises to ensure more affordable homes and tell this to earners.
The increase of the vacancy is raised on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra income being invested in an effort by the government to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes on top of the current vacancy, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and houses purchased for rent, can go up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in this way.
An estimated 13 per cent of new construction in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foothold on the housing ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically "spook cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson had pleaded for a reduction in the number of doctors to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping prices high by buying land and not using it, and he called on May to scrap quotas on affordable homes to restore the ‘housing shame’ in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a striking series of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to the 'no negligence' suspension.
He also wants to give local governments more opportunities to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I wanted to spend my time as prime minister on the recovery of the ‘British Dream’, that life is getting better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that it is as simple for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy houses here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become too vague a dream and the humiliation of living without a roof over their heads is too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says it’s his “ultimate ambition” to ever become a manager of Scotland.
De Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from northeast England, currently in third place in League One, on three points from first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after returning to the Scottish Premiership the previous season.
“As a footballer, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B-team and that was the end of it,” Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“When I was a child, I often saw my father playing in Hampden Park and it’s something that keeps attracting me.
However, that opportunity would only come when I am successful in managing a club.”
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated into becoming the successor to these established names at a major club, rather he had previously refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me is measured at the moment by ‘can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Because of the structure and facilities of this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful if I bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years into his career as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the verge of degradation to winning the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a crossroads,” he recalled the moment he took over the leadership at Alloa.
“I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I did the best well, I earned fairly well and have known a few reasonable highlights.
But football can be tough.
There are a lot of things that you face every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the profession, but management just feels good.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I’m real, I’m as good on my skin as I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, reveals research
The heat wave in the summer has increased the incomes of British pubs that are struggling to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but revenue in restaurants was 4.8 percent lower, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s business advisory firm, which has collected the figures, said: “Previous sunshine and the fact that England is more than expected to participate in the world championships, meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs were now spending 2.8 percent more on that restaurant turnover.
The drop of 1.8 percent in restaurant sales in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that are focused on liquor sales performed by far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also focused on the sale of food are also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems that people only went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, beverage sales were 6.6 percent higher for the month, while food sales were 3 percent lower.”
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for revenue in the exit market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a fall in turnover of 4.8 percent year-on-year is particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for operators focused on food, and only time will tell if the more moderate temperatures of August can give it that much needed breath.”
The total sales growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK’s sales monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector, performance data is collected and analyzed from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. This is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they keep hidden from their parents.
One in five children, some not older than 11 years, has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, a survey reveals.
Survey of 20,000 High School Students Revealed Growth in ‘False Insta Pages’
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a ‘main account’ that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not older than 11 years, make social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in the ‘false Insta accounts’, a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean ‘main account’ that they show to their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally arrived at the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered there a teenager who asked others to rape her.
The study, which was conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half admitted to maintaining personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are being lured to create online spaces where they’re not found by their parents and teachers.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of the Scottish Athletics World, as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and chairman Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the drivers of the sport to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are confident that the athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from her election to the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am happy to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help drive the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It has been terribly hard work, but I am now fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the support!"
Advertising for breast pump in which mothers are compared with cows, shares online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has shared the online opinion with an ad in which nursing mothers are compared to cows that are milked.
To mark the introduction of what is called “the quietest portable breast pump in the world,” Elvie, a consumer technology producer, has released an ironic, music-inspired ad to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to expectant mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like, ‘Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see anything about it’ and ‘In case you didn’t notice it, these are not owls, these are my breasts’.
The chorus then continues with: 'Pumps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's'.
However, the ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, immediately caused an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has sparked hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that the ‘horror’ of the dairy industry is being compensated for.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they have to be expected and fall in love to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days of giving birth," the statement said.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly in a feeding bag (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else remarked, “This is, of course, traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don’t we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another person added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song "hilarious".
“I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
That pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't looked too much for it.
“This is a great product,” someone wrote.
Someone else had the following remark: "This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who are snoring (often at work or in a toilet) and then feel like they're just 'cooking'.
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you will see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their beha's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who are bullied sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a feeding bag, so women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on the go.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: “The Elvie Pump is a highly revolutionary product that deserves a tough and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between expectant mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to put the flask and the associated challenges in the spotlight and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump is getting the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski’s catwalk while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children has reached a peak, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the hard-frozen rhetoric and hard-frozen policies introduced by the Trump administration make it harder to bring children under sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to risk their own chances of staying in the country by signing up for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households should issue their fingerprints and that this data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in a testimony to Congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as a sponsor for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
We are persecuting these people,” Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials have introduced new rules, which obliges some of them to appear before the court within one month of the start of detention, rather than within 60 days, which was the standard, according to the employees at the shelter.
Many of them will stand before the court via a video conference, rather than in person, to advocate their application for legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered to be eligible for assistance will be deported soon.
The longer the children remain in custody, the greater the chance of them becoming anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or flight attempts, according to the staff at the shelter and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are ignored more often, due to the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish 'occupational forces' to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem has also called for the return of Syrian refugees, even as the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign troops were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "this will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue with “this sacred struggle until we have liberated all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and from a “possible illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly engaged in training and advising the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs who are fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were favorable for their return and he denounced "some Western countries spreading irrational fears", leaving most refugees away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return,” he said.
“They are politicizing a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the rebels’ last major stronghold, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has diverted a large-scale attack from Russian-backed Syrian troops in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and said he hoped the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be wiped out."
Staffan de Mistura, the UN delegate, hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made clear what the conditions are for the Syrian government to participate in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many 'liberal' viewers are likely to hope, his presidency is prematurely terminated by a dismissal procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be ‘the most dramatic final of a presidency ever’.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of eye fatigue.
Since 2014, the viewership figures during ‘prime-time’ at CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC's 'The Rachel Maddow Show' is at the top of ratings for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on nights with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who is responsible for the ABC drama 'Designated Survivor', a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on television, the storylines coming from Washington may influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being a well-informed citizen, when you notice that you have been watching for six hours a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', which has implied the jack of peacocks by Paul's peacock.
I will never be able to watch Super Mario the same way again.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's a reality show, in part, he's putting you up with something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating cast of the Trump show and the day-to-day plot changes.
You can’t afford to miss an episode or you have the idea you’re running behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside to watch MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not get out of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I remember doing all those weird shows, not so long ago, and people saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows in the most exciting midterm elections for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th district sees an influx of money, thanks to a redeployment of an electoral district that requires two sitting people’s representatives to fight for the same seat.
The newly reclassified district of Pittsburg meets Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take it up against another sitting popular representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The maps were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally categorized ('gerry petition') in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knockout in the field of campaign funding between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a sharp victory in a well-regarded special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
This seat was occupied by a Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points difference.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The U.S. is considering punishing El Salvador for support of China and has refrained from doing so
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners set up the Trump Organization management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the U.S. foreign ministry's spokesman.
But penalties were only considered in the case of El Salvador, as the country received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials set up a high-level conference that would focus on security and economic well-being as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent states from moving forward.
But in mid-September, some top government officials announced that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible criminal measures against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now for Vice President Mike Pence to deliver a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further lifting, without harsh messages about Washington’s criminal measures.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Studying the history
The next step may be the report of special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counteraction of the justice by Trump, for which serious evidence has now become public.
Mueller will likely also focus his research on co-operation between Trump’s campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If Congress changes color, Trump must hold himself accountable for that institution, just as he prepares to turn back to the voters, and perhaps he must go and hold a jury accountable in a court of law.
That’s a lot, and I don’t want to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor that of its equivalents in Europe.
Choices will have to be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, who will determine how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to perform a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and thus missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such bending points, and the inevitable rise of democracy is thereby accelerated or slowed down.
Americans are currently facing several of these types of bending points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this magazine reported that, last year, he had suggested to record conversations with the president in secret and that he had speculated on the president’s suitability for office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is not correct.
“How will we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of assault and an unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that Trump will call to account?
If we fail these tests, democracy awaits a very long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my embassy residence.
She survived it, immigrated to America and sent me, 60 years later, away to light candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika is depicted.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will get Rapid Wien to visit on Thursday and know that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive tie in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
With a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans was unable to play his first game of the season until the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for better results.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good eleven,” the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the game with the idea that something to win fell and the game came out with a point.
Maybe we could have won at the end, but the whole game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can score three points but it will be a difficult match because they also had a good result in their last match, but if the audience is behind us, I am sure that we can push through and that we can achieve a positive result.
Last year has certainly been tough, of all that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feelgood factor on the club.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can push through now, leave the last season behind and be successful again.”
Women can't sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of the way they want to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps necessary to have this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where we'll start.
Talk to your spouse(s) and the children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t make your wishes public on time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Take a financial advisor in hand: Your advisor can also give you advice on how you can pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care financing choices, including a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or use your own assets as insurance, as long as you have money.
Set up your legal documents: Avoid legal battle when insurance needs to be used.
Make sure that you have a full power of health care so that you can appoint a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and make sure that the professionals stick to your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Also consider a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that the invoices are paid if you can’t do it yourself anymore.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Attach these details to a written plan so that you have the information at hand.
“It’s not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes along.”
Man shot several times with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air force gun as he walked home after an evening out.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove near Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'voluntary act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Because the means of communication have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches for more than 300 km along the northwest coast of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region just under one province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebes, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been hit regularly by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami struck in western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the worst earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Atjeh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 on the Richter scale occurred south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, and caused a tsunami that struck the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 on the Richter scale struck the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of more than 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed around 300 lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie regency in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by falling buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on domestic violence charge
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, meddling in a report of domestic violence and offering opposition during the arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged rapes, he took her phone off.
Palin is being held in custody in the Mat-Su house with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, sure to know" when asked this, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which means he can be sentenced to up to one year in prison and up to a maximum fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offence, which is punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of abusing his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now for the Veterans Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic abuse, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veteran group after she linked her son’s violent behavior to PTSD, which he allegedly committed to his time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down while the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, which is northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for suspect in New York City terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the New York City terror attack, in which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that has not been implemented in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, allegedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, driving pedestrians and cyclists who came on his way around in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious physical injuries, according to the intent statement requiring the death penalty, which was filed in the Southern New District.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document filed with the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the indictment with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against the organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and preparation," according to the prosecutors, and they described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as "cruel, cruel and corrupt."
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevitj Sajpov has inflicted injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pangnucco" states the intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been more than ten years since there was a case in the Southern District of New York demanding the death penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not give evidence of remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He let the investigators know that he felt good about his act, she told the police.
Sajpov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecutors' decision.
“We think the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a conviction in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned,” Patton said.
The defense of Sajpov had earlier asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Lead Brexit Negotiations <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Nigel Farage promised today to “mobilize a people’s army” during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
Ukip’s former leader said politicians should feel the “hot” of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested giving him the lead in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants at the march in Birmingham that the UK “would have been out already” if Mr Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge that May faces in reconciling the heavily divided ranks is highlighted by two conservatives who are pro-Remains and who are taking part in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep up with her Chequers compromise while this is being attacked by Brexiters, Remainers and the EU.
Complainants agreed that she would continue and try to conclude a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, forcing Eurosceptici and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone told a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to throw 'Chequers in the trash can'.
He suggested that Farage should be knighted and be held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he did the job, we'd be out of it now," Bone said.
The MP for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers in the trash."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone pointed out suggestions by hand that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British population has changed their minds and wants to remain in the EU is completely false."
Conservative Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists going door-to-door and making sure we are elected.
Let the Chequers fall and listen."
In a targeted message to May, she added: “Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the meeting that politicians should "feel the heat" if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to say to them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with this.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic masses, he added: “I want you to set our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, on fire.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country that has given us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have again become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham and ended this March with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists waving flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after setting up this group over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the House of Lords for Labour, made jokes about the security problems of a Conservative party app at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘think well’ about presidential candidacy
Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "think well about her candidacy for the presidency" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, a Republican deputy who was co-chair of Trump’s campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been at the center of speculation that she might start the fight with Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
An attendee asked her if she would stand for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to restore our flawed government and that includes a woman at the top."
LSU's Wayde Sims Arrested After Death
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the shooting of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, during an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been interrogated and known to have been present at the scene of the crime, possessing a firearm and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and held in custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 meters who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started the last season in 10 games. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel has left him the win after team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’ team orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold when he defended his position and Vettel invited his teammate to attack.
Vettel went into the pits and left Hamilton in the crowded drive in the group's tail, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on top after a wheel-on-wheel action which forced the Ferrari rider to release space with inverse space on the inside after a double movement in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was a long time leader of the race, because he stayed with his tyre selection and mixed on fast finish, so he could pick up Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Eventually he went to the pits in the 44th round, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen was fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his best all weekend, he was a real gentleman and left me behind.
The team has done their best for places one and two," Hamilton said.
It wasn’t a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday over the fact that she persisted not being the source of the leaked letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly talk about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead he made it known that what happened in the Senate showed that people can be "common, dishonest and dishonest."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and common and mean and untruthful," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and then they say 'oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you like it?
Do you know her answer... did you read the document - 'Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lie."
Well, wait a minute.
“We didn’t,” he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter in which the charges at Kavanaugh's address were mentioned was sent to Feinstein by Ford and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was leaking.
“I didn’t keep Dr. Ford’s allegations hidden, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go with it confidentially and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked."
But the president did not believe her denial, and he commented on it during the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you what, that wasn't a good body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, who is accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power, with all the necessary means.
You see the community, the uneasiness, they give nothing to who they hurt, who they have to drive to seize power and regain control," the president said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have cleared Friday’s loss in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had two goals to lead by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team along, before Dwyer brought the Giants back in charge.
Francois Bouchard made the equaliser for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's men, who had to make up a setback on Friday night to then defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the lead to Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants took the first rest with a lead, when he made his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team recovered and Bouchard brought them back to an equal position with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He managed to win with the fifth goal for his team, halfway into the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies as he makes sure hundreds of people can escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that an aircraft with hundreds of people on board could safely land.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that subsequently caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many have been buried below the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild-moving traffic tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to ensure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was ready for takeoff at the time, could ascend safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower, when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear that," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities feared that the death toll could rise to thousands and told the country’s disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is assumed that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching a height of six meters have devastated Palu, where one will hold a massive funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is involved in a race to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the military present: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready for it?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says another man is missing, after it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger was missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane had been hit by water during the landing at the Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone’s condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what is the exact order of events remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane was shot down over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and a few others managed to get into it by wading through the water, which came to their aid, to the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he had a non-serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors who were nearing work at a shipyard had also helped with the rescue work by bringing people to the coast with an inflatable boat, before the plane sank further into the approximately 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have been killed in crashes by PNG-registered airlines over the past 20 years, but that none of this has anything to do with Air Niugini.
Analyst sets the timeline for the night a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisition on Friday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the phone call data to capture the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from various mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police started talking to Sanford again.
Sanford stood in the witness stand on Saturday and said he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck during that night, Sanford said he was "lied because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told her that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile phone data indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis knew the text messages, calls and contact details of his phone some time after Chambers' death.
"He knew her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense begins on Sunday with the closing arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to start the hearings later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hip hop'?
A hiphop trio wants to discuss the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol state that hip hop is alien to the origin of political opinions and the mapping of social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and make ‘conscious hip hop’ again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently had a revival in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York City children's jury sues a couple for 'racist' text
A New York City children's jury is challenging a couple to the court for dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a mistranslated text in which the mother had the complaint about "again such a black man."
The couple denies being a racist and calls the lawsuit “repression.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, showed her dismay when she discovered that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a black woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
'NEEEE WERE SO MUCH,' wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice no less than twice.
According to the U.S. newspaper The New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "uneasy", fired Mrs. Maurice when she realized her blunder, stating that their former child bride, who was African-American, had done a bad job, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice challenges the couple to court to get a compensation of $350.- per day for the 6 months she was hired to be a part of the family, though without a contract.
“I want to make them feel like you’re just not doing something like that,” Maurice told the New York Post last Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple disapprove of the claim that she is racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after they, by insulting her, were afraid that they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Get out of here."
Comparing the case to “pressing,” Plasco said his wife expected a baby in two months and was “in a very difficult situation.”
Are you going to persecute someone like that?
That's not so sympathetic," the investment banker added.
While the case is still going on, public opinion is quick to capitalize on the couple on social media, where they are hooked on their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking bear, reveals newly appeared letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s approval, said of the letter: “It’s hard to stand in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington’s enormous success, it’s very entertaining.”
She told her father, who, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, as a cameraman working at the British broadcaster BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was 'bitter-sweet' after its publication.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very prominent member of the family," she said her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
“But because Paddington was so lifelike to him, it almost seemed like a performance of a child; you’re proud while you’ve done nothing for yourself.
I think he was about the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he praised the bear for its success.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected that she would not get it," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then Nad’s phone call came to say that she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, 'Tashi, I love your treasure so much.
We'll be back together soon.
Then I'll be back with you.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were slowly worked out and left her body.
She had died for some time before that, and this process shut down everything.
I could just sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn’t complain, cry or cry because I was in the middle of all sorts of people and families.
I had to keep myself really big.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the death of her daughter, got on the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she had to undergo.
"Nobody knew," she said.
“I was sitting with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Rape women post messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost their loved ones by suicide are making themselves strong to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys post inspiring messages and phone numbers that people in need can call for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis was 13 years old when he first became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, Gloucestershire, England, says her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.
“He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile lit up every room.”
Yet he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the pit.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself of life.
Mrs Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's a chain reaction coming."
Mrs. Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and where you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don’t keep quiet – talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he was feeling gloomy or depressed or something,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was completely on the ground on Christmas Day - when the kids packed their presents, he didn't look at them at all or anything."
She said his death was a big trauma for her, but that they had to deal with it: 'It's tearing the whole family apart.
It drives us apart.
But we all have to keep going and keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain as FBI investigation begins
"I thought that if we could indeed get together what he asked for; an investigation limited in time and scope, we might be able to create a little more unity again," Mr Flake said last Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee would be "slaping apart" from me.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to set up an investigation?
Their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
The midterm elections are already over five weeks, on November 6 and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their efforts to get their husband elected to the highest court in the country are seriously hampered.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and so his wife Ashley met, who the Bush was his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would give Vice President Mike Pence the opportunity to cast the determining vote to confirm Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors 'declined' under Kim
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, which cites data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, says there were 1,127 overflows last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park states that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human traffickers are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded in public.
The vast majority of North Korean runners are eventually offered the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can more easily cross over than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the smugglers to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often exposes them to violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still formally capable of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries held a meeting in Pyongyang, where talks were mainly held on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they broadly agreed to work towards the nuclear decommissioning of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of lack of progress in lifting U.S. sanctions since then.
“Without faith in U.S. action, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under those circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him incompetent to serve in the Supreme Court
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the U.S. Supreme Court's candidate judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysterically" and found him unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman behaved this way, they would call her ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes cried almost and was especially shy when he told about his family and his high school days.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him "gross and coordinated character murder", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she found that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he was unfit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats,” Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when asked if she would try to set up an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he were appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I can say this about it; if he doesn’t tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, then he’s not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he’s serving now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District of Columbia Court (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat that Kavanaugh would go against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade (the Affordable Health Care Act). Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh circumvented questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
“Don’t expect us to be cheering when a hysterical, prejudiced person is appointed to the Supreme Court,” Pelosi said.
Women just have to admit it.
It’s a fair tirade of months and years of uptight anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
“We’re going to cry when we get angry,” Steinem said to me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s weird, do you?”
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was somewhere in charge and who told me that she also went to cry when she got angry. She developed a method, in which she always went to cry when she got angry. To the one she was talking to, she said, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm upset.
I'm angry."
And then she just continued to cry.
I just thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are partially allowed as an expression of anger, because tears are essentially misunderstood.
One of my best-kept memories from an earlier job, in a men-dominated office, is when I had to cry terribly because I was extremely angry. An older woman, a young businesswoman who everyone was a little bit afraid of, grabbed me in my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad they got you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally meaning 'cat litter' or 'open areas') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs. Schroeder thought that there was no reason why she would not be able to herself.
“It wasn’t a deliberate decision,” she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already 7 other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'.
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was left with fundraising, and so she promised solemnly not to participate if she could not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she gave her speech announcing that she was not going to start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings – of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and to reach voters instead of having sex with them – and they resented it.
'You will have thought I had a nervous breakdown,' Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the media reacted to her.
“They will have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be beneficial for Beijing
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were overwhelming, and although the fight has not been fought for a long time, a gap between the two countries could, according to experts, be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, earlier this year gave the first warning by raising taxes on key Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was announced this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 billion) of goods; half of all goods coming from China come from the US.
Beijing has taken natural reprisals every time, most recently by increasing tariffs from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has promised to equalize the U.S. every time, and the world on a second-largest economy will probably not quickly blink.
In order for Washington to bow, requests must be approved, but publicly bowing to the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays smart, the trade war with the U.S., China could positively support in the longer term, because the mutual dependence of the two economies decreases.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions, allowing one of the two countries to enter an economic free fall, is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a national security researcher at the Center for a New American.
Syria 'ready' to allow refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the conditions in his country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists, and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are still about six million people in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the uprising.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National golf course southwest of Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn scored the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
American team star Phil Mickelson, who was struggling almost the entire tournament, dropped his long stroke from the tee in the water at par 3, hole 16, and conceded his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever won 5-0-0 since the tournament in its current form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the lowest scorer of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, playing 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Segrio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t cry so fast, but today I can’t do anything about it.
It has been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he selected me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It’s about the team, and I’m glad I could help,” said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The tremendous pride I feel because I beat Tiger Woods, I kept following that guy when I was growing up," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic from one of the greatest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
The U.S. leader, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
In a short time this morning, we made Europe a little more difficult.
We opposed it.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their leader.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
Red glow update: Concentrations take off in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Florida Commission for the Conservation of Fish and Fauna) shows a general decline in concentrations of Red Fire in parts of the Tampa Bay Area (located on the west coast of Florida in the U.S.).
According to the commission, there is a report of a fragmentary increase in the Red Fire in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The Red glow extends over an average of 200 km of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
There are about 16 km off the coast of Hillsborough County spots to be seen, but in fewer places than last week.
Red glow is also seen in Pasco County.
Average concentrations have been reported for the coast of Pinellas County in the past week, low to high concentrations for the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations at or near the coast of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations at the bottom, and background to high concentrations in Charlotte County.
Irritation of the airways in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier is continuously reported.
In northwestern Florida, no reports of airway irritation have been reported in the past week.
