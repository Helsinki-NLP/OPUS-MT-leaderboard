Unfortunately, her hair was wet.
"I care very much about you," she admitted.
Please pour the flowers.
The deposit has been paid.
He was staring at her.
Put it under the cornice.
She fell in love with a Russian immigrant.
Did you fall in love with her at first sight?
To fall in love is one thing, to marry someone is another.
I aimed the gun at the target.
She locked herself in his bedroom.
Did I lock the main entrance?
I thought I'd get the job done by this time.
Leave him lying.
I'm not worth anything to you.
You paid more than you had.
You paid more than you had.
I paid with a credit card.
You paid more than you had.
I'll pay for Tom's ticket.
Will Tom pay for it?
Please turn on the radio.
Please turn on the radio.
Please turn on the TV.
It would be dangerous to involve Tom in this.
I forgot to tell you about Tom.
Have you forgotten everything we've done for you?
Forget it, it's not worth it.
Forget about this sad event.
Forget I said that.
You forgot to invite Tom, didn't you?
He forgot her name.
I forgot to paste the mark on the envelope.
I forgot all about it.
I forgot to ask for a bill.
I forgot my pen at home.
I forgot my wallet on the bedside table.
I forgot my password.
I forgot to pick Tom up from the airport.
I forgot that Tom can read French.
I forgot to delete it.

He forgot to return the keys.
He would sell his soul to the devil.
First I am without a crown, secondly I have no time.
Did I write it all down correctly?

We'll see Tom again.
I heard someone talking.
I deserve good things.
I deserve to know the truth.

He was shot because of an unhappy love.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot him.
I'll shoot you both.
They dragged her to the store and raped her.
While I was reading, the phone rang.
While Tom was still asleep, Mary was already awake.
You can be with me by now.
You're not interrupting anything yet.
Did the police arrest him?
You arrested Tom?
Close your fist.
That's not what I'm paying for.
I'm not paying for this.
That's what Tom's punishing you for.
I can't do it for Tom's trial.
You are not responsible for Tom's death.
The whole group was punished for Tom's mistakes.
That's why I love you.
I'm not paid for this.
In three months, Tom was dead.
I was paid five dollars for that bag.
She attacked him.
I'll call you back when I get to the bus stop.
I'll call you later.
I'll call you back a little later.
I'll call you back a little later.

Call me when you're ready to go.
Call her tomorrow.
Call me, will you?
Call me tomorrow.
Call your father and ask him.
Call him, please.
Call rescue! Call rescue!
They locked Tom in the cellar so he couldn't escape.
I closed the door so they wouldn't hear us.
I closed all six windows.
Close your book.
Please close the door when you leave.
Shut the fucking door!
You have to pay me for all my translations.
We sing another song.
I called the bell and waited.
We got rid of some old stuff.
Get rid of the evidence.
She loved him.
I love the ocean.
I love you.
The weapons industry brings profits, but also suffering.
We have the rest of the day for ourselves.
There's only one day left.
What is butter made from?
I don't completely agree that this is how I'm treated.
With all my heart, I hope he's happy.
She seemed to be locked up.
I felt like I was fighting in a war.
I felt like I was in love with a beautiful girl.
I felt like I changed my job.
I thought about the onion.
I thought I was a friend of a colleague from work.

It seems that Tom is being trusted by fewer and fewer people.
Tom seems to care if it happens or not.
Tom seems to be telling the truth.
Tom doesn't seem to remember any of us.
Tom seems to have fallen asleep.
Tom seems to have lost his sense of life.
He seems to know everything.
He seems to be neglecting his duties.
He seems to be losing motivation.
Here is a picture of my school.
Here you need to use the connector.
We left home early in the morning.
I can't wait to talk to her about this.
I can't wait to ask Tom for help.
A healthy relationship develops slowly.
Health is more important than wealth.
Health is the best gift.
She's holding her back from work.

Ask your mother.
It made the sound louder, so everyone heard it.
Raised a little radio.
He grew old, sneezed, and divorced, but also got rich and became famous.
He tried his best not to think of her anymore.
I didn't like him at first.
Clear it, please.
Fuck you!
Zhubla.

You disappointed Tom.
Who are you afraid of?
Check to see if you've forgotten anything.
Check it out, please.

You son of a bitch!
Experience brings wisdom.

For me, it's not excessive.
She disappeared in the dark.
He disappeared without a trace.
He disappeared into the crowd.
He disappeared from the surface of the earth.
Get out!
They screwed it up.
He knows them.
He knows them.
Knowledge of oneself is the beginning of all wisdom.
We've known Tom for years.
I know him, but I don't know his name.

They sing in the choir.
She sang a song, she smiled at me.
She didn't attract me from the beginning.
A cat came from under the desk.
Two boys came out of the room.
The news of Tom's death made me sad.
I've caused him a lot of trouble.
She betrayed me, I'm disappointed.
The mature apple fell from the tree.
I hurt myself.

The mirror is dimmed.
The mirror is broken.
They set up a new company in London.
I rarely see you and Tom.
I was just thinking about something.
I was just about to write a letter when he came home.
They ruined my life.
I'd cancel all the ducks if I could.
You canceled the meeting.
Cancel that advice.
Cancel the meeting.
She shook her face.
We can get a lot of valuable information from this book.
You've lost weight.
I wouldn't make fun of it.
Tom's a man now.

Stay home.
Will you stay or will you leave?
Will you stay or will you leave?
Stay where you are, or I'll kill you.
Stay with us!
Stay here and close the door.
Stay here!
Stay home and don't go anywhere.
Stay at home.
I'll stay with her.
I'll stay at the motel.
I'm staying with you.
Curiosity has won me over.
Raise your hands before you answer.
Get out of the chair and help!
We'll call you.
We'll do better.
Can you do it yourself?
Can you do it yourself?
Can you do it yourself?
I chose the path of least resistance.
He'll call me!
