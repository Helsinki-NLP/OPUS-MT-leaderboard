I'm worried they'll be "lookin' real"
Some ACau are concerned about a suggestion to change their titles in English to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Member of Parliament of Wales in Welsh).
This leads to the idea of changing the name of the building in the building.
Acau across the political spectrum is concerned that this could be a weak subject.
AC Labour said its group was concerned that the title was "wrong with the words Twp and Pwp."
And to anyone who understands the Welsh language: You don't want to be called that way.
ACC of Plaid Cymru said that the group was overall "unhappy" with the proposal and that they had offered other options.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was keeping an "open mind" about the name change, but it was suggested that there was not much difference between MWP and "Muppet".
The ASC's translation does not cause so much trouble.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change in name, said: "Of course, a matter for the members themselves will be the final decision on any descriptions of the Assembly Members' titles."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the power to the National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals. It was found that there was broad support for calling the assembly in the Welsh Senate.
In terms of the Assembly Members' title, the Commission favoured Members of Parliament of Wales (ASC) / Welsh Parliament Members (WMP), but MWP came out stronger in the public consultation.
According to the statement, ACau suggests other options, but the work of coming to a consensus could lead to the resignation of the President, Elin Jones. She is expected to introduce draft legislation on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the amendments will include other changes to the way in which the plan works, including rules on the non-application of ACau and the design of the committee's system.
The ACA will have the final vote on what they should be called when they discuss the legislation.
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday as to whether the country's name should be changed to "North Macedonia."
This popular vote was drawn in an effort to resolve a dispute that has lasted decades with Greece, a neighboring country that has its own province of Macedonia named after it.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right to its territory. It has opposed the country's requests to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia, opposes the country's vote on a name change and has said he will disregard the vote.
However, those in favour of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that a name change is the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Visits to Churches in Harlem Face Problems
"Historically, there was a bar and church on every corner, according to the old people I spoke to," Mr Adams said.
Today, there is one of them."
He said he could understand why the bars had disappeared.
"People are socializing in a different way today," he said.
"Right now, bars are not considered in community living rooms where people go on a regular basis."
As for churches, it is worrying that the money raised by selling assets will not last long as the leaders expect it to, "and long after, they will be back in the same old situation."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by flats with condominiums full of the kind of people who won't help the rest of the area's sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "which will mean that all of these churches will close early because it is unlikely that most of the people who move to this condominium will come from here."
The two churches were built by a white congregation before Harlem became a black petropolis - the Fetropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved away from there in the 1930s.
There was a black congregation that had been praying nearby owned by the building.
St. Martin's Church was handed over to a black congregation under John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the rectors on 125th Street, one of the main streets for shopping in Harlem, which refused to employ or raise black people.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's bluffs made plans for reconstruction, the keys were commissioned.
The Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and a nun at St. Martin's Church, was proud to give them the name "the ears of the poor."
The expert who was singing the keys in July gave them another name: "Cultural treasure" and "a unique historical tool."
Also, the expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, noted that these were the first ears in the world to be sung by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, and moved to sing the more ears at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that no one in St. Martin's church was in his place.
What has happened at St. Martin's Church in recent months has been a complex history of parishioners and contractors, some of whom have been employed by church lay leaders, and others by the Bishopric.
The feast - the governing body of the feast which contains false leaders - wrote to the diocese in July to indicate concerns that the diocese would "try to transfer the costs" to the feast, although the feast had not been closed and the feast had been closed permanently.
There were some who complained that there was a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was injured when he was on his way to California to search for twins.
According to official workers, a raid on a 13-year-old boy was carried out and injured on Saturday while he was on the run to search for bugs in California, on the first day of the season of the bugs.
The attack occurred just before 7am near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been floating with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy crying for help. Then, he contacted him with a group to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said he believed he was excited by the boy's grip to begin with. But, after reaching the boy, Hammel told him "to realize that he was crying, 'I've been beaten!
I've got my back!"
The bridge of his shoulder had been torn open."
I told everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a snake in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was lifted from the water in a helicopter and transported to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently in a serious condition.
We don't know what kind of attack was responsible for the attack.
In brief to the media, the life-saver, Captain Larry Giles, said that sarcasm had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous species of sarcasm.
Giles said that the victim had suffered injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Ecinitas. This was done for 48 hours for security and research purposes.
Giles said that more than 135 species of sharks in the area but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to reach the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by offering beauty copies in the form of department stores that include specialist assistants.
As part of the effort to reach the UK beauty market, a <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn market that is still growing despite the decline in fashion and home goods sales, the more beauty copies of this will be processed in 11 shops across the country.
This investment comes in the world of beauty as supermarkets search for ways to use empty shelves after being chased for TV sets, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double the number of its beauty products by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezeman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Goods from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space and the branded areas will be similar to those you'd see in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also re-launches its Boutique collection so that most of the product is suitable for bakers - something that's more and more called for among young shoppers.
The fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will also be processing concessions in two of Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon in south London last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
The fact that people shop online and move towards buying a little bit of food every day in local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the outlets will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain seeks to compete with the Aldi and Lidl discounters, offering more services and goods without being food.
Sainsbury's has been giving Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since she bought the two chains two years ago. He says that has strengthened food sales and ensured that shopping is more profitable.
He couldn't make a previous effort to reshape his beauty and ferocity sections.
Sainsbury's offered a joint venture with Boots in the early years of this century, but the partnership came to an end following a fraught with how to divide the refinery's shops in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's, three years ago, sold its pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain. The business included 281 stores that were sold for <0xC2><0xA3>125m.
Lloyds said it would be part of the scheme as it would add an extended range of luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's business director, said: "We have completely changed the way we pray and feel our beauty seasons are in order to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in co-workers who have been specially trained and will be there to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an essential beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones has reportedly taken Holly Willoughby out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal.
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, was a shocker after television presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business, in order to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand of accessories and goods to home.
The couple's business has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
Willoughby, one of the presenters of this morning, had posted a message on Instagram announcing she was leaving.
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, has a crush on Holly Willoughby to pull out of their business brand way of proficient living at the last minute - to focus on his own big new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was a "crazy" on Tuesday when the presenter admitted at a meeting at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant that she had not had enough money to pay for them.
The business had been compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow and said it doubled Willoughby's fortune, an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones traveled from Britain to one of her holiday homes.
The source said: "It was really one of Holly's top priorities.
That was her future in the long run and the work she would have done over the next few decades.
Everyone was surprised to hear that she had decided to leave.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, and they were so close to the launch.
There's a whole bunch of stuff in the headquarters in Marlow, and they're ready to be sold."
Experts believe that this decision by one of the UK's most established stars could cost the company millions due to a large investment in a product, including headphones, candles, clothing and household goods. This could also be a sign of a delay
This may also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby Truly established with Capp in 2016 and joined Jones, 52, as chairman in March.
The couples go on holidays together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity presenter on ITV.
One day, a source who is friends with Jones said, "We didn't pay any attention to his business matters."
It was hard, of course, and then we fell in love.
He made fun of the jury's verdict that would be received by the news media for making a "unprecedented" remark, according to some, and for being so positive when talking about the leader of North Korea.
"Why did President Trump take so long?
Trump said in a press release.
"I didn't say anything."
Kim said he wanted a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, a meeting that Trump described as a major step forward in North Korea's denuclearization.
However, the discussions on the deliberation have slowed down.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, one of North Korea's top diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, North Korea's top diplomats don't believe that North Korea's
Instead, he said that the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump was a lot more vocal in his big speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results - making the most of testing rockets, helping to free the hostages and ensuring that the rest of the U.S. military is returning home.
He tried to justify his unusual way of acting in terms of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be a leader, but instead of getting 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this full arena, we'd have about 200 people standing here," Trump said, pointing to the village ahead of him.
Indonesia's Tsunami and Earthquake Destroyed Island, Killing Hundreds
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population has been depopulated, a national disaster has not been declared, something that is necessary to curb international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is quite challenging," Ms. Sumbang said.
Although Saved the Children creates a team to travel to Paula, they are not yet sure if foreign staff can work on the land.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national agency for disasters, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be given assistance.
Because the earth is constantly falling in Indonesia, the country is never ready enough for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other beaches.
It seems that no one has been warned of the tsunami in Palu, although a warning has been given, and that has contributed to the number of deaths.
It is difficult to travel between the numerous islands of Indonesia at its best.
Natural disasters mean that the logistics are even more complex. . . .
A hospital ship that had been docked in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has focused on improving Indonesia's rationale for its electoral campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of money has been a blow to Mr. Joko's administration as he faces reelection next year.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from notable long-term tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken on a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been dethroned from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fight on the streets, using machetes, spears and shotguns, as well as other indiscriminate weapons.

"I saw Kante come and kick the ball without thinking too much about it, just go for it."
Half-time, Chelsea won 1-0 after Eden Hazard, the star of Belgium, scored in the 25th minute.

Cromwell's statue outside the Senedd is the latest memorial to be part of the 'history' retelling
Getting rid of the statue would be a barbaric justice for the violent destruction that has caused many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, a destruction committed by its fanatical Piwritanist followers.
But the Cromwell Society said Mr Crick's suggestion was one of "truths" that "try to rewamp history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inconceivable, in the current discussion about getting rid of cartoons, that figure Oliver Cromell outside St. Stephen's Palace would be targeted.
Cromwell was not responsible for carrying out or ordering the economization of England's civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
An excellent portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century judgment and is part of a figurative history that many people believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "A number of people, more in the 19th century than today possible, consider Cromwell to be a figure who defended the senate from external pressure, namely the kingdom in his case.
I don't know if that's true or not and that's a constant historical debate.
What is certain is that the revolution in the middle of the 17th century has led to the development of our country since then and Cromwell is an individual well-known figure representing one side of the debate.
His achievements as a Lord of the Rings are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Reibus monkey kills a farmer from China
He attacked a farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China, according to reports by local media.
South China Morning Post said on Sunday that a man, who was identified as ‘Yuan’, was found dead near a small crowd in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou state. His artery had been broken and blood was on it.
A small-scale farmer was preparing to spray vaccines on a small farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to him, he had travelled with his family from nearby Tunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 fewer in the market.
The next morning, his family came to find him dead and noticed that a neighboring cow's throat door was open.
He said there was a large man in the trunk and there was blood on his throat.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pound piggy bank had infected the farmer to death, according to the report.
"The legs of my hip had been torn and they were all bloody," said the hip, which was called after his nickname, "Wu", according to a statement in the Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera video showed Yuan reaching the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his calf.
His body was found about an hour later.
Neither Yuan nor his companion was the food of the animal that killed the man.
One of the market managers told the Evening News that the monkey had been locked up in order to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while the police were gathering evidence on the site.
According to the statement, Yuan's family and market authorities are discussing the death penalty.
Although there are not many of them, there are other records of cases where a monkey has attacked people.
In 2016, a monkey attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years later, a 650-pound farmer from Wales held onto his tractor until his wife scared the animal away from him.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his uncle in 2012, one of the Manitoba farmers told CBC News that a cow is not usually aggressive but that a blood taste can cause them to behave that way.
"They're being careful.
They're young, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You have to give them a lot of respect," he said.
The rest of Rosa's cormorant causes heavy rain over a vast area of south-west USA
According to forecasts, Corwynt Rosa is weakened as he moves over the cold waters of the west coast of Mexico.
However, the Rosa corundum will cause heavy rain across northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mya, Category 1 Corwynt, from 5am ahead of Eastern time on Sunday. The corwynt had 385 miles to the southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a pond begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and it moves eastward to the US West Coast. As Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, the crown will begin to turn atop a hill.
Rosa will carry up to 10 inches of hand to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the circular radius will rework with the support that is approaching causing heavy rain over the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 1 and 4 inches of hand will cause dangerous large floods, a flood of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical droughts will cause rainfall rates between 2 and 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected as much as between 2 and 4 inches of hand in parts of the southeast, especially over much of Arizona.
It is possible that large floods with the conditions will worsen rapidly due to the pressured nature of the periodic rain.
It would be very difficult to get out of the desert on foot with a threat of a circular hand.
Heavy rain could cause the countess to become wild rivers and a storm of thunder and thunderstorms will cause strong winds and thunderstorms in the area.
The nearby reef will cause some heavy local hands in parts of the coast of Southern California.
It is possible that a total of more than half a inch of hand will fall, which could cause a small flow of debris and slippery roads.
This would be the area's first flooding during its peak season.
A few scattered roundabouts will begin arriving in Arizona late on Sunday night and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads more late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
The temperature will change tremendously throughout the U.S. during October as the Arctic cools down, but the storms will still be quite mild.
This sometimes leads to significant changes in the temperature over short distances.
This is a great example of dramatic changes in temperature throughout the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
There is almost 20 degrees difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, what remains of the summer's beauty will try to rise and expand again.
A large portion of central and eastern U.S. is expected to get a warm start to October with the temperature in the 80s from the Southern Deserts to parts of the Northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show a high chance of temperatures higher than the average for the east of the U.S. throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people are listening to Brett Kavanaugh.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee for the Best Actress, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of sexually abusing her in the 1980s, giving evidence, on six separate television networks.
In the meantime, the political disagreement continued, with broadcasters disregarding the usual programs to broadcast the unexpected time Friday was found: an agreement drawn up by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, noting that the FBI will conduct an investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had touched on her inadvertently and tried to remove her clothes in a party at the high school, and that she had lied.
Kavanaugh said in giving his testimony that he was absolutely sure that didn't happen.
More than 20.4 million people are likely to have watched it on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company had an average audience count on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available directly for other networks that were showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And usually Nielsen has some problem measuring people who are watching in offices.
To give a perspective, the size of this audience was similar to a audience that would watch a football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, the channel's opinion guests have given strong support to appoint Kavanaugh, who led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which was on standby throughout the day.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 viewers, NBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
There was a lot of interest in listening as well.
Flake was the most prominent figure in the drama on Friday.
After Kavanaugh's office said he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was arrested on Friday morning on CNN and CBS with protesters shouting at him as he tried to get into a lift to hear the House Committee on Justice.
He stood looking down at the floor for a few minutes as he got his head blown, living on the television on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He said, "You have the power, and there are many women who are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement saying, before the lift closed, that he would have more to say after the committee's hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks were all filming live hours later, when it was time for the Judiciary Committee to vote to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination and get a vote in the full Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigates the allegations against the nominee by the following week, a result that the low-level Democrats have been encouraging.
Flake was partially criticized after a conversation with his friend, the Democratic Senator, Chris Coons.
Following a conversation with Coons and many other senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was one powerful one, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK May accuses judges of ‘playing politics’ in Brexit case <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In an interview with the new newspaper The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who condemned her plans to leave the European Union by saying they were "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining the interests of nations.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the new paper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, condemned what she called the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying she was "a ridiculously ridiculous" offer.
Wayde Sims shooting case: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of killing one of LSU players
Police have arrested a man on suspicion of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old football player in LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and will go to prison on suspicion of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released a video of the clashes between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims has lost his spectol during the fact.
The police found the spectol on the site and said they had found Simpson's DNA on it, CBS is receiving WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he had admitted to shooting Wayde and killing him.
He has a $350,000 fund, the publisher said.
The East Baton Rouge County Sheriff's Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the worst I know to the end is the cause of the death.
The department praises the task of the Louisiana State Police fugitives, the state's police crime lab, the South University police and the area's citizens for helping in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked the team for enforcing the area's law for its "stupidity and work to ensure justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-and-six-inch leader was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a football player for LSU.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 goals in the last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU football coach Will Wade said the team had "broken their hearts" and that they were "feared" after hearing about Wayde's death.
That's the kind of thing you worry about all the time.
Firefighters take over the city of Mexico City
Loads of explosives from the Popocatepetl mine have reached the southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention had warned Mexicans on Saturday not to go close to the volcano after the activity increased in the quake and 183 gas and cargo emissions were recorded over 24 hours.
The center was monitoring a number of pitfalls and pitfalls.
Images on social media showed thin layers of mud covering the front windows of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geo officers have noticed an increase in the volcano's activity, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) to the southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico's central region in September 2017.
The volcano is called "Don Goyo" and has been alive since 1994.
Police have been protesting against Catalan refugees for a year since the vote on independence.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after two independence protestors opposed the anti-corruption police and as thousands joined competitive protests to mark a year since Catalonia's run-off vote on protests.
A group of people in drugs who were in favour of resisting the anti-corruption police who held them back with eggs and powdered pancakes, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
There were also protests later in the day, with the police using their batons to control the fighting.
Over the course of several hours, independent groups chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive" and uninitiated protesters chanted "There's life in Spain."
14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, according to the local press.
Tensions are still high in this area that has its time for independence, a year after the October 1 referendum which Madrid considered illegal but which was celebrated by Catalans who are evacuees.
The majority of voters chose to become independent, but a lot of people did not come to vote and those who opposed voting had boycotted the vote significantly.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in polling stations across the region in appalling protests.
There were groups of independence parties in Friday night's camp to prevent opposition on the part of the national police.
The protest went ahead of him, but he was forced to follow another lead.
According to Narcis Termes, the 68-year-old electrician who was going to protest the rebels with his wife, was no longer a fugitive about gaining independence from Catalonia.
"Last year, we had one of the best times ever.
I've seen my parents cry out for joy in being able to vote but we're back in the same old situation now," he said.
Although they managed to win a small but crucial victory in the regional elections in December last year, groups that have gained independence have found it difficult to keep up the momentum to go this year and many of their most famous leaders have either survived or survived.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on her phone to support the police, the politicians on both sides had been producing the waters during the protest.
The feeling of dissatisfaction is increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Standing up as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the return in democratic values and the corruption we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after being driven into a house by a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was driven several times into a house in Londonderry.
This happened in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that a crossbow was shot at the car's head.
Menga's campaign secures a 1-0 victory for Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston to secure a victory for Livingston
Livingston surprised the Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard to lose for the first time in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack was the difference as Gary Holt's team climbed to the Hibernian level in a second.
Gerrard's team has not won a game from home in the Premier League this season and they face Hearts next Saturday, which is at the top and eight points ahead of them.
Earlier, the Rangers will be holding a game against Rapid Vienna at the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston has played six consecutive games in the division, and the head coach, Holt, has not lost a game since he traded Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is losing its chances against visitors.
Holt's team should have been at the forefront long before they scored and their direct nature was causing all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to cut a hole but eased his effort across the hole's face, then Alan Lithgow could not but aim his effort wide after slipping to meet Craig Halkett's penis across the hole,
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play ahead of them, knowing that they could cause problems for others in certain places.
And that's how the big picture was taken.
The Rangers won a free-kick that Livingston worked on to secure an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson working together to help Menga, who kicked the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
By then, the Rangers controlled possession of the ball but were unable to break through the home team's defenders and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was not much worried about sex.
This pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced an experiment by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was rejected at the foot of Allan McGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, and Lithgow kicked the ball wide from Livingston's other play set.
Guests were coming to Livingston's pockets continuously and they were kept clean, and were given two rights to a penalty kick - after Halkett challenged the late player, Glenn Middleton, and one for a handball - to disqualify them.
“An amazing performance” by Livingston –
Alasdair Lamont, one of the BBC Scotland analysts at Arena Tony Macaroni
An amazing performance and result for Livingston.
They were great and they continue to raise the expectations on this path that's coming up.
Their playing style and staff have not changed much since they reached the top, but Holt must be commended for the way he has pushed the team since he arrived.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, arranging a highly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their feet throughout the game.
But the Rangers didn't have a lot of spirit.
Although they played well at times under Gerrard's control, these standards were not to be seen.
They had a lot to do with their last ball - only once they opened the home side - and it was a bit of a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Welcome to Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne
She was a cheerleader and everyone was whistling on Saturday (Medi 29) as Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – a visit to try to improve ties between NATO allies.
They have disagreed over issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police had given security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough supporters had come near the mosque to see their leader.
Hundreds of protesters who were against Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an – many of whom were Jews – made sure their voices were heard, condemning Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome them to the country.
The protests of this municipality reflect the link that is associated with the visitor, a man who is considered a hero by some German Turks and is considered an autocrat by others.
Car crash in Deptford: A biker dies in a car accident
A man has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics came, but the man died on the spot.
The crash took place a few months after another witness died in a ‘shoot and run’ crash on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and to inform him of his closest relationship.
Road closure arrangements and directions have been put in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers have been wounded in prison
Six officers have been injured in a high-security men's prison, according to the Prison Office.
The incident took place at His Majesty Long Lartin Prison around 09:30 BST on Sunday and the case continues.
Special "Tornado" officers have been called there to deal with the massacre, which includes eight prisoners and which takes place in one breath only.
There were a number of injuries sustained by officers on their faces on the ground.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "Prison staff with special training have gone there to deal with this event that continues at Her Majesty Long Lartin Prison.
Six members of the staff have been treated for injuries.
We don't have a burden in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and that they can spend more time in prison."
His Majesty's Prison Long Lartin contains more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was said that the governor of the prison had been treated in the hospital after one of the prisoners attacked him.
And in October last year, anti-corruption officials were called to the prison to deal with a serious incident where the staff were attacked by a policeman.
Rosa's Corwynt is a large floating bay in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (Can Dry Elwa Areas)
Regional low pressure is rare in Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week as the rest of the Rosa Corwynt travel across the Southwest of the Wilderness, causing a risk of major flooding.
The National Weather Service has already announced that it will keep an eye out for major flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into the south and east of Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Laffsta.
Rosa is expected to follow a direct route across Phoenix on Tuesday, turning her hand late Monday night.
In a post on Twitter, the National Weather Service in Phoenix said that only "ten tropical cyclones that have maintained low storm or pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a milestone within 40 miles to the borders of AZ."
The most recent models of the National Center on the West are projected between 2 and 4 inches by hand, with a small example of a total of up to 6 inches on the Mogollon Arizona Range.
Other areas in the Southwest of the Bay include the Great Basin and the middle Rockies are likely to be between 1 and 2 inches, with a single case of a total of up to 4 inches possible.
For those who are not at risk of major flooding, Rosa's rain can be beneficial for them as they live in a dry area.
Although floods are a very serious concern, it is likely that some of this rain will be beneficial because of dry conditions in the Southwest at the moment.
According to the U.S. Safety Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought at least, the highest category is just one," weather.com said.
To begin with, the Rosa Trail will lead to land along the Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, who was so strong with a Sunday morning dew with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving northwards by traveling 12 miles per hour.
The storm reaches the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean so it weakens.
Because of this, the horn is expected to reach the land in Mexico on the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or on Monday night.
The rain could be heavy over parts of Mexico, causing a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of hand from Baja California is expected to enter northwest Sonora, with a probability of up to 10 inches," according to weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early in the morning as a low-pressure storm, which will then travel up through Arizona and right Utah arriving late in March.
"The main danger that is to be expected due to Rosa or the remnants of the crown is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and southwest U.S. desert," the National Center for the Americas said.
This rain is expected to create large, life-threatening floods as well as a flood of debris in the desert and landslides on mountainous land.
Norton Midsomer Attack: Four arrested for attempting to kill <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Three boys in their thirties and one 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found to have been stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, which is around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital and continues to be there in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
The officials have asked anyone who has material on their mobile phone about what happened to the submission of that evidence.
Trump says Kavanaugh has ‘suffering from the relapse and dictatorship’ of the Democratic Party
"I voted for Judge Kavanaugh as a vote to deal with the Democratic Party's disgruntled and shameful tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffering from the resurgence and dictatorship" of the Democratic Party throughout its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and was embroiled in the conviction of Christine Blasey Ford who claims she was sexually abused decades ago, and both in their thirties.
Ford also testified in the hearing about his claim.
The President said on Saturday that "the people of America have seen the beauty and standard and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"I voted to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal workers of our lifetime, a lawyer with an excellent history of public service," he told the crowd of supporters in North Virginia.
The President made an unbiased reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of the Republican assembly in the mid-term elections.
"It's going to be one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not asking for it, but I'm asking for it," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere to try to fight for great candidates."
Trump said the Democrats' mission is to "resist and block."
The first key operational vote is expected at the bottom of the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination taking place on Friday at the latest, the senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds have been killed by Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the number is increasing.
At least 384 people have been killed, many of whom have been displaced as huge domes have been cut off on the beaches, after a major earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday when waves as high as six meters hit the beach late at night, evacuating many from there and killing them and destroying anything along the way.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the warning was received about the tsunami yesterday, people were carrying on with their activities on the beach, they didn't run away from it immediately and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's whistleblower agency, said in a statement.
The tsunami was not on its own, it was dragging cars, bonks, houses, it was hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open sea at a rate of 800 cya (497 mia) before hitting the beach.
Some people have tried to cut down trees to avoid the tsunami and survive.
About 16,700 people were moved to 24 centres in Pau.
Photographs from the air published by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops had been damaged, a bridge had fallen and a mosque was surrounded by water.
The storms were still raging in the coastal city on Saturday night.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area that included 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT) said that the energy released by a massive Friday earthquake was about 200 times more than the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The city's geography, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have predicted the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as one "heavy" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The body of some of the victims was found trapped under a rubble of buildings that had fallen, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the damage and the number of people injured could be more along the 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggata, which is closer to the tip of the earth.
“There was no way to communicate with Donggala to get information,” Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,00 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is a disaster, but the situation could worsen," he said.
The agency was convicted on Saturday of failing to disclose that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials say the waves had arrived at the time the warning was published.
In an amateur film shared on social media, a man on a high floor can be heard shouting at people in the street below warning them that a tsunami is on his way.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the ground, carrying buildings and stones from there.
Reuters couldn't get the film straight away.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that wiped out the communications around Palu making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but there is a real need for food and other necessities on those who have had to leave their homes.
The city's airfield has been re-opened only for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was about to go to the rescue centers in Palu on Sunday.
More than 800 people have died in the Indonesian tsunami.
It's a terrible situation.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the workers are trapped in tunnel shelters that have been installed in the yard of their office, they've done a stopover on the road, said Mr. Doseba.
"They said they had seen a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
Things are very bad.
Even as aid groups go so far as to begin the documentary process of providing emergency aid, some have complained that special foreign aid workers have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies or staff cannot be provided unless the site of the disaster has been declared as a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the state level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government says, 'Yes, this is a national disaster,' we can get international support, but there is no status yet."
As she spent the night in Palu for the second time following the earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of those who are still missing hoped that their fans would live through some miracle, which would radiate some of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled from a coffin.
On Sunday, rescuers managed to free a woman who had been held under a blanket for two days with her mother's body near her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia's national paragliding team coach, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which was held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi said that his disciples were among the others who drowned at the Roa Roa hotel.
"As someone with experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional little self," he said.
During the hours after the paragliding community heard about the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, Mr. Gendon said he had sent a lot of WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
But there was only one tic that was close to his messages, rather than two blue dikes.
"I think that means that the messages have not been sent," he said.
The theft cost $26,750 as the ATM machine is reloaded in Newport on the Levee.
On Friday, robberies cost $26,750 by one of Brink's employees who was refueling an ATM machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release by the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been driving an ATM machine in the entertainment building, preparing to provide more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
When he was busy, another man "runs behind the Brink employee" and carries a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Many witnesses saw other people fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number that was part of the incident.
Anyone with information about who these people are should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West is changing his name – to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one who is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been called Ye and used the name as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before he appears on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He goes on the show instead of Ariana Grande, the singer from America who pulled back because of "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word that is most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'to me'," West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of his album with Big Boy, who presents it on the radio.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
The name Kanye, which means the only one, went to Ye alone – reflecting the good, the bad and the evil, everything.
The album does more than reflect who we are."
There are a number of other famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has been given various names such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he has the better names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to work with West, has also been using his name by varying it in terms of July and the seasons.
The U.S. military says it will not use military force against civilians in Mexico
Mexico's president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to use troops against citizens as the country celebrates 50 years since the bloodshed against students.
On Sunday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador pledged "never to use the army to defeat the people of Mexico."
Soldiers fled during a peaceful protest on the plaza on 2 October 1968, killing as many as 300 people, when left-wing student movements raged across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young people in Mexico by providing grants to those who study and open more public universities for free.
He said the lack of work and educational opportunities meant that young people were being drawn to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the money it spends on research in the field, said investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government make publications about artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have a formal artificial intelligence strategy in general.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year, which aims to be the best country in the context of every innovation by 2030.
"To ensure double the funding for research work in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are much less developed than the U.S., and we are looking for the next discovery in the field of understanding," he said.
The doubling of the budget could mean doubling the opportunity to ensure that the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence is being achieved in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee has published his book "Al Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month and is Chief Executive of Innovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that surpassed the best Othello player in America. He later became an active officer at Microsoft Research and president of the China branch of Google.
Lee recognized the U.S. government's previous technology competitions as Her Robotic Senior Research Projects Agency in the field of Defense, and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next viewers.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to earn grants from the government, Lee said.
"China doesn't take the academic leaders; it's the corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been trying to hire brilliant university students from universities to work on artificial ingenuity recently.
Lee also said that changes to the policy could help the U.S. to reinforce its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that green cards should be offered automatically to people with an understanding in artificial intelligence," he said.
China's State Council announced its next-generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017 to be launched in the country.
The National Institute of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Institute of Science and other government institutions provide funding to researchers from the U.S., but it's still empty.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established with the Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is to include partners from the industry and from the academic world, and the White House announced that a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence has been formed.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment in a concept called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in research work on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been in place for months.
Macedonia's citizens are voting in a referendum on a change in the country's economy
Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "North Macedonia", which would resolve a dispute that has lasted decades with Greece, which has prevented Macedonia from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a right to its territory and has prevented the country from becoming part of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments launched a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but national opponents argue that the change would underscore the identity of Macedonia's fabled Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a campaign to boycott has cast doubt on whether the number of voters will meet the target of 50 per cent needed to implement the referendum.
This is the question I voted in the referendum: "Do you want to become a member of NATO and the EU and accept the agreement with Greece?"
Those who are in favour of changing the name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying for Macedonia, one of the only countries to develop after the collapse of Yugoslavia, to have access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonian people so that they can live free under the shadow of the European Union because that ensures safer lives for all of us," Georgijevska, 79, said in Skopje.
Although they have not been legally bound, enough members of the parliament have said they will expect the outcome of the vote to make it a definite vote.
To change the name you would have to have a majority of two-thirds in the Senate.
The state's election commission said it was not talking about any disagreements by 1pm.
However, only 16 per cent voted, compared to the last parliamentary election in 2016, where 66 per cent of the voters who had registered to vote did so.
I have come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018, a change that would mean that the country could join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Senate in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and installing chairs in front of a lobby that had been installed by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are on the side of NATO and the EU, but we want to join by being able to hold our heads high, not through the door of the servants," Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we are poor.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that becoming a member of NATO will ensure the investment he really needs in Macedonia, a country whose unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
I think the vast majority will be in favour because there are more than 80 per cent of our citizens from the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said the "yes" result would be "confirming our future."
According to a vote set up last Monday by the Macedonian Foundation for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - which is less than the necessary number.
Another poll, conducted by Telma TV Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 per cent said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the number of voters must be 50 per cent and one vote.
If the referendum fails, that would be the first serious attack on the Western government's policy since it took the reins in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero, City of Manceinion, pass all Brighton defenders and get a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton defenders during a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look awfully easy as he scored in 65 minutes.
The driver of the bus was in the middle of the field at the beginning of the chase.
He ran through three Brighton defenders, before reaching the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green crosses.
One defender threw away before running earlier than many others on the edge of the Brighton boxing.
He then gave a bass to his left, giving the ball to Sterling.
The leader of England used his first touchdown in the box to put the ball back to Aguero, and used his right shoulder to play Brighton's goalkeeper, Matthew Ryan, with a jump to the right side of the net.
Aguero has some problems with his feet," Manceinion City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about how he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he had scored a goal at the time."
But Sterling gave Chelsea the first advantage in the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in the possession of Brighton at that time.
He gave a nice kick through the players along the back yard to Leroy Sane.
Sane walked the ball a few times before Sterling took him to the nearest post.
Chelsea's header kicked the ball into the net before rolling across the boundaries.
Manceinion City is playing against Hoffenheim in the Champions League playgroup at 12:55pm on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer to play against the Rockies
Since the Nationals have no hope of competing in the second-place games, there is not much reason for forcing another beginner.
But Scherzer hopes to stand on Sunday's rampage to face the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are prospects for a second-place game for the Rockies, which saves the Los Angeles Dodgers ahead of a single game in the NL West.
The Rockies secured a second chance with at least a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to secure their place in the first group.
"While we're not playing for anything, at least we can turn the wheel knowing that there will be a good atmosphere here with the town in Denver and that the other team will play at the highest level that we'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play a game like that?"
The Nationals have not announced a starter for Sunday yet, but according to the statement they are keen to let Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would start for the 34th time, was given a practice session on Thursday and would throw on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The right-hander who plays for Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 ‘strikeout' tackles in 220 2/3 of this season's batting.
Trump's presence in North Virginia
The President referred involuntarily to the situation concerning his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and then spoke of the importance of the Assembly of the Republic in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done is going to be done in the month of November.
Five weeks is going to be one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big ones – I don’t apply but I’m really applying, that’s why I travel everywhere fighting for great applicants,” he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see the horrible, horrible radical group here, you see this happening in this place.
And they're determined to take back the power by using any means necessary, you see the relapse, the damage.
They don't care who gets hurt, who they have to sacrifice to get power and control, they want to get power and control, we're not going to give that to them."
The Democrats, he said, are trying to "resist and stop."
"And we've seen that over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "sick and mean and unwelcome and ambitious."
He referred to the name of the high-ranking Democratic Senator, Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and heard a loud noise among the audience.
Do you remember his response?
You've shared the document?
Y, y, what.
No, no, wait a minute - that was an example of a poor body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
Work is no longer a good thing.
It's not the people who say what they're saying.
When members of Momentum's active members in my local constituency voted to vote for me, it was a big surprise.
After all, I'm the latest of many kinds of Workforces to hear that we're not welcome - and that's for saying we're not.
My parliamentary co-worker, Joan Ryan, has been pushed in a similar way for her to stand decisively against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the suggestion of a mistake was to judge me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Disagree with him about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe. Ironically, these are issues similar to those that Jeremy was disagreeing with previous leaders around them.
The announcement for the East Nottingham Labour meeting on Friday noted that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
During most of my eight years as the local Labour AS, the GC Friday night meetings have been meetings like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the case in most of today's meetings and we have long forgotten about the promise of a "more kind, more tender" policy, although that has never been found.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not guaranteed in the Labour Party and that all positions are judged on the basis of whether or not they are acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This started soon after Jeremy became a leader. Co-workers I used to think that they from the same political background as me started expecting me to do a full turn and support ideas that I would never have agreed to on such a move - or I would never have agreed to a ban on such a ban.
Whenever I speak in public - and there's no difference what I'm going to say in fact - it will lead to violent attacks on social media calling for my non-election, condemning the centre's politics, telling her to stay away from it.
And I'm not the only one who has experienced this.
In fact, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my co-workers because the comments that are handed down to them tend to be political ones.
I admire the professional and decisive nature of those co-workers who face a lot of sexual or sexual abuse every day but they don't let that get the best of them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of politics is the way in which levels of abuse have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of irresponsibility.
In fact, we are not such a promising party right now and with every offer of "lack of confidence" or a change to the rules of choice, the party becomes more silent.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years encouraging me to keep my head down, not to overstate my judgment, then I'll be "right."
That's not why I chose to be a politician.
I joined Llafur as a school pupil 32 years ago, having been confused by the exegesis of Thatcher's government, a government that was responsible for the torqualifying state of the classroom of my entire school. I have since tried to encourage them to leave
I've never been to the top of my list, nor have I ever been to the top of my list.
No one in the East of Nottingham would have been able to misunderstand my political views and the areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the proposal on Friday, all I have to say is that I don't understand the desire to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader with the country moving towards Brexit that will rise to poverty and poverty.
But, in fact, it's not a message to Momentum Nottingham that I have, but a message to my constituents, Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no number of threats from my non-election or political movement will interfere with your anger.
Chris Leslie is the president of East Nottingham.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr falls on the top
There may be two late applications that have somewhat turned on the final result, but it's certain that Ayr deserves to win this Tennt's Premier League game.
They're now at the top of the table, the only team that hasn't kicked them off the bench.
In the end, their excellent defensive work, as well as their work of taking advantage of opportunities, was responsible for maintaining the home team and the coach, Peter Murchie, had every right to be proud.
We've had challenging games so far, but no one has stolen us, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We have to thank Ayr, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did."
He applied for Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Climo, to ensure that Ayr was ahead. However, the yellow card received by the Scottish captain, Rory Hughes, which was released for the game by the Warriors, meant that Melrose's attempt to force him to place his hand over to his opponent, Melrose.
Climo made sure that Ayr never went ahead with a chic penalty, before he, before exactly half time, scored and processed a single application to secure a score of 17-5 for Ayr in the spring.
But Melrose started the second half well and made an application for Patrick Anderson, who was converted by Baggot, reducing the gap to five points.
Then there was a bit of waiting because the Knott Trail was seriously damaged, and was carried away on a stretcher. After they restarted, Ayr received more success following a request from Stafford McDowall, who was turned over by Climo.
Then, Ayr's temporary captain, Blair Macpherson, got a yellow card, and again, Melrose made the extra player pay with a case without being turned over by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of frenzied weight.
The home team came back to him, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for the Climo score without the ball, from the penalty kick, MacPherson gave the ball down to Ayr's increased charms.
Climo turned the application, as he did again almost immediately after a restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's pocket knife and sent the striker Gregor Henry away from the home team's fifth application.
Star Still Game is looking for a new career in the food industry
Ford Kieran, one of Still Game's stars, hopes to move to the hospitality industry after he discovers he has been named as the director of a licensed food company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, along with writing and acting alongside his comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth series on the horizon will be the final series in the show's history and it is likely that Kiernan is planning for his life after Craigland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment on the story, but one of the Scottish Sun sources suggested that Kiernan hopes to be part of Glasgow's "funny food store."
‘Do not drink the sea’: Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol the naval headquarters of a rigio clade in La Paz.
Public buildings sweep a forest banner like the sea.
Marine centres from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the signs: "Sea beer is not by right.
His recovery is a duty."
Bolivia is surrounded and the memory of the forlin that was lost to Chile in a bloodshed over resources in the 19th century is still alive - in the same way as the prospect of sailing the Pacific again.
These hopes are more pronounced than they have been for decades, as Bolivia waits for a verdict by the international justice court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia has a momentum, a sense of unity and calmness, and for this reason it is tempting to wait for the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
A number of Bolivian citizens will be watching the judgment of the international justice court on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in the Hague will decide on Bolivia's plea - after decades of heated discussions - that there should be an open debate.
Evo Morales, a charismatic Bolivian president - who faces a controversial fight for next year's re-election - relies heavily on Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court is not likely to decide on Bolivia's side - and many wouldn't change if the court did.
The body of the United Nations in the Netherlands has no power to adjudicate Chilean territory, and has indicated it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the verdict of the international justice court comes just six months after the final debates were heard suggests "that the case was not one complex," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean man who specializes in gay law.
And instead of improving the case of Bolivia, it is possible that the last four years have worsened the case.
"The current administration of Bolivia has ignored this issue, which concerns access to the sea," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales's warlord has stressed any good will that Chile had after, he suggested.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not changed their constitutions since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the process of making court decisions is usually a quick process.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an "extraordinary opportunity to begin a new period of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disunity over Chile's interests," he said.
Also, Calzadilla denied that Marales - who remains one of Latin America's most popular leaders - used the maritime issue as a political issue.
"Bolivia will never claim its right to access the Pacific," he added.
This is an opportunity for us to realize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says it will not get rid of its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would never get rid of its nuclear weapons unless the member first trusted in Washington.
Mr. Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to abide by the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy that would not be able to reach an agreement, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong-un.
Ri says that it is only a woman's dream that the continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to declare an end to the Korean War will make the North arm itself.
Washington is reluctant to agree with the statement before Pyongyang makes significant de-escalation moves in the first place.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are set to hold a second summit.
But there is a lot of doubt about whether Pyongyang is serious about arming the country, more than likely, which it considers to be the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Shows Reveals That The Latest Collection Of Huge Properties Is Coming To Your Great Street
If you want another hat or if you want to stop the sun altogether, this is the fashion for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a variety of huge and spectacular properties for their SS19 collection on the fashion stage, which was shining on the set of styles in the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unusual hats have appeared on Instagram this summer and the amazing creations of these designers have been seen on the fashion stage.
One of Valentino's most impressive items was a het het over the top of a patchwork decorated with a smooth edge covering the heads of the models.
Among the other great atolls, water melons were decorated with games, devin hats and even headbands - but these hats wouldn't warm your head.
Tom Browne also revealed a collection of strange threats - and that's in good time for Calan Winter.
Many of the coloring drugs of the lips had been sewn together and were more likely to Hannibal Lecter than to make a huge dent.
One of them looked like a sponge-blooming suit with snorkels and goggles, and the other looked like a coal cone, which had melted.
And, if you're enjoying great fashion statements - this is your chance.
Those who keep an eye on the style predict that huge boulders could reach your big street.
These big hats follow the style of ‘La Bomba’, the popular two-foot-long furry hats, which are even worn by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label had behind these unusual hats seen on other major social media creations on the fashion platform as well - a look bag almost as big as the model in a swimsuit that was wearing it.
The raffle bag, decorated with a raffle edge and white leather handle, was one of the most impressive items in the La Riviera SS19 Jacquemus collection in Paris Fashion Week.
Famed stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big beach hats and bags reach the big street next summer – as the designer has made so much of an impression, it would be difficult to avoid the call for big restorations.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens.
Independent schools in Scotland hold a good reputation for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams, which is only replicated by individual and joint success in the fields of sports, art, music and equestrian endeavors.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland (SCIS), are seeking to provide the best level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further education and higher education, for the careers they choose and for their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and operate a leading school curriculum, we see modern languages still being popular subjects that are chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to someone in a language he understands, that will stay in his memory.
If you talk to someone in their own language, it will stay in your heart."
This is a powerful message to remember that we can't rely on English only when trying to foster relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the results of this year's exams recently, we can see that languages are at the top of the tables and contain the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages have received a high A degree.
The data, collected from the 74 schools that are a member of SCIS, shows that 72 percent of pupils have received a High A degree in Mandarin, and that 72 percent of those who were studying German, 69 percent of those who were deaf and deaf were deaf.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Languages, such as subjects, are now treated in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curriculums and in other places.
A survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that a lack of linguistic skills was responsible for 17 percent of the reasons that employers were unable to fill vacancies.
Therefore, there is more to call for languages in order to prepare young people for their careers in the future.
With more opportunities for pre-arranged jobs requiring for languages, these skills are essential in a global environment.
No matter what career someone chooses, if that person has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future of having such a long-term skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people in other countries will mean that a bilingual person will step forward immediately.
According to a poll by YouGov that included more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 73 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language good enough to hold a conversation. Also, French was the only language that was spoken by a figure of 15 cents, respectively.
That's why investing in language learning is important for children today.
Being able to speak a number of languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will provide a better opportunity for children to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, every school will be different in terms of the languages they will be taught.
A number of schools will focus on classical modern languages, but other schools will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK as they look around 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages he can choose from in independent schools, and the schools will include teaching staff specializing in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what is ahead of them.
At present, in a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still essential to the country's future, so that must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as "skills of international communication."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, variety and prominence for young people of Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James start playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the opening game of the series before the start of the season on Sunday at the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he hasn't decided how many minutes he'll play again.
"It's going to be more than one but less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell said on Twitter that it is likely that James will play a few minutes.
After a practice session earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game season before the start of the season.
"At this point in my career, I don't need games before the season to prepare," he said.
West Virginia Trump Rally Time, YouTube Channel
President Trump is starting a series of rallying rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five races scheduled for next week, including visits and friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his choice for the delayed Supreme Court, Trump is seeking support for the midterm elections as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when the vote takes place in November.
When is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
Trump's rally is in Wheeling, West Virginia at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below using live feed on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearings about his nomination for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is under stress as a result of allegations of sexual misconduct with the vote to be confirmed in the delayed parliament for up to a week while attending the BBI.
But the main goal of the series of rallies is to help Republicans who face tough elections in November to win a bit of momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that the next five rallies over the week would aim to "bring out volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to defend and add to the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible before the start of the important campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not give his name, told Reuters.
Hosted at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, this evening's rally could bring back supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get attention from the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state that won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Virginia's West Virginia Republican Senator Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come here to try and give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team shows the pool to fight ahead as they go to individual games on Sunday
After three rounds of one-on-one sessions, Thursday afternoon could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum pendulum is a concept that has been conceived in the sports world but it is a concept that the players believe in especially in competitions like this.
So, where would they say that's the moment right now?
"They were ahead of six points and now it's four, so we have a little bit of momentum to know," Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points on the plane with another decade to play.
As Spieth said, the Americans feel that they have a little wind in their lungs and they have enough to warm them up, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas who played with each other throughout the day and got three points out of the four of them.
It's been a great experience for you, and it's a great example.
The cheerleaders went up as their round went ahead of him, succeeding with a vital pick to go on a four-on-four game despite being from Thomas having been down two after two.
There was a similar joke after the pick that the game won them on the 15th, the kind of joke that tells you that America doesn't think it's out of it yet.
"You have to focus and worry about your own game," Speith said.
That's the only thing these players have now.
18 inches to create an image.
The only players with more points than Speith and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unique story of the Ryder Cup.
They've got a couple of but loving Europe four for four and they can't do anything about it."
"Moliwood" was the only bar not to have a Saturday morning drink, and they didn't have a Saturday morning drink, Friday afternoon, or the last nine Friday mornings at a time.
That flight, and the way the energy is flowing between them and the town, confirms that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that the same player would be more popular to confirm Europe's victory as their right to a small Fleet National Golf course.
If both can be on the same price on different styles.
But it's too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson ran Sergio Garcia, a four-ball champion in the morning, easily when he got his bar with Alex Noren.
In the first nine, the Spaniard and the Swedes were in a hole that they did not come close to pulling out of.
But on Sundays, no one is going to help you out of your hole.
There are four pairs and the four that are interesting to watch because of the relationship between the players, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way the strategy can change in a second.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and they are leading a bit at the beginning of the last day, but the quarter-finals session has proven that the U.S. Team has the ability to fight, something that some especially in the U.S. were in doubt.
Europe ahead of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after finishing four games and four on Saturday 10-6 in front of the US.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the campaign with two wins over Tiger Woods to go and their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
European coach Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to regain the trophy after losing to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American bad team in four balls in the morning going 3-1 in the series.
The U.S. gave more opposition in the four quarters, but they could not get rid of the lack.
Jim Furyk's squad needs eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the score.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four points after each other and he and Molinari, who have been called "Moliwood" after an amazing weekend, are the second bar to get four of their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After Woods and Patrick Reed walked into the four balls they did a great job working together to train Woods on the American team Bryson Dechambeau from 5 and 4.
Wood, who himself played two games on Saturday, found some special opportunities but has lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and fours and sevens after each other.
Justin Rose, who has competed for the ball this morning, returned as a partner to Henrik Stenson in the fours and placed Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka first and third in the world of 2 and 1.
It wasn't all about Europe on a beautiful and auspicious day in the south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won three majors, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain in the four balls and later they won Polter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the fours after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of the Ryder Cup have the team come back from having four points behind the start of the individual games, although only an equal score is needed on Furyk's squad as they are the fans of the trophy.
But, after being second for two days, coming into their light on Sunday looks like it's beyond their ability.
North Korea says it won't be able to defend itself without confidence.
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister said that the United Nations is continuing to strengthen its sanctions against the United States and that the country will not be able to get rid of its nuclear weapons unharmed under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the international organization that North Korea has taken "significant good will actions" in the past year, in order to give the best of nuclear exercises and opportunities, to denuclearize and denuclearize the nuclear arsenal, to denuclearize the nuclear arsenal and to denuclearize the nuclear arsenal.
"But we don't see that kind of response from the U.S.," he said.
"Without confidence in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances we will not be able to attack ourselves first."
Although Ri has reiterated North Korea's well-known allegations of Washington's opposition to a gradual response to nuclear deterrence where North Korea will be rewarded by taking gradual steps, his statement was to be seen substantially as he did not deny the nuclear deterrence.
Ri referred to the joint statement between Kim John Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the current U.S. president and North Korea's sovereignty in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work towards the "nuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula" while at the same time
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. has said Pyongyang must put its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also denied calls for tough international sanctions to be imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. is pushing for 'dad-nullification first' and they are increasing the pressure through sanctions in order to reach their goal in a mandatory manner, and they even oppose the 'statement to end the war'," RI said.
"The belief that sanctions can overwhelm us is a dream by people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the sanctions continue to strengthen our evilness."
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a summit that the president had convened in the United Nations a week earlier.
Instead, the minister noted the three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the past five days and added: "If South Korea were the party to the issue of nuclear disarmament and not the U.S., it would not be a major concern.
Despite this, Ri's speech was very different last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that he was targeting the U.S. with North Korean rockets desperately after Trump called Kim a "rock man" on his own terms.
Last year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year was in the midst of the complete destruction of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to arm-arm, but said there was a lot of work to be done again and that the sanctions must be enforced.
On Wednesday, Trump said he doesn't have a specific period for this, saying "if it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia have discussed that the United Nations General Assembly should reward Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday: "The Security Council's sanctions must be strictly enforced and unsatisfactory until we realize and affirm our father-in-law.
The Security Council unilaterally increased the sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in order to try to limit the funding for Pyongyang's nuclear programs and missiles.
Ri met with Pompeo on the eve of the United Nations General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in order to prepare for a second conference.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go that way.
Pyongyang left in July saying there had been an increase, but North Korea was accused within hours of making "orders as a gangster."
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month in order to decipher the site of the sites and a nuclear site if the U.S. takes "equivalent games."
He said Kim had told him that the "matches" he was asking for were the security guarantees Trump had made in Singapore and moves towards normalizing the relationship with the United States.
Harvard students have a course on getting plenty of rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year is being taught by undergraduates to get more sleep in order to try to cope with the male culture of studying overnight using caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world's best universities are often indistinguishable when it comes to your after-school needs.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital who has designed the course, believes it is the first of its kind in the U.S.
He was inspired by the beginning of the course after giving a lecture on the effect of lack of sleep on learning.
‘At the end of the lecture a daughter came to them and said: ‘Why am I only now learning this, in my last year?’
He said no one had said anything about the importance of sleep - it was surprising to me," he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is being presented for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep practices help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health services, said the university has decided to introduce the course after discovering that students are suffering from a serious lack of sleep.
The course continues to include a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a living room, where students click on layers of coffee, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how a lack of sleep affects athletic performance, and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We are aware that it will not change the behavior of the students directly.
But we believe that they have the right to know - in the same way that you have the right to know what the impact of smoking on your health is," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of being proud to stay up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing emphasis on students means that lack of sleep is a problem that is getting worse,
You should ensure that you get enough sleep, and that of quality, to be a way for students to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight ahead, since lack of sleep makes your brain think you're doing it.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from Galifornia who studies chemical and physical life, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after studying one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to try to get the course for the entire campus.
It is hoped that the next step will be to require each graduate student to complete a similar study plan before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider setting an alarm to go to sleep, together and to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue light' that are released by electronic screens and LED light, which can affect your ability to shine.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal against Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another bad game from home as Dolly Menga's goal led to a 1-0 loss to Steven Gerrard's left-back team in Livingstone.
Ibrox's team had been looking for their first win on the road since they beat St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt Gerrard's team only ran for the second time in 18 games as a manager to leave the team eight points behind as the lead coach.
Menga scored seven minutes before half time and the Rangers team was short of inspiration and no sight of being able to get even.
While Rangers are now dropping to sixth place, Livingstone is rising to third just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for Rangers after the player Calum Spence had to be treated to a disadvantage after something was thrown from the head of the visitors.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team and led Ayr to reach the pre-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt stayed with the 11th and beat Hearts last week and would be delighted with the way his organizing team made their opponents outnumbered at every opportunity.
Rangers may have dominated in terms of possession but Livingstone did more with the ball when they had it.
They should have scored just two minutes after Menga's base gave Scott Pittman a chance on Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed his chance by hitting the ball clearly.
Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow couldn't get the clear at the post back.
The Rangers were in control but there was more hope than belief in playing them in the last match of the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have gotten a kick out of the smock after about a quarter of an hour after he and Steven Lawless struck but judge Steven Thomson ignored Colombia's appeals.
Rangers got two shots for the target in the first half but found before Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's penalty and Ovie Ejaria's offense.
Although Livi's goal after 34 minutes has been against the flow of the game, no one can argue that they didn't deserve it for their hard work alone.
However, Rangers and Dealers method and Jacobs deep play plans.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was upset when he passed to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard was like a brake as he changed Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and almost immediately the change had an effect as the assailant rushed to Morelos but Kelly rushed from his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play a type of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving long after long ball.
Holt's car might have added to their score in the final minutes but McGregor rose well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow hit a penalty from the corner.
Rangers second-in-command Glenn Middleton had another request for a kick out of the barrel after a deal with Jacobs but Thomson once again denied the request.
Almanac: The maker of the Geiger meter
And now a page from our Almanac "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and in CYFRIF... the day the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of intelligence, a development that would eventually lead to a device called the Geiger Meter.
As an important part of science since then, the Geiger Meter has also become an important part of popular culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starring as highly unlikely scientists.
Man: "Is that in the world?"
Rogers: "Measurer Geiger, it's used to find intellectual gems, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you'll be able to hear the effects of the atoms being released by the momentum in the mines."
Evans: "Well, it's making a bit of a runny sound!"
Geiger's "Hans" died in 1945, a few days before the end of his 63rd year.
But the device that was named after him continues to be used.
New Cancer Breed Can Teach the Immune System to ‘Weld’ Foreign Cells
New Cancer Breed Can Teach the Immune System to ‘Weld’ Foreign Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of a treatment.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, and adapting them in a laboratory
Then they will be able to ‘see’ a protein that is common in several cancers and they will be re-injected
Tests of the vaccine show promising results in patients and different types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, who is learning the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, and adapting them in a laboratory so that they can ‘see' a protein called HER2 that is common in many cancers, and then re-infecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising fever."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and/or respiratory cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and ‘learning’ them how to target cancer cells has worked to treat types of leukemia.
After his appearance on SNL, Kanye West began a campaign on Trump's side by wearing a MAGA cap.
She didn't go well
Kanye West was fired at the studio during Saturday Night Live after a controversial performance where he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for the presidency in 2020.
After performing his third from that night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again coup, was rigged against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I'm going to talk to a white person and they're going to say, 'How can you like Trump?
"If I were to leave the United States, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch including Matt Damon where the Hollywood star was making fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony near the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual misconduct by Christine Blasey Ford.
Despite not being broadcast, a video from West was recorded uploading it to social media by rapper Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to break West by posting it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had been bullied behind the stage for what he was wearing on his head.
"They were pushing me to the back of the stage.
They will say, ‘Don’t go out with the head then.’
They were trying to kill me!
Then they say I'm in a low place," he said, then the Washington Examiner.
West went in front of him: "Do you want to see the low place?" saying that he would "put my superman button on, because it means you can't tell him what to do. Do you want the world to move in front of him?
"Treat the love."
His comments were echoed at least twice by a SNL audience and the cast members were stunned to see, Variety recalled, with the same person telling the announcement: "The whole studio went completely quiet."
West had been added as a late second to singer Ariana Grande, as her ex-boyfriend the rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West caused confusion to a number by performing the one by I Love it dressed as Perrier's bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who said: "To one of the most brilliant characters: DIVIDED TO BE HAPPY."
But the presenter Karen Hunter argued that West is just "being himself and that's great."
But I'm opting for PEDIO to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "feel") who is in my judgment to condone and express ideas that are harmful to my community.
It's free.
And so are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that his new name was "the being formally known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who has also been called Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Her with rapper, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the recent Prince song changed its name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempting to murder after drinking at a restaurant in Melfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear near the Belfast Court of Appeals on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Seren Game of Thrones Kit Harington Kills White Widow
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has killed the stereotype of a male hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys feel that they have to be hard to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed ‘something has gone wrong’ and asked how to deal with the problem of venous femininity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who married all of her actresses on Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, recently, admits that she feels strongly about going into the trouble.
‘I feel strong at the moment – what has gone wrong with manhood?’ he said.
‘What have we been teaching men as they grow, in terms of the problem we have now?’
Kit is of the opinion that television is partly responsible for the increase in venous manhood and that due to the very masculine characteristics.
He went on to say: ‘What is regular and what is taught?
What's being taught on television, and on the streets, that makes boys feel like they have to be a special kind of man?
In my opinion, that's one of the big questions of our lives - how do we change that?
For it is obvious that something has gone out of its place for young men."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not make any other Game of Thrones programs when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he had ‘enough fights and fights’.
From November, Kit will star in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, a story of film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing to come from Game of Thrones.
“I met a woman on the show, so in a way my family gave me, and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Jon Snow's character Kit, in the fantasy course that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of the Leslie family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say that more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering.
About 40,000 new cases were identified in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the cases were transmitted by someone, noting a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of contaminated blood supplies.
But the number of people who still have HIV like this has been reduced almost for free, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan state.
But, from year to year, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased from 100,000 people.
Transmitting HIV through someone is a major problem in the LHDT community of China.
In 1997, the solidarity of his comrades-in-arms was found, but according to him, discrimination against LHDT people is rife.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have suggested that 70% to 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
There are many of the transmissions of the genitals as a result of inadequate sexual safety in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised general access to HIV medicine as part of a plan to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of staff has released data from Republican senators, killing ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘intelligence fantasies’
On Saturday, Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted information about three Republican Senators to the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were being spread by "extremely right wing" supporters.
"Tales, lies, and more lies," Walters said in a statement on Twitter.
According to the statement, the information released included home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information spread online on Thursday, after being posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing by a panel of the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh who has been nominated for the Supreme Court.
The information was released after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was related to the Waters office and they were released by a member of Waters staff, the Hill said.
"This unsubstantiated allegation is false and a blatant lie," Waters said at the time.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised as a result of the fraudulent and incorrect allegations - was not responsible in any way for releasing this information.
"This is a false accusation and a false lie."
Waters' statement was quickly condemned online, including a former press secretary at the White House's King Fleischer.
"That's a shame," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she doesn't have the nature to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they don't go out in anger.
They can't be reassuring.
They can't question the defendant's counsel.
They need to be calm and calm."
Fleischer appears to be comparing Waters' response to the Democratic nomination of Judge Kavanaugh, who was charged by judges of appearance in a court hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also gave his verdict on Twitter.
"Very true," he whispered.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had informed "the appropriate authorities and the agency to enforce the law from the fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed," he said, "and that they are responsible for the activities that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - pairing a weak sb<0xC3><0xAD>o with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new British-styled film and to see fit for this revival of the Johnny English comedy-drama series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there such a thing as the fact that we don't have the opportunity to change the world?
However, the Johnny English slot has been licensed to destroy everything back for the second time - with its name more than nothing to show that it is a comic character that has been created for moviegoers in countries that don't speak English.
Of course, this is the true scout who despite his celebrated claims include a little bit of Clouseau, Mr Bean, a man who contributed one note to by Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally based on the traveler and the secret man, Atkinson was playing him in Barclaycard's commercial, leaving the destruction behind him.
There's one or two good scenes in the latest Johnny English movie.
I'd love to see Johnny English go towards a helicopter wearing a gun and the rotor blades hit against his helmet.
Atkinson's tone is with physical comedy to see, but the humor is weak and strangely absent, especially now that "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy as part of their films.
The summer feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and I don't think Johnny English's true nicknames are as clever and specific as Atkinson's quiet jokes in Bean's character.
The idea is to be a great Britain in a great deal of trouble.
A cyber hacker has been campaigning for Britain's secret network of spies, releasing the identity of all British spies in the field, despite the fact that the officer on duty - an unfortunate and small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last step of the prime minister himself who is fair and surrounded, and who already suffers from enormous political instability. Emma Thompson is doing her best with the character Teresa Mayaidd but there's a great deal in the script to work with.
Her secret information counselors let her know that all asylum seekers have been threatened and that there will be some to come and someone out of retirement.
And this means Johnny English himself, who works as a schoolmaster in some sort of ranch institution now, but gives a secret lesson on how to be a scout: some good jokes here, while English pre-school scouts similar to School of F Rock.
English is transported back to Whitehall for an urgent meeting and he is reunited with his former partner Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is served.
So the Batman and Robin get things wrong back on their Majesty's service, coming across Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is busy being seduced by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can deal with Britain's computer problems: Jason Vola is being played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their laughable journey: dressed as servants, they put a French restaurant on fire; create a trap while trying to get on a Volta submarine; and English causes a complete mess while trying to use a Voltaire boat to escape.
They do a great show of it in the final scene, but despite so much fun and absurdity, there's a little bit of a sense of children's television about it all.
It's very important.
And as with the other Johnny English films I can't help but think: can't the British film industry play a role for Rowan Atkinson who makes teas with his talents?
The Labour Party denies that it is preparing a plan for the British people to work for four days a week but is paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would mean that the British people work a week of four days - but are paid for five.
According to him, the party wants the leaders of the companies to pass on the savings made through the transformation of artificial intelligence to the workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would mean that workers get a weekend of three days - but get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would be in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country from the workers' side.
A change to a four-day week has been approved by the Labour Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight but the four-day week is an aspiration that coincides with the party's approach to restructuring the workers' economy as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, with the Green Party promising a week's work of four days during its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at the moment the ambition is not approved by the Labour Party at all.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: ‘A four-day working week is not the party’s policy and is not considered by the party.’
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used the party's conference last week to broaden his vision for a social revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to get the power back from the public resource companies’ ‘dirty directors’ and ‘professors’.
The opponent's Chancellor's plans also mean that the existing shareholders of water companies will not be fully funded as the Labour government could make 'deals' on the basis of apparent wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on the boards of companies and create Comprehensive Ownership Funds to give 10 per cent of the equity of companies; the private sector in the hands of the workers, would receive annual allocations of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" that the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question that the FBI's findings could cause any Republican senator to want to sue.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham that the FBI could reveal something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina co-worker.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said before the hearing, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, I said to him, ‘Do you dare to do this?’
He was determined, determined, and undecided."
However, Graham's voice is strong to see.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and he would make a terrible accusation," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett was totally disgusted by it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one who calls her can confirm it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the world's largest economy and has done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Christmas of the World's End, an annual musical event that has a fascinating list of stars taking part and a message that is as fascinating as it is: getting rid of poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the World Heritage Holiday will see tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn at Central Park to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, as well as raise awareness of the festival's main desire to celebrate its 20th anniversary.
The New Year of Global Citizenship, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Plan, an international advocacy group that hopes to get rid of poverty by increasing the number of people struggling against it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket) visitors had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or anything else worthwhile.
But how successful has the World Endowment Day been with only 12 years after reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to persuade people to make a change or just in another case of "clickivism" - people feel that they make a difference by signing up for an online appointment or sending a message?
Since 2011, the World Heritage Day has said that they have recorded more than 19 million "actions" by their supporters, aiming at a variety of goals.
They say these actions have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that amount to $37 billion that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group referred to 390 commitments and announcements that were derived from their actions, with at least $10 billion of which have been classified or raised.
The group estimates that the funding that has been confirmed so far has had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK investors and operators who have committed to "helping children reach their full potential," promising to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help eradicate poverty and poverty.
"With the support of the UK government, contributors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make social indifference and lack of growth a milestone in history," said Tracey Ullman, curator of The Power of Nutrition at a rally in the city.
The group said the government had announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritious food, after more than 5,000 actions have been made calling on the UK to improve breastfeeding for mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions and their website was asking "what makes you think we can get rid of excessive poverty?"
He said: "It's going to be a long and hard road - sometimes we're going to fall and fail.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among some of the artists performing in this year's New York broadcast, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Llynges for "warchae" to block Russian energy exporters - Home Secretary
Washington can "if necessary" use the Lynx to block energy from Russia from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as requested by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's intervention in Syria - specifically, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is suitable for exploring new energy markets.
"I am of the opinion that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to deal in energy as they do in eastern Europe and southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways to deal with this.
"The United States has the ability, with our Lakes, to make sure that the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to give protection, to make sure that they do not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was speaking to the audience at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as the "lower energy user" in the U.S.
He went on to compare Washington's methods of dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are more or less the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to put pressure on and replace fuel," he said, noting that Russia's economy is completely dependent on fossil fuels.
The comments come as the Trump administration seeks to increase exports of its renewable natural gas to Europe, taking the place of Russia, the cheapest option down for consumers in Europe.
At the same time, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which Trump says makes Berlin "bad" for Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly reiterated that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is the only economic project that is worth $11 Billion and will double the current capacity to 110 cubic meters.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's bitter opposition to the project is caused by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"It is in my judgment that we share the belief that energy cannot be used to put pressure on and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Foreign Minister Alexander Novak said following a meeting with US Secretary of Interior Rick Perry at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
The U.S. position has received a sharp response from Germany, which has confirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany's main industry organisation, the German Industries Federation (BDI), has called on the US to keep the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be "Considered Able" to Apply for the Presidency in 2020, said the Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "consider it hard" to apply for the presidency after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting in a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she had considered applying.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and shake up our reasonable government and that includes women at the top," she said.
"After the 6th of November, I will consider it hard to apply for the presidency."
Warren gave his opinion on Donald Trump at the town hall meeting, saying he was "leading the country to the wrong address."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been undefeated in his nomination for President Trump and his nomination for Supreme Leader Brett Kavanaugh.
In a statement on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an investigation by the FBI before we vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters don't believe she should apply in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not stand up for the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Policy Research Center's poll.
Thirty-two percent of the population supported such an effort.
The penalty pool showed much more support for an effort by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent supporting a possible effort and 48 per cent against.
Other Democratic names that have been hailed as potential candidates in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will make an official decision by January, the Associated Press said.
Sarah Palin refers to PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, a year in Iraq after listing in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is suffering, what he is suffering from coming back, I can sympathize with other families who feel the effects of PTSD and the scars that some of our soldiers are returning with them," he said at a rally for Donald Trump.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other soldiers, "they come back differently, they come back harder and they come back to ask if there's any respect for what's on their shoulders and shoulders."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic assault on a woman, involved in a report of domestic abuse and having a gun in his possession while in custody, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support syalens for the new loches police
A dozen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that rejects space for victims who escape from domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives from the 18 states and DC presented a close friend-of-the-mill on Friday in Washington, D.C., in support of a police-challenging lock-in seeker, NBC News said.
It is the full name of the appeal in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy, without being disclosed.
He said his partner "and his terrible sons who were members of a gang" had been treated but U.S. officials denied his application for loches on July 20.
He was kept in the stable in Nhexas.
The tourneys of the state that supports Grace El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce many locust seekers in the U.S., have described as countries facing major problems with domestic traffic and gangs.
The new U.S. lockdown policy contradicts a decision made in 2014 by the Refugee Board of Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for lockdowns if they escaped from domestic violence.
The National Tour of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy was "ignoring decades of federal, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that any application for loches be adjudicated on the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a restriction goes against that principle," said the close friend-y-lys.
The tourneys made further discussions at the forefront under the policy of prohibiting entry to immigrants damaging the U.S. economy, saying they were more likely to be entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary work."
The National Tour's Jeff Sessions made an order that immigration judges do not give shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Location is available to individuals who leave their home countries due to persecution or fear due to their race, religion, nation, or a member of a particular social group or political judgment," Sessions said in a policy announcement on June 11.
It wasn't enough to solve all the problems - even the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Fire rescue efforts in Palu as the deaths double in the race to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly precarious.
"It's very disturbing," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who was counseling her sick son in a fudo center in the town of Palu.
"Every minute, ambivalence comes in and a body comes in.
The water is clean."
Residents were seen returning to their homes that had been destroyed, searching through their huts, trying to save whatever they could find him.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which had been damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were completely destroyed.
Some of the patients, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were resting outside Palu's military hospital, where they were treated in the open air due to strong aftershocks.
Tears came to his eyes as he spoke of the feeling of the earthquake in the darkened room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I've been taught to the remnants of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. embassy accuses China of bullying with ‘propaganda warnings’
A week after one of China's official new papers ran a four-page ad in a daily new U.S. paper promoting trade benefits between the U.S. and China, the U.S. embassy to China has accused Beijing of using the American press's propaganda.
On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump made reference to China Daily's addition to the Des Moines Register - Iowa's most popular new paper - after China accused of trying to interfere in the U.S. presidential election on November 6, allegations that China is working.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election is a new step in Washington's growing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to put in place trade-promoting notices, Beijing and Washington are currently fighting a growing trade war that has led to the two countries putting tariffs on each other's interiors.
China's tariffs early in the trade war were designed to target exporters in countries such as Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, experts from the U.S. and China said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Embassy to China and the former governor of Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "China is now confirming that package by running propaganda ads in our free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's important tradition of freedom of opinion and press freedom by placing a notice they have paid for in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the stall of new papers down this street in Beijing, you would find it difficult to find unsympathetic voices that you would not see a very reflection of the diverse ideas that the Chinese people have about the economic path of poverty.
He added that "one of China's most notable new papers has refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which paper.
Analysts Warn That Republicans Are Excluding Women Who Voted Before the Midterm Elections with Llanast Kavanaugh
While a number of leading Republicans support the nomination for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual misconduct, analysts have warned that they will see a response, especially by women, during the election period.
The emotions about this have been very high, and the majority of Republicans on the record are ready to say that they want to move forward with the vote.
You can't take these things back," Grant Reeher, a political science professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University at The Hill, said in an article published Sunday.
Reeher said he was in doubt that Senator Jeff Flake (G-Arizona)'s last minute effort to get an investigation by the FBI would be enough to silence unhappy voters.
"Women aren't going to forget what happened yesterday - they aren't going to forget tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson to the previous MoveOn group.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "The month of November a man is coming!" as they protested at the Senate hearing as the Republicans who govern the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Doctor Forineod.
"The enthusiasm and solidarity of the Democrats is going to be huge," Stu Rothenburg, a non-profit political analyst, told the news website.
"People say they're happy; that's true.
But it could increase, especially among insecure women on the streets of the cities and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony described his allegations of sexual misconduct against the nomination for the Supreme Court, analysis suggested that a strong response would have been made if the Republicans had gone ahead with the nomination.
"This has developed to be a full load for the Republicans," Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans have dealt with this and the way they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of ISA's Priorities, group.
But it seems that Americans are biased in who to hail follow Ford and Kavanaugh's evidence, with a little more on the side of Kavanaugh.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents are sure or against Ford's evidence, while 35% say they are sure or are similar to Kavanaugh's.
In addition, 38% said they believe for sure or are likely to believe that Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's campaign, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford along with at least one other co-defendant, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford gave evidence on the floor near the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked him while he was engaged when he was 17.
Ramirez claims Kavanaugh, who was named to the Lys Circle, introduced her to her sexual organs while they were at a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Device is planning to start a new Internet in order to get to grips with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of We World-wide, is starting a new company that will try to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new project of the technology innovator, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Berners-Lee Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose in-game where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In a select interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee lamented that Inrupt's intention was "to control the world."
"We have to do it now," he said of the company.
"It's a historical moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It may include contact lists, task lists to do, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional resources. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and with at the same time.
What's unique about the personal online data store is that it's up to the user completely who gets to see what kind of information.
The company calls it a "personal authority through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to Chief Executive of the John Bruce Company, is for the company to bring in the right resources, processes and skills to help ensure that Solid is available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform from IBM, developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteers.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers around the world could create their own declassified apps using the resources available on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about introducing a complete change where their business models are fully greened overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's intention is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the accuracy and quality of the new web that is being created on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when the World Wide Web Consortium was established at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over the indifference of the Internet.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the We Consortium, and the Open Data Organization.
"I am very much looking forward to this next half in the history of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the First World War Victoria Cross Clergy
The only English Church clergyman to win the Victoria Cross as a fighter in the First World War has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Under-Secretary of State Bernard Vanny won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a secret satirist four days later without knowing that he had won Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two acquaintances in a cemetery in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his men, Michael Vann, said it was extremely symbolic that the stone was being unveiled exactly 100 years after the match that won the award to his father.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1928, the Vann Sub-centre led its fatality across the Saint-Quentin Canal "through thick fog and attacks by field forces and machine guns."
Later he rode to the dance line and with the "greatest bravery" the line led forward before running to a field on its own and cheering three of the crew.
Vann was killed by a German soldier on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his father's actions were something "I can't ever compare but who betrays someone."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann set a torch after the war, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very happy to be part of the team" adding "that the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that is given by so many people."
MMA supporters stayed on their feet all night watching Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pink in his place
Imagine this, you've stayed on your doorstep at night to watch Bellator 206 just to get you banned from watching the main show.
The San Jose event included 13 corners, including a chip on the main card and was shown live through the UK target on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face each other, the viewers in the UK were left surprised as the screen changed to Peppa Pinc.
Some of them were unhappy with the fact that they stayed on their feet all night, especially to watch the ornest.
A Twitter supporter described the change to children's gardens as "some kind of bad joke."
"The government's regulations said the content wasn't appropriate after 6 a.m. so there had to be a change to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa's wet," he said.
Scott Coker, head of Bellator, said they will be working on their timeline as it will include viewers in the UK in the future.
"I'm thinking about the re-emergence, we can make it work," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday there and we won't be able to deal with this until it's Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the change programs made a lot of text messages were going back and forth and they weren't all friendly.
When we tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the problem, it was a government issue.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We'll have to keep it to five corners instead of six - as usual - we tried to give too much to the supporters and it was a long giveaway.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'extremely' due to his sexuality
Lead author Tom Daley says he has grown up feeling subservient to everyone else because of his sexuality - but that this has prompted him to succeed.
The 24-year-old plumber said he hadn't realized until he went to high school "not everyone is like me."
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs to be presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights in order to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent has made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
A regular presenter of the long-established program, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a guest on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than" everyone else growing up "that it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, of feeling differently, have given me the power and the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they found out about his sexuality.
The swimmer who has won the Olympic silver medal twice has become a prominent LHDT campaigner and used his appearance in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more of the countries of collective bargaining.
He said he has declared his verdict because he feels lucky to be able to live openly without prejudices and that he wants to give "hope" to others.
The world champion said he fell in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who made his meeting in 2013 - "it's going to be unexpected."
Daley got married to Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he was, last year but said the age gap has never been a problem.
"When someone goes through so much at a very young age" he went to his first Olympic games at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - she said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had lived through high-points and expectations.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all prospects" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But there's more to it than winning Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets for London 2012 again - he wanted to be in the front row.
"I can't say to him, 'You're not going to be around to be in the front row,'" he said.
"I was holding his hand as he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and he was dead did I admit that it was not illegal," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a silver medal.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to bloom in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
He also made his first choice - Proud of Heather Small - who had retired from the pre-Olympic games and was still giving him a glowing skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, who is not at his best on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phill Mickleson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his standard to avoid getting an unlucky milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the two-year event for the 12th time, was put on the bench by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for the penultimate and quarter-final games.
Instead of being in the middle of the activity, as it has been so often to the United States, Mickelson, who has won five majors, shared his day between being a supporter and working on his game in the hope of improving the problems he has.
As the youngest of the riders was not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not a good choice for Le Golf National's thin course, where the long neck earns a competitive jump.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickleson, in the ninth game on Sunday, is the face of the right British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has worked with the Tommy Fleetwood team to win each of their four games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points down at the start of the 12 singles game, get a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely essential.
Furyk showed confidence in his man, though he couldn't do anything else.
"He understood the role he had today, grabbed my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was expecting more, but so she worked out and so we thought we needed to go.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else."
Mickelson will record Nick Faldo for the most number of Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never reached the highs of its individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk says his presence is an unbeatable boost to the team.
"It's funny, it's sarcastic, it's funny, it likes to have fun on top of people, it's a great person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the young players have fun making fun of his head as well, this week, it was nice to see him.
It's a lot more than just a scratch."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big advantage can quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day of individual games in the Ryder Cup can turn into an uncomfortable journey.
Daniad's first game was at Valderrama in 1997, where a team captained by Steve Ballesteros scored a five-point advantage over the Americans, but by the end line the advantage was down to a blue hole with Europe winning from 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
Remember that we have a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we're at heart, and in Valderrama, where we're only earning from a bluff hole," said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 team win 5 to 3 on Friday and go to National on Saturday.
So history will show me and everyone else on the team that this is not over.
You've got to do your best tomorrow.
Go out and do the right things.
It's not over until you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the trophy, and that's where we'll focus.
I've said since the beginning, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our squad, but we're also aware of what's going to stand out - the best players in the world."
He was delighted with the way his players have performed on a hard golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never be a genius about this.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come to the fore, and that's a completely different thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there on your own, you're pretty much tested as a golfer.
That's the message you need to give to the players, which is to do your best tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner and he has to do his best as well."
Unlike Bjorn, American captain Jim Furyk will want his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk has been on both ends in the big wins on the last day, as he was part of the team that won at Brookline before losing after Europe secured the "Worth in Medinah."
"I remember every word of it," he said after being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain, did in 1999, cheering his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like to start as fast as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When the momentum goes in one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those games in the middle.
"We're putting our line up like that and putting the men out the way we want, we're trying to do something amazing tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the fight back and faces Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other European players in the top half of the order.
"I'm with this group of players in this order because I think they'll work well all the way," Bjorn said of his choice for the individual games.
Germany's New War Ship Has Been Delayed Again
Germany's new lynges frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but will not be available until at least next year due to poverty and rising cost systems, local media said.
The commissioning of the "Reinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the new paper Die Zeit referring to a speaker on behalf of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Llynges in 2014, but problems after its provision have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships that were ordered by the Llynges in 2007 will take the place of the old Bremen class frigates.
According to the report, they will include powerful cannons, rows of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles along with some secret technologies, such as radar signatures, sub-woofers and less sound.
Other important features include longer maintenance and maintenance periods - it should be possible to install the new frigates for up to two years away from their home ports.
But continued waiting means that the innovative warships - which will allow Germany to throw its power over the sea - will be after the era by which they will begin to serve, Die Zeit said.
The F125 fleet was at its peak last year, after Germany's Lynges refused to commission the ship and return it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Llynges had returned to shipbuilders after it was delivered.
The reasons behind the ship's return were unclear, but German media referred to a number of essential "software and hardware flaws" that meant that the warship was not good enough if it had to fight.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be run by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the numbers on the Bremen class frigates.
It also became apparent that the ship over weight was an island that worsened its performance and reduced the Llynges' ability to add improvements in the future.
The "Rhineland-Palatinate" is believed to be 7,000 times more powerful than similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the lack of hardware, the price for the entire project - including training the staff - is starting to be a problem.
It is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1billion ($3.6bn) - up from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2billion to start.
The problems of the new frigates are becoming more and more important in view of recent warnings that the power of Germany's lynges is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the Llynges were "running out of ships that could be intercepted."
The official said the problem has worsened over time, as old ships have been father-commissioned without new ships being provided in their place.
He threatened that none of the Baden-Wuertemberg class frigates could join the Llynges.
The National Trust is listening to the hidden lives of stalwarts
New research work is being done on a standstill in Highlands of Scotland that seeks to reveal how a sturgeon uses the landscape to hunt for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique mammals and will help with conservation activities in the future.
The study by scientists of the National Trust of Scotland will follow the least common stylus on at least soprano stylus as well as long-lasting stylus and water stylus in the Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important places around the site in order to keep an eye on the activity of the instrument throughout the season.
Volunteers and staff of the GIG will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held diagnostics.
An expert sound analysis of the recordings will find the frequency of calls of the instrument and what species are doing what.
Then a report and a map of the habitat will be produced in order to create a detailed landscape size picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant of the nature of the National Trust of Scotland, hopes that the results will show which habitats are most important to the sturgeon and how they are used by all species.
The information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as creating forests and how to manage forests for plants and other related species.
The population of slums in Scotland and across the UK has decreased significantly over the last century.
They are under threat from construction and development work that affects their joints and leads to loss of limbs.
Wind and mud storms can also be dangerous, along with drought arrest paper and some chemicals in building materials, and attacks from insects.
The shadows aren't blind.
But because they are cold at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to holding their food.
They use sophisticated eco-location technology to see the objects and obstacles that are ahead of them.
The National Trust of Scotland owns more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important estates and more than 76,000 hectares across the country and they are deeply concerned about the flooding.
They have ten trained experts, who conduct regular surveys, visits with clubs and from time to time savings.
The organisation has set up Scotland's first star conservation facility on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, its home to eight of Scotland's ten star species.
The station manager David Thompson said the station's landscape was perfect for them.
"We've got a great place to stay," he said.
"We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of old trees and all that stuff.
But there's a lot we don't know about astronomy, so the work we do here and on other sites will help us understand more about what's needed even though men are able to float."
It focuses on searching for a star before doing any maintenance work and keeping in buildings as it could destroy a single celebrity cluster killing up to 400 female and young stars, killing all the possible local population.
It is illegal to kill, injure or destroy them or destroy their cages, and it is illegal to protect them.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Astronomical Preservation Trust, has been urging the public to give help.
He said: "We have a lot to learn about our ecosystem and with many of our species we don't know if their populations are doing well or not.
Ronaldo dismisses accusations of treason as his lawmakers prepare to pursue a cycle of Germany's revolution.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the accusations of treason against him "fake news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to follow the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published the allegations.
A Portuguese and Juventus leader has been accused of harassing an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a room in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
In fact, he reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on Instagram Live to its 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news."
"Na, na, na, na, na, na.
What they say today, fake news," said his player, who has won the Ballon d'Or five times, to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added, crying.
Ronaldo's lawmakers are preparing to pursue Der Spiegel because of the allegations, which they have called "an unacceptable report of doubts in a private matter," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, the lawyer, said the player would seek compensation for "an amount of morale equal to the seriousness of the crime, which is probably one of the most serious crimes in terms of personal rights in recent years."
The event is said to take place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are told to return to the player's room, where he made his transfer electronically, according to the papers that were filed with Clark's County Sheriff's Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his lines after the alleged incident and tells her that "99 the dog" was a "good man" who was disappointed by the "one-hundred".
The documents state to Ronaldo that they have had sex, but it is consensual.
Mayorga claims she goes to the police and pictures have been taken of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court arrangement because she was "fearful of a deal" and worried about "being publicly acquitted."
The 34-year-old woman said she was trying to reverse the arrangement as she continued to be harmed by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from the United Kingdom when the alleged attack took place, and this summer he moved to the Italian club Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: The UK would be sorry for the loss of car makers forever
The UK would be "forever sorry" if it lost its status as a world leader in post-Brexit car production, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC they would do their best to produce temporary cars at its factory in Burnaston near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a meeting," said Mr. Clarke.
Japan's carmaker said it could sit on the border leading to job losses if Brexit had not been agreed.
The factory in Burnaston - which builds Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year and nearly 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if Britain were to fall out of the EU at the end of March, construction would stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's director at Burnaston.
Other UK car makers have raised concerns about the impact that leaving the EU without a deal will have on trade across the border, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said that they will close their Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what the car manufacturers say risks in the supply chain if Brexit were not agreed upon.
Toyota's production line is run on a "only in time" basis, with parts reaching every 37 minutes by suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars being built on order.
If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal on 29 March there could be problems at the border, problems the industry says would lead to delays and a lack of pieces.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than two days of stock in its factory in Derby, the company said, so it would have to put an end to the construction.
Mr Clarke said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU "has been carefully designed to avoid such border investigations."
We need a deal. We want to get the best deal that will allow us to succeed in the present and take advantage of this opportunity," he told the Today programme on Radio 4.
"The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with a series of performance chains that have been very successful."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production work would end, but in the long run, it warned that additional costs would affect the factory's ability to compete and that it would eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of Unite's union assembly at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "From my experience once these jobs have gone, they don't come back.
A spokesman for the government said: "We have proposed a detailed and credible plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could be postponed again, the White House said.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Rod Rosenstein's national daily could be "expanded for another week" as the fight over the nomination for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference in the election, ties between Trump's and Russia's aides and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
Trump's dismissal of the national day's decree, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been on Washington's lips for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a device to record his conversations with Trump along with the possibility of getting rid of the president by using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein wrote the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, saying he was about to apologize.
But instead, a meeting with Trump, who was in the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "better not to" dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the hearing of the Senate's ruling committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Here's what he said about the meeting with Rosenstein: "There's no date set for that yet, it could be this week. I can see that being postponed for another week because of all the other things that happen in the top court.
But we'll see that I always like to give the latest information to the press."
Some reporters would have doubted that statement: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said there was no dissatisfaction with the "orchestration" of television journalists that was the reason for the lack of whistleblowing, although he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they are overcrowding."
He then suggested that the direct link between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president is doing more Question and Answer sessions than any previous president," he said, adding without giving any evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."
Sanders said the briefing would continue, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that often and you've seen us do a lot of that in the past few weeks. This will happen instead of holding a press briefing where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often receives questions when leaving the White House or when he is taking part in open sessions or press conferences with important people he visits.
There is a small amount of pressure on the press.
In New York this week, the president showed why, in making a bold appearance and from time to time in front of reporters.
The health secretary writes to EU workers in the UK due to concerns about Brexit. . . .
The health secretary has written to EU staff who are working for the Scottish NHS to express their appreciation in the country and wish them to stay there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to pay for the application fees for the status of a permanent resident for EU citizens who work for the declassified public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving have continued, and decisions are expected to be made in the autumn.
But the UK government has also been pressuring preparations for the possibility of a ‘no-deal’ situation.
I'm sure this is going to be a tough time for all of you.
That's why I want to say again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, no matter what their nationality is.
Co-workers across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
I'm sure your home is your home and we're very much looking forward to you staying here."
Christion Abercrombie is in a hurry to get an injury to his head
Christion Abercrombie's line-up backer who plays for the Tennessee Patriots has been rushed into surgery after suffering a head injury as the team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores from 31 points to 27 on Saturday, according to Tennes's Mike Organ.
Tennessee's head coach, Rod Rees, told reporters that the injury had occurred half a time ago.
"He came to the side line and some kind of whip there," Reed said.
He gave oxygen to trainers and medical personnel to Abercrombie on the sideline before being placed on a stretcher and pushed back for further assessment.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there were "no details on the type of injury than how bad the injury is again" and Tennessee County is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is a second-year red cross student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after he was transferred from Illinois.
Five tackles were received throughout Saturday before having to leave the game. That came with a total of the season's tackles to 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to support the home under new plans by the Tories.
This proposal will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
This increase in stamp duty will be given to those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects it to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the home.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK - and the additional money will be used to provide assistance to the home.
This proposal will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with pledges to provide more affordable homes and to topple those who earn big wages.
The increase in stamp duty will be given to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK. The additional money will encourage the Government's intention to go to deal with people who are sleeping out.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-in-homes - can be as much as three per cent.
The Treasury expects this offer to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's new property is purchased by residents outside the UK, and this increases prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to gam around the home school.
Many of the country's rich areas - especially in the capital - have turned into "invalid towns" because so many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high when buying land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to do her best to lease affordable homes to repair the "house wall" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a dramatic series of proposed housing reforms, including rent management and ending the transformation of people from their "free" homes.
He also wants to give more power to councils to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year, I said that I would commit my work as prime minister to restoring the British dream - that life would improve for every new generation.
And that means that we're going to have our own market.
"The UK will always open its doors to people who want to live, work and create this life."
However, it may not be as easy to buy homes for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies that are located abroad, as it is for UK residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house is far from being within their reach, and the process of sleeping out on the street continues to be far too real."
Jack Ross: "In the end, my ambition is to control Scotland."
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to be the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Albanner is excited about the challenge of reviving the North-West club, which is currently in the third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-hole and that's it," Ross told Sportsound, the Scottish BBC's programme.
"When I was a kid, I was able to watch Scotland in Hampden a little bit with my father, and it's something that has never been mentioned to me.
"That's going to be my only chance, if I'm successful in managing a club."
Ross' predecessors as directors of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic manager says he had no fear of tracking such strong names in such a large club, and he has rejected previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich.
“Success for me right now will see ‘can I lead this club back to the Premier League?’”
Because of the structure and facilities of the club, it belongs to the Premier League without if or not," he said.
"It's not going to be an easy transition to get the club there, but I probably wouldn't consider myself a success unless we could get the club back there."
Only three years have passed since Ross began his career as a manager, having spent time as a sub-manager in Dumbarton and 15 months as one of Hearts' training staff.
Then it was helpful to raise Alloa after they fell to the third floor, and change St Mirren from falling to being on top of the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a bit of a cross-sectional point," he said as he remembered taking the wings in Alloa.
"I really believed that being a manager was the right career for me, more so than being a player.
It sounds crazy because I did it right, I made a reasonable life out of it, and I gave it a go at the top.
But the game can be tough.
There are a lot of things to do on a weekly basis.
I'm still going through that in terms of the stress and workload, but the management feels right.
I've always wanted to be a manager and since I've achieved that, I now feel more satisfied with my world than ever."

The perfect time for what is 5:30 a.m. on Saturday night, according to a survey.
The hot weather in the summer has given a boost to the profits of British restaurants that are hard to get, but it has put more pressure on the food chain.
Groups of bars and restaurants saw an increase of 2.7 per cent in sales in July - but a reduction of 4.8 per cent was seen in food house gains, according to figures.
Peter Martin of CGA business consulting company and collected the figures: "Because the hot weather has continued, and England has stayed in the World Cup longer than expected, a pattern quite similar to June and was in the second half of July, a place to watch.
After the 1.8 per cent reduction in the grocery store in June, things went from bad to worse in July.
Foods and bars that were selling performance drinks performed best by seeing more progress than seen eating houses from a loss.
He also sold restaurants that focus on selling food because of the sun, although not so much as people running food houses.
It seems that going out for a drink was just what people wanted to do.
Throughout the restaurants and bars being managed, there was a 6.6 per cent increase in beverage sales for the month, while there was a three per cent reduction in food."
Paul Newman of RSM's leisure and hospitality analysis company said: "These results show a continuation of the wave we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social events or in the sports world continues to be the main factors in terms of sales in the market outside the home.
It's no surprise that food groups are still suffering, although a reduction of 4.8 per cent a year after year will be sure to be painful as well as constant cost weight.
"The long and bitter summer couldn't have come at a bad time for people running food houses that focus on selling food, and the time and momentum that August's more average temperature will give some of the soap it really needs."
In July, there was a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in restaurants and eateries, which included some new ones that were opened. This reflected the slowdown in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the UK restaurant and restaurant sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups. They have a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and they are the industry's established benchmark.
One in five children have hidden social media accounts that they keep from their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have hidden social media accounts they keep from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed that there was an increase in "Fucking Insta" pages.
The news has exacerbated the concerns that the content of sexual nature is being posted
Twenty-one percent of the students said they had an "account" to show to their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has shown a rapid increase in "fake Instagram" accounts - which refers to the site of sharing Instagram photos.
The news has raised concerns that the content of a sexual nature is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "book" account suitable to show to parents, while they also had private ones.
A mother came across a hidden site of her 13-year-old daughter and saw a child in her footsteps encouraging others to "recover me."
The research, led by Digital Awareness UK and the Private Teachers' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, has found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom agree to keep private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: "It's alarming that so many children in their teens are being challenged to create online sites that parents and teachers can't find."
Doyle will be the "little athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletes.
At the governing body's annual general meeting, Second Doyle has been selected to be on the board of Scottish Athletes as an inactive director.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete, and Ian Beattie described the decision as a great opportunity for those who lead the game to benefit from the wide range of experiences she has had at the international level across the board.
"It's a great honour for Second through the community of Albanian, UK and world athletes, and we're sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit a lot from getting it on the table," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be a voice for athletes and hope that I can contribute and help lead the game in Scotland."
The American won the 200- and 400-meter race at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics at the top of his other four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular fixture on the BBC, but was unable to walk after suffering a couple of temporary ischemia.
He wrote on Twitter: "Until today, I've had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it's time to decide whether to improve or to what degree to improve.
It's been killing but I've completely improved, I've learned how to walk again and today I'm doing stretching exercises!
Thank you for all the messages of encouragement!"
There is a variety of opinions online about pump advertising that almost compares moms to pregnant women.
A variety of opinions online is an advertising skill from a pump company almost that compares moms who feed on dairy to being spoiled.
To mark the launch of what is known as "the world's first almost-disappearance pump that can be worn first," the Elvie technical goods company has released a cellweirus ad in the form of a music video to show the freedom that the new pump is giving to its mother.
There are four real mothers dancing in a pile of woods and woods in it, to a piece that contains words like: "Yes, I'm beating myself, but you don't see a rock" and "For fear that you didn't notice, it's just these rocks."
He said, "I'm going to eat the baby, I'm going to eat the baby, I'm going to eat the baby, I'm going to eat the baby, I'm going to eat the baby."
However, the ad, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has been a subject of online fire.
With 77,000 people having seen the video and channels having commented, it has received mixed reactions among viewers, with some saying it does not "encourage" the dairy industry seriously.
"It's a very bad decision to use a commodity to advertise this product."
As we need to prepare and give birth in order to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.
Almost Elvie's pump fits neatly and from the look inside in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mom)
Another said: "It's understandable that this is traumatic for the mother and baby.
But why don't you use them to advertise a pump almost to moms who keep their babies?"
Another added: "An advertisement that doesn't understand the world is one of us."
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she saw the song as "over-the-top act."
"This is a great idea.
I'd have had one if I still ate from scratch.
It's made me feel like a scoundrel.
It's a bit of a pain in the ass, but I took it for what it was.
"It's a great product," wrote one
Another said: "This is a full-blown fun advert aimed at mums who pump (often in the workplace or dolls) and feel like a "beard."
It's not a matter of judging or judging the industry, it's the advertising."
At the end of the video, the group of girls reveal that they have been dancing with the pimps hidden in their arms.
The idea behind the campaign has been based on the belief that many women who are pumping from the forehead feel like shit.
However, the Elvie pump is completely free, does not have wires or tubes and it fits neatly inside a nursing bra. This gives the freedom for girls to move, to get in their baby, and even go out while they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Creative Director of Mother's Executive said: "Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and ambitious launch.
In showing the similarity between the front bumper and the front bumper we wanted to draw attention to the front bumper and all its challenges, showing the incredible freedom that comes from the new pump in a neat and convenient way.
This isn't the first time Elaine has made it to the finals.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the stage to planner Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of thousands of children have been displaced to the Texas border
The number of children who are being kept from escaping has suddenly increased, although the numbers that cross the border every month have not changed much. This is partly because of the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that made it impossible to do so.
Traditionally, most donors have been self-immigrants without the right to be in the country, and they have been worried about jeopardizing their right to stay in the country as they move forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that the provision of fingerprints and other adults in the house would be forced to give fingerprints, and that the information would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified in front of Congress that they had arrested dozens of people who had applied for the appointment of underage children without a company.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of those who were arrested had not had a criminal record.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are conspirators or members of the same house with conspirators, live in the country illegally, and a large number of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to go after those individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being held, rather than after 60 days, which was previously customary, according to tenants.
Many of them will appear through a video-conferencing call, rather than in person, in order to appeal their case for legal status in front of an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unfit to receive assistance will be sent out of the country uninvited.
According to locksmiths and reports that have appeared from the system over the past few months, the longer children stay in the shelter they are most likely to feel anxious or low in their spirit. This can lead to a traumatic accident or an escape attempt.
Claimants say that such concerns are worse in a facility more like Tornillo, where signs that a child is suffering can be ignored, due to its size.
It was added that moving children to the city away from home without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or flirt with friends can worsen the trauma that many are struggling against.
Syria is telling ‘dominated forces’ from the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
Under the auspices of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on refugees from Syria to return home, although the war in the country is now in its twentieth year.
Moualem, who is also a top minister, said the foreign forces on Syria's soil were illegal, prone to fighting terrorism, and would "handle them appropriately."
"They need to be taken back immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem said that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with more than millions displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have cleared all of Syria's territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces from Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops fighting the country that has been destroyed by war.
Speaking to refugees, Moualem said the circumstances were right for them to return, and he blamed "a king of the western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that encouraged refugees to stay through.
"We have called on the international community and charitable organisations to facilitate the process of their return," he said.
"They've made a very sensitive issue a political issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to put an end to the war.
U.N. diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a listening area at the last important stronghold of Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to move forward with political negotiations.
Due to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, it was possible to avoid a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia on the region, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "suspended time limits" and said he hoped that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front who are affiliated with Al-Qaeda, who will "end their demise."
With this, Staffan de Mistura, the UN chief hopes to call for the first meeting of a new committee that will include members of the government and opponents to draft a post-war composition for Syria and prepare the way for it.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government to take part in the committee, saying the panel's work would be "review of the current articles of the composition," and warned them not to interfere.
Why Trump is going to win a second term
From then on, Mr. Trump could be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many of the libertarians hope, he is certain, that a escalation and scandal will put an end to his presidency soon.
And that would, without a doubt, be the "most dramatic ending to a presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, high-hour figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
On average, Fox News has 2.4 million peak hours viewers, which has risen from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" programme has improved on the figures of cable television watching with as many as 3.5 million viewers on nights.
"This is a text that attracts people because we don't understand it," said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," referring to a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack that destroyed the capital.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another speculation.
She remembers a trip in taxis in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said of, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
There's entertainment in the middle of the mess.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories that come from Washington can decide the future of Roe v. Wade, and can be brought back together with families who have re-integrated, and the state of the wider world economy.
It's only the most talented viewers who have the ability to turn off the TV.
And again, it's going to be more than a conscious dentist when you realize that on the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts are arguing about the use of Bob Woodward's words "a thick background" as he tracks down information for his book "The Fox," the Fox and the Fox.
I don't think I'll ever be able to watch Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what makes you feel like it's a reality show is that it's feeding you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars" about the Trump program's characters being turned upside down.
You can't afford to miss a single chapter or you'll be left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern shore of Kauai, but he had swat inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't leave the screen, not with Brett Kavanaugh at the end of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the vantage point.
"I remember when we were doing all the crazy shows there for a while and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of the West's legacy,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but the truth about it is that they're right."

Money from outside flows into the mid-term electoral race in the House
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives a flood of money, thanks to the reshaping of congressional districts that means there are two runners in the race for the same seat.
The newly re-elected Pittsburgh metropolitan area is in favor of Conor Lamb who is a Democrat - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another rival, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps a bit with the 17th district.
The maps were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional evil on the part of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has held a campaign fund fight between the main parties' funding rounds, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania has had a close victory in a contest that received much attention in March in a special election to the 18th Pennsylvania Congress District.
A Republican had held the seat for over a decade, and President Trump won the region by 20 points.
The Democrats are saying that the Democrats are ahead of the curve.
U.S. condemns El Salvador for granting aid to China, then pulls back
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, without much unfavourable response from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm-up meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Banama in June 2017. He had a stay in Manama until partners turned a Trump Foundation management team out.
Officials of the State Department decided to call heads of diplomatic mission back from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recent determinations to refuse to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the department's office, in a statement.
Penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, which included drug control, economic aid and development.
The sanctions proposed, which included cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been targeted, have been painful for the country in Central America and its high rate of inaction and killings.
As internal meetings moved forward, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference that focused on security and economic well-being to go on the course of a similar meeting that was held last year and which was intended to be a disaster.
But by mid-September, senior government officials explained that they wanted the conference to go ahead, and thus put an end to any consideration of punishing El Salvador.
The diplomats said Vice-President Mike Pence had been earmarked for the conference, which was scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance the administration places at the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any difficult new messages or quotes from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to give details of the dispute that was described by the three American officials, which included two diplomats who agreed to speak about the internal negotiations on the condition that they were unknown.
The reports were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration who also spoke on condition that it was unknown to us.

It is possible that the next major event will be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller on the possibility that Mr. Trump has stalled justice, where substantial evidence is now in public records.
According to all accounts, Mr. Mueller's report also discusses what Mr. Trump's campaign was planning with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If the Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to face responsibility for that body, and he is preparing to go before voters again, and perhaps even more of his contemporaries in the long run.
There's a lot of uncertainty about that, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's downfall is insurmountable - nor his allies in Europe.
We all need to make choices on both sides of the Irish that will have an impact on the length of the effort.
In 1938, German officials were ready to hold a coup d'état against Hitler, if the West had only resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We did it, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of vacation that we had.
The course of history revolves around such forming points, and the journey of democratization is accelerated or curtailed.
Americans are now faced with many of these shaping points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep water ever since this paper reported last year, he has secretly suggested recording the president and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
"How will we respond if the new F.B.I. inquiry does not ask Brett Kavanaugh fully or fairly - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite allegations of credible sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
First of all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections of Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail to do so, it will be difficult for democracy.
But I don't think we'll be able to do that because of the lessons I learned in school.
A Jew from Czechoslovakia was my mother who was educated in Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that was at one time occupying my dream home.
She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light the candles on the table that appeared the swastika.
And that's part of my heritage, how can I not be hopeful for the future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers team is a runner-up before playing against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory against the Austrians will follow the equal game in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, meaning they are in a good position to apply from the Group G England.
He hurt his head-to-head that Graham Dorrans couldn't play this season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes the Rangers can use that result to achieve great things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
We started the game thinking that we could get something we got out of there with a point.
We may have played in the end but, on the whole, an equal game was a result of more than a dozen.
They're probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the best team.
As of Thursday night, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but that will be difficult because they got a good result in their last game. But with the village supporting us, I'm sure we can work hard and get a positive result.
The year was definitely challenging, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that were made in the club itself, but there's a great feeling in the place now.
The car is good and the boys enjoy it very much; the exercises are good.
I hope we can catch up now, forgetting about the last season and succeeding."
Women are losing sleep because of this fear in terms of retirement savings
Despite the fact that those who took part in the survey had a good idea of the way they wanted to be cared for, only a few people were talking about it with family members.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their husbands about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a member of the family to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have that conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Life Insurance Nationwide.
This is where the beginning begins.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't let your wishes know far in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to receive care, because those choices can be important factors in determining the cost.
You should include your financial advisor: your advisor can help you think about how to pay those costs as well.
Your options in terms of long-term care financing can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid value-for-money life insurance policy in order to pay for those costs or self-insurance with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Let's take a look at your legal rights: Stop legal disputes.
Make sure you have health care blocks so that you're appointing an individual you trust to monitor your medical care to make sure that professional workers are complying with your wishes so that you won't be able to communicate.
In addition, you should also consider adversarial for your financial matters.
You would choose an individual you trust to make your financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills are paid if you are able to do so.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your aging parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write these details in a written plan so that you're ready.
It's about more than financial matters, who's the doctor?" asked Martin.
"What are the medications?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
"Create that plan."
A man was shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle as he walks home after a night out.
The victim, who was in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Dymnaint, when he was shot in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which took place around 02.30 BST, as a "step-by-step action."
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries do not endanger his life and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of deaths likely to rise.
With connections broken, rescue officials have not been able to get any information from the Donggala programme, an area north of Palu that is closer to the tip of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been forced to move after the earthquake struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi state, at the end of a hilly bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population target of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck the city.
Donggala is a programme that spans more than 300km (180 miles) from the coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The program, an administrative area under a province, had a population target of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic operators of the Central Sulawesi state, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Mining for nickel is also important in the state, but most of that work takes place in Morowali, on the other side of the island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also struck west of the country in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ocean's Seismic Fire Circle and is plagued by earthquakes on a regular basis.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the state of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along India's Central coast, and more than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra state.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The Pidie Jaya earthquake hit the runway in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people are reminded of the earthquake's aftermath and the dangerous tsunami in 2004.
The tsunami was not caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by falling buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Lombok, a tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists stranded there for a time.
Sarah Palin's Son Arrested for Domestic Violence Charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and deputy presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, ignoring reports of domestic violence and rejecting the arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman identified him trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes, his phone was taken from him.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-Su Correction Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured fund, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "young, definitely" when asked where he was, according to the network.
Palin faces three charges of Class A misconduct, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and be fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with B-Class drug possession, which has a day's penalty in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to inform them of the alleged attack.
The case is currently being brought before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of disregarding the reporting of the crime of domestic violence, and of assaulting a gun while engaging in connection with the incident.
His love for her was that he had put a punch in her face.
Sarah Pilan was convicted by pre-war groups in 2016 after she linked her son's menacing behavior to PTSD that stems from his time serving in Iraq.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami: dogs killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake has caused a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication networks have broken down and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake struck near the centre of Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are shared on social media showing the time of the event.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the lake.
Federal prosecutors are calling for the maximum punishment for the man who is suspected of carrying out the horrific attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the ultimate punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the one suspected of the horrific attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a short sentence that has not been given in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rental truck from Home Depot to attack a bike path along the West Main Road in Manhattan Isaf, beating the walkers and cyclists who were on his way in October.
In order to justify the maximum sentence, the pursuers will have to prove that Saipov has killed the eight person "involuntarily" and caused serious bodily harm "involuntarily", according to the warning of a will to seek the maximum penalty, which has been imposed.
Both of these courts are able to give the maximum penalty, according to the court's document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury charged Saipov with 22 counts of murder that included eight counts of murder for the purpose of fraud, charges that are usually used by federal prosecutions in cases of rape and rape.
The attackers said the attack called for "significant provocation and planning", describing Saipov's attack as one of "foolish, crooked and slender."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused injuries, injuries and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadet, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pangnu," he said.
Five of the victims were tourists from the Aryans.
A decade has passed since New York's Southern Area introduced the most expensive penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the punishment was given in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after they were convicted of embezzlement at a funeral in the village of Oshkosh.
Both of them were put to death in a powerhouse on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, who hails from Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told authorities he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the statement.
He also asked for an ISIS banner in his room in the hospital, the police said.
He has been charged with a felony charge of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the defenders representing Saipov, said they were "sadly disappointed" with the outcome decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the punishment rather than receive an innocent plea for life in prison without the possibility of being released only extends the trauma of these events to all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had already asked the pursuers not to try the maximum penalty.
As Toryian says Nigel Farage should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “act on the voice of the people” today during a protest at the Doryaid conference.
He said before the UKIP leader that politicians have to ‘feel the pressure’ from European members - as one of Theresa May’s own colleagues suggested he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
In the Birmingham rally, Peter Bone, one of the Conservatives behind the scenes, said that the UK would “go out” by now if Mr Farage was a Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces as she reassesssed her highly-favoured offerings based on Dorians who are on the side of Stay join another protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister finds it difficult to keep an order on his Chequers plan in the midst of attacks by people who are on the side of Brexit, people who are on the side of Stay and the European Union.
Councillors have said she will still try to strike a deal with Brussels in spite of the delay - forcing European members and Labour members to choose between her package and 'remain'.
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to ‘beat Chequers’.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have made him a lord and given him the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If it had been responsible, we would have gone out by now,” he said.
AS Wellingborough added: ‘I will stand for Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers.’
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: ‘We did not fight in world wars to be secondary.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone ignored suggestions that indicated that public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay completely wrong.’
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory Brexit member, was also in the opposition and told reporters: ‘I say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are not popular among the public, the Opposition is not going to vote on the plan, it is unstoppable among our party and our active members who walk the streets in order to choose us in the first place.
Don't push ahead with Chequers and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: ‘The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their assets.’
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must ‘feel the pressure’ if they wanted to defy the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to cheat Brexit and we’re here today to say to them, ‘We’re not going to let you do that.’”
In a message to the angry village, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel that pressure.
“We act on the voice of the people of the country who have ensured a victory for us in terms of Brexit and we will hold on until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
In the meantime, people who were in favour of Stay through Birmingham encouraged to attend a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
A handful of Tory flag-waving activists have taken to the streets in Anti-Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
One of the Lords of Labour, Lord Adonis, made fun of the Conservatives because of the security issues they had with the party's app as the conference opened.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have TG systems in place and all the technology for Canada’s barge plus, for awkward ends, for borderless free trade in Ireland,” he said.
“It’s totally cool.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren is serious about applying for the position of president.
Elizabeth Warren, one of the U.S. Senators, says she will "look closely at applying to be a leader" after the November election.
The Boston Globe says the Democrat from Massachusetts has spoken out about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who regularly judges Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a state representative on behalf of the GOP, who co-directed the Massachusetts Trump campaign in 2016.
There has been a lot of speculation that she could compete against Trump in 2020.
At the event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon, she was meeting with voters for the 36th time using the town hall format since Trump took office.
She asked if she was going to stand up for the president's position.
Warren said it was "time for the girls to go to Washington to overthrow our reasonable government, and that includes a girl on the top."
Arrested after Sims of LSU was shot to death
On Saturday, the police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that someone had been arrested on suspicion of shooting Wayde Sims, a football player from LSU, to the death on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET news conference at 11am.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man who was to be seen in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed at a South University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died immediately as a result," Murphy J. Paul, one of the police chiefs, told media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde came in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the site, holding a gun, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without investigation and was taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot and 6-inch young boy who was raised in Baton Rouge. He had played in 32 games starting 10 of them last season and his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 opponents of the game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team order helps him win ahead of Sebastian Vettel
It became clear after Valtteri Bottas applied before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's arrangement would play a big part in the race.
From the post, Bottas had a good start and was almost left Hamilton in trouble as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel went to the first pool leaving Hamilton to reach the traffic at the end of the pack, something that should have been illegal.
The Mercedes went to the lap pool later coming out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead of him after coming to himself and saw the Ferrari driver, unhappy, leave the inside free in a danger of being able to go after a rough ride.
Max Verstappen started from behind the grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race as he held on in his diary to try to finish quickly and pass to Kimi Raikkonen to secure the fourth spot.
In the end he came to the polls on lap 44 but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen came to fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri has done great all weekend and he was a blessed man who let me down.
"The team has done a great job of getting one," Hamilton said.
This is a very poor body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her bravery that she did not share the letter by Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated for the Supreme Court, of sexual misconduct.
While speaking at a rally in North Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the evidence Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he said that what is going on in the Senate shows that people are "gas and evil and evil."
"The same thing could happen and the blessed thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the dictatorship, when you see people who are ugly and evil and lying," he said.
"When you look at the statements and the documents that are shared and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Cofio?
Dianne Feinstein, did you share the letter?
Remember his answer... you shared the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, by the way.
I didn't share the document."
Well, wait a minute.
"We didn't do it, we didn't do it," he said, adding that the president's decision was not to do so.
Feinstein received the letter containing details of the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, and was split at the beginning of September - but Feinstein denied that the letter had been shared by a member of his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't share his story," Feinstein told the committee.
She asked me to keep the letter secret and I did so as she had asked me to."
But it did not appear that the president believed him, and made a note during Saturday night's rally: "I tell you something, the language of his body was very bad.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the names of the Supreme Court, which has been accused of sexual misconduct by three girls, the president suggested that the Democrats use the allegations to their own detriment.
"They are determined to take back the power in any way that is necessary," he said.
You see the hate, the curse, they don't care who they're punishing, who they have to defeat in order to have power and control," the president said, according to Meditate.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars did well for losing in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants won early as Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beuvillier scored two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to score the home team before Dwyer regained the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard scored the score for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals ensured their victory.
This is the third time Adam Keefe's men have lost in the Elite League this season, a team that had beaten Dundee 2-1 unexpectedly in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth time the teams have met this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with help from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford helping as Beauvillier doubled the score four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan and the home team returned to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped deliver an equal goal to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants won the lead in the first half as he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and, once again, Bouchard made sure they had an equal score with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nielsen put Dundee ahead for the first time in the game late in the second period which ensured the victory by scoring his team's fifth goal half way through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are playing at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure Hundreds Can Escape Airplanes from a Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is called a hero after he died ensuring that an airplane carrying hundreds of people is safely lifted from the earth.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many are sinking in a rumbling in the town of Palu.
But despite his co-workers having fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his work at the highly sheltered control tower in Pau airfield, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He stayed there to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the run at the time, was able to get up safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought he was falling.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision had saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia said.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to be transported to a hospital more in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it in the morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"The news is shocking," he said.
In the meantime, authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could reach thousands with the disaster relief agency saying that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is likely that the number is still rising because a lot of bodies are still under the poor and a lot of bodies we have not yet reached," said a spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The six-meter-long tonnage has broken Palu, who will hold a funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft come with support and supplies. . . .
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambivalence brings a body here every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
People are taking away from the small supermarkets all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
The situation is already bad, but it could be a lot worse."
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the movement and the movement.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which caused 550 deaths.
A plane crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a plane crashes into a lagoon
The airline, which was flying a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, now says one man is missing, after saying that the 47 passengers and all crew have managed to leave the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they had not seen a man who had been on the plane since Sunday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
A local boat helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it attempted to land in the Chuuk Island airfield.
Officials say seven people have been transported to the hospital on Friday.
The airline said that six people were still in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the crash and how exactly it happened.
The U.S. airline and Llynges said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane had gone over the course of the flight.
Bill Jaynes, a traveler from America, said the plane had flown in very low.
"That's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others had been able to walk through water to their center to the emergency exits of the plane that was sinking.
He said that the plane's crew was screaming and screaming, and that he had a small wound to his head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors were working to improve nearby seas and had helped save people by using a wind boat to transport people to the sea before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in plane crashes that have been registered with PNG in the past two decades but one of them did not include Air Niugini.
A woman's body was found on the night she was burned alive.
The result of his case was presented on Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He outlined how he used mobile phone records to create a full picture of the 29-year-old defender, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said she had received location data from many mobile phones that showed Tellis with Chambers on the night she died, breaking their previous claims, The Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his mobile phone with Chambers' mobile phone during the time he had said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday, saying he wasn't in town that day.
When the pursuers asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was at Sanford's bar that night, Sanford said he was "saying a lie, because my bar was in Nashville."
There was another disagreement that Tellis had said he had known Chambers for about a week when she died.
The phone records show that they've only known each other for a few weeks.
Rowlett said Tellis had deleted text messages, calls, and Chambers' contact information from her phone sometime after she died.
"He took it out of his life," Hale said.
The defenseman will begin his closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to go to the court later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop?

Nani from New York is pursuing a couple for his resignation following a "nightly" text message
A ninja in New York City is chasing a couple for discrimination against her and dismissing her after she receives a text message suggested by the mother complaining that she is "another black bear."
The couple denies that they are cynical, saying that the situation is as if someone is "trying to profit."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when she saw that the childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After noticing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "unfortunate", dismissed Ms. Maurice, saying that their old nanny, who was African-American, had done a terrible job and that she was expecting Post-York, in New York, back.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her work day and then sent home in Uber.
Now, Maurice is chasing the couple for compensation because she was fired, and she's trying to get compensation of $350 a day for the six-month work with accommodation she's been hired to start, despite no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do things like that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is a case of differentiation."
The couple has condemned the allegations that they are cynical, saying that ending Maurice's employment was the reasonable thing to do, as they were concerned that they could not trust her after her divorce.
"My wife did something that she didn't want to say.
She's not squishy.
"We're not human beings," said the man, Joel Plasco, to the Post.
"But would you put your children in the care of someone you've been unfaithful to, even if that was a mistake?
"Your new baby?"
I don't think."
Comparing the legal case to "a situation of someone trying to profit," Plasco said his wife is expecting a baby within seven weeks and she is in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going to follow someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do," said the banker.
Despite the fact that the legal case is still going on, it was a long time before the public court condemned the couple on social media, judging them for their conduct and their rationale.
Paddington publishers fear readers won't unify with the art they're talking about, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to change the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
Now, it's very rare to know what we know about Paddington's basketball success."
He said that his father, who had been working as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a young ten-year-old boy, would have accepted the fact that his work had been rejected, but added that celebrating 60 years since his death "was a huge milestone."
He said his father was proud of Paddington's subsequent success quietly, describing the art as "a very important member of the family".
"He was a very quiet man, and he wasn't a violent man," he said.
"But because Paddington is so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of the child even though you're not really responsible for his success.
I think he's considering Paddington's success that way.
Although his creation and his imagination were the work, he always gave Paddington the heart of his own."
My daughter was dead and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After her discharge, her daughter was rushed to Loius Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in an offer to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that things were very bad, and she wasn't expected to come through," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call because Nad says she's going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The drugs she was given by the doctors to keep her heart racing began to come to an end and leave her system.
She had died a little before that, and now everything was shut down.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing this was all happening.
I couldn't stop crying or crying because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be brave."
Soon after, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieving the loss of her daughter, was on the plane side by side with the other passengers - who was unaware of her ordeal.
"No one knew," he said.
I held my head down, and the tears were falling all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt the bitter feeling of compassion for Nad.
I needed my love and my understanding of it.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women in pain post cards to prevent self-inflicted injuries
Two girls who have lost loved ones due to suicide, work to prevent others from ending their own lives.
Sharon Davies and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, the son of Ms. Davis, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and he killed himself when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son is a widower and has a fever.
"Everyone remembers about his father.
"They were always saying that his eyes were lighting up any room."
However, he did his best to do his job before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he killed himself.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always worried that it's going to have an impact again."
Ms Davis drew the cards, "to let people know that there are people who can go after them and talk to them, even if they are friends.
Don't sit in silence - you have to talk."
Ms Humphreys has been friends with Ms Davis for years, and she lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after he lost her mother.
"He didn't say he felt sad or low or anything like that," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He had reached the bottom of one Christmas Day - when the children opened their gifts he did not make any eye contact with them or anything like that."
He said that his death had been a huge blow to them, but that they had to come through: "He's shaking a hole through my family.
It's breaking our hearts.
"But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the spotlight as the FBI begins investigating
"I thought, if we could get something like he was asking for - a limited investigation in terms of time, limited in terms of surroundings - maybe we could secure a little unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid he would be embarrassed.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their relationship is a matter of time.
Only five weeks to go until the midterm elections, on 6 November - if, according to the expectation, the Republicans will do badly, then they will be significantly weakened in terms of their efforts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court.
George W. Bush has been raising the phone to call Senators, pressing them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, where he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
I will be voting in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh could get at least 50 votes down the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice-president, to come to a decision and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s refugee numbers ‘declined’ under Kim’s leadership
The number of people fleeing to South Korea has dropped since Jim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a lawmaker from South Korea.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South's union administration, said that 1,127 cases of last year's escape - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the tighter processes to control the border between North Korea and China and the higher rates that people smugglers are raising are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most of the people who flee from the North are offered the citizenship of South Korea at the end.
Seoul said more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of it flows through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is a country where it is easier to cross than the highly protected Geographical Area between the two Goreas.
China refers to those who flee as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and it often forces them back to their own country.
The relationship between the North and the South - which is still in a technological war - has improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries held a meeting in Pyongyang for talks that focused on the denuclearization talks that had come to a standstill.
This was followed by the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, as they had a fresh discussion about working towards getting rid of a nuclear weapon in the Korean Peninsula.
But, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho welcomed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will not defend ourselves at all," Mr. Ri said in a statement to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "horrific", saying he's not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, called Brett Kavanaugh "horrific" saying he was unfit, due to the nature of his character, to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribulation Festival in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman had behaved like that, I'm sure they would have been called 'horrible'," Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional in spreading the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two of them were in their thirties.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost crying and crying at times when discussing his family and his period in high school.
He also specifically condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying the allegations against him were "destroying his good name in a consistent and counter-productive way" and that was orchestrated by liberals who were upset that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's evidence proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because his evidence showed he was prejudicial to Democrats.
"I think it shows that he is incompatible with those statements and the way Clinton supporters and the Democrats have been accused," he said.
Peter Pelosi was asked if she would seek to be confirmed, and if the Democrats had won the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm going to say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be in the Supreme Court or to be in the court he's in right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat she was concerned about possible cases of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether it would be contrary to certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time to have someone rude and presumptuous in court waiting for us to say, 'Is that great?'" Pelosi said.
And the girls have to talk about it.
It's a fair conversation, months and years of stubbornness are cringing, and you can't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're mad," Ms. Steinem told her 45 years later.
I don't think that's weird, do you?"
He went ahead, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an active officer somewhere, who said that she cries when she's angry, but that she has developed a technique and so, when she's crazy and starts crying, she'll tell the person," she says.
I'm the son."
And then I'll carry on.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed to give expression to dictation in part because they are, in principle, misunderstood.
One of the most obvious memories I have of an early job, in an office where men were in it the most, and I cried out with a dictation beyond words, an older woman caught in me in the words of my mother-in-law - a cold and bitter ruler who was everywhere.
"Don't let them see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're a jerk.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad that you've been punished."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a carriage outside of a wedding on a monkey named Monkey Business and pulled back from the race, Ms. Schroeder, who was very confused, realized that there was no reason why she should not think about applying for her job.
"I didn't think about the decision properly," he told her, laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing he needed was another one.
Someone called us "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because she was late in the campaign, she was behind her in terms of raising money, so she promised she wouldn't take part in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a bitter battle.
She noticed that some of her supporters who were giving $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he asked.
When she announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, her feelings went too far for her - thanks to the people who had supported her, confusion with the system that made it so difficult for her to raise money and harass voters, who were reluctant to vote.
"You'd think my nerves were broken," Ms. Schroeder said of the way the press responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my bodyguard.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my rock?
"Did she cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be on Beijing's side
The first tons of the trade war between the U.S. and China were enough to satisfy someone, and even though the battle did not go over, a wedge between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave the first warning this year by imposing taxes on China's key exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase was introduced this week with new tariffs affecting the value of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) of items, taxing, for all purposes, half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has paid the price back each time and, most recently, it has set tariffs from five to ten per cent on $600 billion of American goods.
China has pledged to match US efforts and is not the largest economy but one of the world's most likely to collapse soon.
Getting Washington to do its best to comply with the demands, but publicly impeaching the U.S. would raise too much shame on Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts say if Beijing can get around it properly, the weight of the U.S. trade war could support China in a positive way in the longer term by ensuring that the two economies rely less on each other.
"The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic panic in both countries and the rest of Asia is, in fact, far more dangerous than what viewers have previously been aware of," he said.
Syria 'prepared' to receive asylum seekers back, Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily accept asylum-seekers and is appealing for help in rebuilding the country that has been ravaged by seven years of war.
Under the auspices of the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions were improving in the country.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and safe, thanks to the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is working hard to renovate the areas that have been destroyed by deserters to restore normalcy.
The conditions are now right for asylum-seekers to return to the country after having to flee from terrorism and the damaging economic measures that have threatened their daily lives and their lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There is a need for humanitarian aid for six million people who are still living in the country.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that he would not receive support with conditions or assistance from countries that had supported the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European Team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six consecutive times on European soil, and they have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe managed to secure a victory as teammate Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Denmark, reached the 14.5 point required to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson had a difficult turn, but when the U.S. star's ball landed in the water on the 16th hole of the par-3, he had to submit the game to Francesco Molinari.
Molinari, the golfer from Italy, had starred in all rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players to win 5-0-0 since the tournament changed to its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the weakest player on paper in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top goalkeeper, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to England's Ian Poulter who was playing more than likely in his last Ryder Cup.
And while playing in his eighth Ryder Cup, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became one of the most successful players ever in the history of the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help that today.
She's been a difficult year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for putting his faith in me.
I'm so happy we got the cup back.
The team is important, and I'm glad I've been able to help," Garcia said through his teeth after Europe won.
The baton was handed over to fellow U.S. golfer John Ram, Tiger Woods, 2&1 in the singles game on Sunday.
"I was so proud to play Tiger Woods because I grew up watching him play golf," said Rahm, a 23-year-old boy.
Woods lost every of his four games in France, meaning his record is now 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
And that's a strange statistic to one of the best players ever as he has won 14 championships in his career, second behind Jack Nicklaus.
And with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had played so well throughout the tournament, the U.S. Team had been in trouble throughout the weekend to find the clear path.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of the team here, they're fighting hard.
We've put a lot of pressure on Europe in the morning.
We've been fighting.
You've got to give Thomas a thumbs up.
He's a captain without his second.
All of his 12 players have played very well.
We will fight back. I want to work with the PGA in America and our Ryder Cup Committee. We have to move forward.
I love our 12 players and am happy to be a captain over them.
You have to raise your head to them.
They've played better than us."
