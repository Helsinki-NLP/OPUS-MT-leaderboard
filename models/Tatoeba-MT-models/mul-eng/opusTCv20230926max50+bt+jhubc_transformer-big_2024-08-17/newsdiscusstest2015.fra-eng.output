UKIP residents who reject those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the undesirables.
First you use special arguments, then you discredit them by a barely veiled homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to queue behind chronic hypochondria intolerant people who think everything is due to them.
I think it's you who's using special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-hand rails, practically does not exist.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP’s measures against health tourism, so there’s no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a torch does not constitute evidence.
Then shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it did only comment on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You also don’t know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when trying to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
Farage’s phrase has surprised a lot, but only because we talk so rarely about this problem.
He did not make any homophobic remarks.
You will have to be able to get it back to you.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don't like it when the media talks about what you don't like.
We talk about it so rarely because unlike Farage and his clumsy followers of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, so no.
Finally, the situation is as bad in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis that comes the period of austerity, nothing will be fixed.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland, the 'Tiger of Europe', was proud of us a few years ago.
We know the suite!
It starts again to read the article.
We are trying to make sure that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a ''NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE'' is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, imposed on the lowest companies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients, there is nothing to ‘powder’ for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 80s of the 20th century, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development has not been a long quiet river, it is in view of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's wrong!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on companies.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France of the policies on the taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If one believes a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars all over the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily caps since the arrival.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will catch up soon.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hangover on the A140.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so a few bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two when he's shot.
So it would be entirely the fault of the other driver.
Did Ryanair make passengers pay an additional fee for the additional fear that we were willing to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish companies, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane it was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can make themselves happy.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic rate have only to take care of themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be happy with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error of the airport air traffic controllers.
Passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally grouches around the world.
People do not come in bulk for the quality of restaurants (any, for the most part) or for the Salon de la Revue <0xC3><0xA0> l'Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With a lot of foreigners who spend .....
Do you think Sunday’s opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, crowded with people with 50% tourists.
<0x40>Aloes Faux!
The only argument that would seem amenable to me is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy in detaxation.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
There remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right that, with the exception of employees, benefits.
This is why it is provided and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the minister in charge of the economy, nor, for the rest, the minister in charge of foreign affairs, has the least competence to reform the labour code.
While they're hugging her.
What's the law for?
Satisfy some of the population and businesses that want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday am I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my town of 30000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is the access to culture...
This is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter’s estate was, against his will, to be used to pay the inheritance fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some are not terrible.
No doubt his successor would want his piece of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Neither do I.
But for 5 years, and only for 5 years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he led the other aristos of the government who wanted to discuss an “agreement” with the Nazis and he very skillfully won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and of France, and of Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had for these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and none else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to raise the money from inheritance fees, they might even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A relaunch of the internal market through public works will only benefit large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, with infrastructure works being by definition unrenewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect well the real evil of France:s distrust of dialogue
Return to the prince values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Either in solidarity we come to his aid, or he has RIGHT in return for the services he renders or has made to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the tenant who lives from the income of his property.
It is necessary to differentiate between the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives from his rents.
A property to rent or even two for a couple above, it's vice versa
The little genius of finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of great infrastructure shortage.
Today, in Europe and in France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline emerges in response to a recession that is only a wild, therefore brutal decline.
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then, the need for investment is screaming: isolation, renovation of the railway network, urban transport, transportation and energy storage etc...
A tax that promotes high incomes and rents.
Who is in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur really is a galopin.
Samsung’s profits are put to the worse by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple’s mid-September introduction of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have lured buyers who otherwise would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided to buy the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft introduced this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they can not be satisfied by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people don’t attach any value to the design, for them the options, the functionality and the price premium.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let’s stop looking for “a better platform”.
Is there a "better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
This is what is of interest to us all.
I’m glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it’s not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, are fighting ideas and not the men (on the contrary, well on Parisian fools) could tell us which author(s) they are fighting ideas about the genre and tell us the books they are just about to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Is it Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I love you, and you're someone who's smart and cultured.
I said that about Judith in Furusato’s vein evoking Holopherne, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I didn’t have his wits).
Otherwise, in the "bottom" as you refer to it, I am not interested in this subject, and honestly I do not see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my back because I am slow but I understand well...
<0x40>Jean: culturally, send Judith back to Holopherne, it does.
Who is afraid to ask the world?
But what are those who are afraid of?
Furasato and <0x40> give us some answers.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic slasher of the throat.
We can see how much these studies affect the most intimate at home.
Obviously, we are no longer in the discussion of ideas.
It's something else, much deeper.
<0x40> Have you read, Jean, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
<0x40>: As for an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
Pretending to fight ideas from the only exposition that their detractors make of them (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of Gender Theory or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But well, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it's all the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic teardrop of throat, I was content with the "Second Sex" (it was more of my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I was looking at the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a little for the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was great here at FNQ.
Yes, last night’s cloud would really bury the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Flash special blood moon.
Tony Abbott/Joe Hockey makes Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will give it its true color as soon as possible.
It's obsessed with you, isn't it?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself during the entire week of Perseid meteor showers and for virtually all major astronomical phenomena in recent years.
I'm starting to think that there's a bad genius whose only goal is to stop the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne really isn’t the best place for an observatory, even though things are greatly improving on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes where I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburb of Melbourne.
I'm going to put a tax on this eclipse.
WHO watches this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsesse you when he (obligates) disappears?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed with EUX.
Beautiful photo of the moon above Sydney's Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is colliding with Earth!
Nothing on stock market and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequality between income from work and capital.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing on the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
There is no hypertext link to the original documents so that an opinion can be made.
Check out the results of the miracle recipes on Tuesday, October 15th: in Spain, exports have been at their lowest for five years.
In Greece, the stock market collapses.
However, these are the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a request for compensation of the order of 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of Economy tells us that these claims for compensation are not justified.
What if there is an error from the Ministry of Economy?
Will decision-makers who have engaged in the political profit resulting from the courageous attack of notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The sequel in its time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
The state is not comparable to households in terms of managing its budget because the state's time horizon is theoretically infinite while that of the household is bounded by the lifespan of its members.
In addition, unless public spending is considered unproductive, public spending contributes to the financing of material and intangible investments that will benefit from the growth of tomorrow and therefore future revenues.
Some elements of response.
A regrettable decision.
But remember Hippocrates’ sacred oath: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all else.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not correspond to your fantasy.
Medical personnel would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands tied by law as written by policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to please the uncultivated masses.
In fact, doctors don’t make money with medications.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don’t make money with drugs Since the Liberals want our health system to look like that of the United States, you should find out how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame the toubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to corporate profits and “research.”
So read the few rare reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme expenditures and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies over other countries.
Compare the worldwide prices of drugs present everywhere, as well as the differences from country to country on what is on sale or only on prescription.
This reinforces itself is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently doing trials on marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that curb them and the necessary expensive permits.
Although manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are being used, those who arrive at a version offering high-quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you ma'am but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a person in charge of this hospital.
We can't get patents on the grass...
If “researchers” in social sciences were doing research instead of doing politics and networking, their “work” could be used.
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not seeking.
Comparing is making pedagogy not research.
You can’t say “the research is done we have to apply it” and then in the same jet “we have to experiment at all”.
If your research has been completed, why experiment?
If your research is not completed, why do you ask us to apply it?
Can I explain how a “researcher” can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they manage to learn new technologies if they do not know how to learn?
Pisa tests are just an indicator we make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the point of building an indicator that informs you of what's going on, a will to self-promotion, a scam?
There is only one way to train teachers: to distance sophists and ideologues from training and to teach practitioners.
factory rewrites the paragraph on internships (which is unfortunately not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of current practices, and which does not allow the system to progress" .
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it is not desirable that only practitioners should teach practitioners, even if they have all their place in a modern training of teachers.
Theorists of education should have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the educational system.
To give more weight to the theorists of education would be to destroy it definitively.
Your analogy is totally ironic: if I did not want to be operated on by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I would like to be operated on even less by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the crowd.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP in charge of the fight against copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright, I will just read an article like this one.
In an information economy, copyright infringement <0x3D> vol.
It’s the same because they have to cite their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a copyright violation.
Not at all the same thing.
By using content without having the proper license, you deprive the artists of their breadwinners.
You can always discuss pedantic hypotheses - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't be as true.
This is a violation of copyright.
Go on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright
Apparently, you don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school homework, an almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the general conditions that they have gone through with a click.
Perhaps if they share the listeners of their mp3 walker with a friend in the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in this way.
Ah, if we could export this resource that we are refueling, the streamer who says that everything is going wrong....
If it's a PS member who's saying it, then we have to believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are old enough to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed from here.
France pulls people down by continuously assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What pulls France down is speeches like yours.
<0x40>gus I have been working in a private company ever since.
I had the chance to work in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France, but it is rare.
I’m an employee because I know I don’t have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red bullets on the bare bosses I meet frequently.
At ease in my basketballs I totally share Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan’s post: he says the horrible truth!
<0x40>gus, if we compare with German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to demand reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, especially by ensuring the link between large and medium and small companies - What do French employers expect to do about it?
Should the state hold their hand?
Is this the state they accuse of empire?
<0x40>Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couple on your side!
Remember, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be as severe?
<0x40>Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who are bouncing and undermining while waiting for the permanent assistance of the state!
It's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employers’ burdens, taxes, working 45 hours a week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages if not their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this topic.
What is ironic is the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see from where I’m from, Last wasn’t really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay in the flow rather than transform themselves.
This does not mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since Last dealt with it.
But they also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we don’t have the power to do that, unfortunately.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But well, Labour is going to get us in trouble, isn't it...
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the UK from creating a more moral business and taking part in the calls for tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all this so that the decision is finally annulled.
And there’s better: MTR, a Hong Kong-based company, has won Crossrail’s operating contract for 8 years.
Well Labour, as they repeated to us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and thinks that workers must all push themselves beyond borders.
So you can assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Perhaps it is because the management of the Dutch is on good track while the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchiser.
“She was a beating girl.”
Lord, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "beating" is a higher quality than many others, caring for others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "beating", who are not less dead, I guess.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's start again too.
I'm not telling you that it's the condition to manage, I'm telling you it helps.
It has nothing to do with any merit...!
When it comes to the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll start again.
Insinuating, if only for a moment, that one can have the merit of getting out of a disease or that one can demerit from not getting out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body either follows or does not follow.
A body that lets go, everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, do you have a vague idea of what C is?
Hard to think otherwise, if, having a strong moral will probably make it easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare for it, to try experimental treatments as this woman did, and not to refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is fighting in medicine, is above all someone who trusts in medicine.
But if one prefers to go back to the "Lord" it's another thing.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you get rid of yourself to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally, I caught two of them, dirt, big ones, and if I "fightd" like these psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only in tightening the teeth, suffering hell and cashing in the punches.
I believed that the charge against Milosevic had been decided and finalized a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted "quickly" and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story that was told at the time?
The communist became a nationalist who triggered three wars in the Balkans over the past decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask us what we have voluntarily left out: 1.
How could NATO’s bombings be legal under THE WORLD RULE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW?
Which country has Serbia attacked? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why not mention that NATO destroyed this same building by killing civilians, then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to detach part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was readily recognized by the Western States which then lied from end to end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for not being able to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
In the end, the Guardian shouldn’t call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn’t like him).
To my knowledge, there is only in Greece a method of predicting earthquakes works about, measuring the piezoelectric level in the quartz.
This type of study is unquestionably useful and thank you for letting us share the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus that would be "the smallest and coldest planet" according to Dracula's "draining water pipeline".
method to follow.
Just like those that involve animals feeling a threat to happen.
Thank you, Science Passer, for often regaling us with these experimental feats that are realized in the world.
How do animals know (in advance)?
There is no doubt about the perception of other elements whose rate is changing in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas a priori odorless to man but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments he has.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report about the combat of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work dealing with the sensitivity of animals to Earth's magnetic fields, and more particularly with their modification before a quake.
So I'm not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or is it about these researches?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should relearn to listen to nature...
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by the animals, we meet at the same time: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned oddly round.
I don't understand how one can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and he's always trying to have fun with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said that he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor and he didn’t keep one.
It's just pointing out how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, isn't it?
Because it is popular.
Because he's funny.
It was in “Have I Got News For You.”
Because it's a celebrity and we instilled in people the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and it will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the party's lead, the Tories' popularity rating will break the ceiling I'm sure.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what the Londoners were saying.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than him
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French have truly and always been disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have struggled to read a few books (there are some of them, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "ferraille Strait" speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there by heart since the battle of Savo) do not want to return there.
We actually passed in front of the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission touches its end.
It's the little ones.
But the ecol side is a total smoke.
Calculate the kerozene consumed to achieve the goal totally decredibilizes the concept..
Just browse through the list of sponsors Que des philanthropes.
An operation of comm no longer does or has to do.
The cow, it gives too much envy!!!
I look forward to the web series!
Your recipe makes me review, identifying me a little at the pass (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of travel.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to make us review, and show with pride that the Bretons are great travellers!
Pierre, from Trinidad and Tobago.
Bonsoir I think that the red hat that has been shown against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local communities and public bodies of all kinds should not devote a sum of our taxes to financing the dreams of some adventurers even as friendly as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian formation who are of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once at Juventus and now at Fenerbah<0xC3><0xA7>e, are from Mitrovica, but I don’t know if they are still in the team.
This is Bisevac the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfield or before in the 70s and 80s and has coached many teams in Greece, but I don’t know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and played as an attacking player in Velez's great team which, under the guidance of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also featured scores such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the teammate Wed<0xC3><0xA8>re, Wed<0xC3><0xA8>re.
Well, thanks, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and as far as I know there is no license.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is, the flag of this drone is not the flag of real Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Great Albania, which encompasses all the regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little bit of nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (which I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give the country's borders to neighbouring countries.
How can one have felt “an explosion of joy” by seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and children are undoubtedly inside?
How??
What bothers me a little in this "testimony", is that the only fact that I could, only once, spontaneously rejoice at the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies to my eyes of a "border line" personality whose "testimonies" should be taken with the greatest care.
There is no doubt that in the short moment of "joy" one will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
One would have just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had succeeded in really and apocalypticly harming the great evil Satan in his very heart.
Let's make it strong.
That's great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims who have been torn apart by their sense of humiliation.
With evidence filmed in Palestine.
Classique Schadenfreude.
We had a little bit of a doubt.
The "Christian/White/Gaulian" West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Muslim Arab world.
I'm talking about the faubourgs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnificent, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this diabolical funnel?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world: bigot conservatism and fascist nihilism.
The common point is the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That we have understood before, we must not turn back the Muslims.
It's the only way.
Do you want to read this article?
I suppose that is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
In addition, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I suffer from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is to cut the breath in autumn.
Not as much to cut the breath as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Great Britain, if you are lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a nice summer this year, don’t make your grinch that rattles the clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I no longer develop immunity to germs from outside, it can change, I guess.
It’s not about dying, it’s just a step in a cycle.
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a feverishness that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and full of other wonderful words.
Just don’t stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child enhancements , it is the amount cashed by the state that essentially comes from decisions 8 to 10 .
But with regard to the number of households that have seen their tax increase as a result of this measure , it is mainly Deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to Chart 2 .
The elimination of half the part concerning mainly widows is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And he's not ready to settle.
Well, we're not on the straw for sure, but singers
Once the PS makes a policy rather of the left we will not cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% have to endure much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let’s continue this way and you will encourage these 20% unless you work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Live the Trots and the OCIs recycled to the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
An equitable tax is when it prohibits anyone from collecting as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money has been exceeded, money is only used to make money, that is to say to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We are among the richest 20%.
There is no doubt also the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth some of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to take advantage of some of their efforts.
Or so much lower your arms and live with social minima, especially if you have a social housing.
The utopias of the headscarves of the Khmer Rouge have fortunately lived.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5 star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or face any hassle.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep in there, hang out behind you and leave.
This will be my first choice when I travel.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases, you will need some kind of homeowner’s insurance.
Make sure to use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six o'clock too late.
I love Airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and highly risky” No, it’s not true.
You just really missed your luck.
According to the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb’s response to Teman was quick, almost absurdly quick.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change locks, made arrangements for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article cite Teman complaining that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
J'ADORE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I am looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I’m considering paying a deposit and a month’s rent at once but I’m a little afraid to send <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 to a site I’ve never really heard of.
But where are we going?
“Support the troops,” the Bu$herie sang in all its tones.
Innocuous weapons.
I am sure it will please the families and close friends of thousands of halabjad Kurds to learn that their parents and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Moreover, in what way would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper clear the author's style: "In search of weapons of mass destruction.
We're in agreement.
Do you think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education?
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are always at war.
Alternative: Is it ALWAYS time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if they were “worked” for 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
And let's not assume that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But it doesn’t happen because National Education doesn’t have the means to provide an office at the college/lyceum to its teachers so they’re bossing at home.
Some sort of forced telework, except that the employer does not pay the computer, the internet connection, or the supplies.
Besides, it's so flat at 17h a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't get to fill the CAPES of maths, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to hang out with ill-educated bastards whose parents spit on you while treating you like a scoundrel?
I believe that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Kurdish population can thrive better.
Where we can see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything through.
My first job as a graduate was in sales, in London, to earn three times nothing and yet it was a position for which a degree was required.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London Underground, it was paid <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 more per year and we didn’t even ask for the patent.
I never regretted it.
In this regard, don’t do it if you don’t find a graduate job, try to find something that pays well, or that you like to do.
If I had stayed in graduate jobs, I would still have to pay my student loan.
I don’t like business so much, so I hope in the long run to pass either in the public service or in the university world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I got my degree in 2011 there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of the bison sectors such as art/letters/theater/media/philosophy/political sciences, that is, what are called unemployment diplomas.
I have one of these degrees and I have finished production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not graduation but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course, the starting salary was lower but we quickly climb the ladder because in the real world what matters is results more than knowledge.
This debate on engineering studies/artistic sectors has been going on for years.
Scientists can’t solve all the problems, it’s more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people so as to get results.
Are Letters, Philosophy and Art Biennale Chains?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about degrees like media studies or whatever the absconding industry you've gone to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real chains.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn’t it be better to have a real territorial policy to disenfranchise Paris and energize the rest of France?
Personally, I hardly see the inhabitants of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise valley do 80km round-trip every day by bike to come and work in Paris.
The inhabitants of the inner-wall and the small belt already have many otherwise more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and locked parks, as already exists in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or in Lyon, will be installed on the road.
That's a good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
So much to benefit from their great experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found a place for ONE ONLY bike attachment device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delano<0xC3><0xAB>....
Well, it's not at all.
When we talk to pedestrians and other users of public transport, we talk about pedestrians, we talk about pedestrians, we talk about pedestrians, we talk about pedestrians, we talk about pedestrians, we talk about pedestrians, we talk about pedestrians, we talk about pedestrians, we talk about pedestrians, we talk about pedestrians, we talk about pedestrians, we talk about pedestrians, we talk about pedestrians, we talk about pedestrians about pedestrians, we talk about pedestrians, we talk about the
The cycle paths are of apartheid, it is necessary to cohabit but to rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in Paris?
Not a word on the place of the bike in public transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% of sailing trips is ridiculous.
I'm starting to think Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Moreover, after what OR reports, the EELV assistants seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find who really hides behind this massacre.
Index: This is not Russia.
Not sure how to love the way the world evolves.
That looks horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case to the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint was actually filed.
In addition, they should first file a complaint in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the criminal investigation that would result from it.
Yes, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority responsible for the security of the airspace, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been shot down earlier, Ukraine was launching air strikes against the rebels in the area and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in the face of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents for airlines to pay overflight rights to the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurping government / the ultranationalists of Western Ukraine – and who want to prove in wholesale that Putin shot down the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is going on in their skies.
The previous one: a 1986 ruling by the International Court of Justice that concluded that the CIA’s provision of weapons to the rebel Contra forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will not let this matter go to the ICJ.
It’s funny to think that Abbott means to Putin that Australians were murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can come forward with evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators haven't said anything like that.
My name is Ricardo and being such a beekeeper in eco, it's distressing!
To be called polar is to lose the north is pleasing.
There is only one question: Is the poor of today more poor than the poor of yesterday?
I can’t help but notice that those who criticize Piketty’s book most virulently haven’t read it!
It's easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of income from work, property of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term..
It shows that the concentration of today’s capital reaches that of the beginning of the 20<0xC2><0xB0> before 1914, it shows that it is the two world wars that have reduced the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pamphlet knowing that an individual’s concentration capacity has some limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is fair, one can argue about it without having read the book, the essence of which is to argue in a single sense in favor of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his pavé summarized by the press wrong?
I haven't read it and won't read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is that which seems to me pure fumistry.
The notion of a gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Is not humanity at all enriched?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the award without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope this award will not be a burden for the young girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that the colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
All my wishes for happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighbourhoods of Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn’t where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Isn’t Malala herself one of those “colored perverts”?
You should not have any “antenna time” on this site.
You, yourself, are a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 years old when she was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for her to receive a higher education and that she has the right to decide for herself on her marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she said is that an average Pakistani girl often has to marry at the age of 14, without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it out loud enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Rather disappointed by this entry in regards to season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who visibly has a bit of trouble finding her Marlene Dietrich société character.
I’ve just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit it’s one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and the show by Jessica Lange singing Bowie’s anachronistic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I have not yet watched this new season (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I preferred to have it all at once than to watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is on, apart from the extraordinary Jessica Lange, it’s above all the risks of staging and editing that sit me down.
There is an avalanche of original plans in AHS that does not make a lot of sense of the acceptance of today's productions.
It escapes me a little from seeing you throw the sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality of it.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things yet.
It’s not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside of the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot at her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, she wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don’t see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it’s going to end up like 24 hours of what.
But everyone does what they want!
That’s why I say “I won’t look any further” that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I just share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think she'll be fatal to him.
But after that, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less tax increases, please - coupons rather in state spending.
No, we'll increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to know about spending have failed.
Encouraging disputes about relatively small expenditure posts, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of orientation that voters seem to call their wishes and all this time some, in each camp, make it seem that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see their faith in their game and find them clear.
Less than 1% of expenses.
The “debt” is assets held mainly by financial institutions in this country.
“Debt” is nothing to worry about.
I wouldn't see a problem with the government taking in a third of my income (before even talking about consumption taxes) if I thought it was going to use it wisely.
But that’s not the case, and many taxpayers have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage was not quite honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, the subsidies to wind turbines almost useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should do to get back to you.
Your first <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns <0xC2><0xA3>35,000 a year will pay about <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 would pay around <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 (a fifth), etc., and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 will pay about <0xC2><0xA3>70,000 (a little over a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car vignette, and it is before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car vignette.
I am paid in a decent way, but not in an extravagant way.
Not that it’s a problem, of course, I’m happy to pay my taxes.
But let’s not pretend that money falls from the sky, or that it’s not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes go.
How can an unemployed person who is looking for work at the doorstep prove it?
Even though 20% of the unemployed would not search, that is, 80% search and do not find.
Being unemployed myself, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
Whether a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances.
In fact, I haven't heard from P<0xC3><0xB4>le Emploi in months, which means that agents are more busy with control operations than really getting job ads coming in?
I don't see interest.
Because it is not for the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi doesn't provide enough jobs, then you have to go to Pole Emploi.
What is it about a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that the unemployed do their duties well in exchange for their rights.
Just as a controller requires their transport title to users of a means of transport, a service leader or employees of their work, etc.
Nobody shouts at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I have dealt with P<0xC3><0xB4>le Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been badly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, I had to fight hard.
It takes time!
I am not an expert in law.
The check-in and check-out is currently taking over, while Statutory Employment is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only employees, it is they who pay the costs.
Non-employee politicians and French people have rights that they don’t actually have!
It's not normal.
I should like to add that decent unemployment insurance is involved in the enhancement of wage-earning employment.
More than just waiting for killer tweets in Arabic...
In reality, there must be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop ISIS so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and population movements at the time.
The Saudis have had the spirit to ban the Hajj from Mecca this year to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have seen their visa application refused because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted varicella in Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit.
Is it to be heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane to Europe?
I thought it was just common sense but apparently those “who know” decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be quarantined strictly.
No one's out.
Only health care workers can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were contaminated after having contacts with people in West Africa even though they took “all the necessary precautions.”
We can stop the progress of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let's ban them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be quarantined immediately.
May he pass the message of the first individual and the second (including religious) group and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt he is capable of erecting in dogma the image of God characterized by the totality of the cortexes of the planet in operation.
It's still a long way from that design there.
It’s only been 20 years that information has appeared as humanity’s given prime, while religion, out of the brain, has been directing our actions since Lucy perhaps.
What is the point of becoming a second Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not set foot in the Church anyway, there is only a small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step in removing the notion of sin, too “anxiety”?
<0x40>louise: Sorry the church does not have a limited vision in France.
And in the world, maybe it will touch more people...
<0x40>Martin E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you envisioned it pre-existing with Christ.
Hillel once said, “Do not do to others what you do not want them to do to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is just a comment: go and study!”
Christianity goes well beyond a mere reciprocity but introduces the agape.
Your "promote justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is this a return to communism? :-)
The next step is to remove the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain that hero who has upset moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and advance justice, peace, fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and driven to immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It's not invented.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fundraising campaign) but I don’t think it’s worth <0xC2><0xA3>30.
If it’s the PC version you’re interested in, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount coupon.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount coupon.
I'll watch.
Of course not at work.
The joys of the computer department block all the nice sites.
Hello, is it <0xC2><0xA3>30 then 20% off, or does the <0xC2><0xA3>30 include the 20% off?
Please note, however, that the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Plus, I bought it on Steam, so no refunds, it's zero.
It's time to buy a new video card *make the mouth*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat Emptor and all that: I didn’t use it myself.
Amazon <0xC2><0xA3>30 for PC, <0xC2><0xA3>35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, <0xC2><0xA3>44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll wipe it out of your library if they decide to strangle the people who buy it there while they're out of the planned area.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was France in 1940 a "putrid land"?
So tell me, this Nobel prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Is it necessary to love France of 40, that of the "strange defeated"?
When we see who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature, we wonder if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we don’t even want to read the award-winning authors.
Will Brazilians, Chinese or Australians read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and describes a universe so limited and so self-centered?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture, themselves.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at its fair value, if they don’t already know it!
On your side, continue to attend Lévy and Musso.
I'm sharing your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
So let’s see who won the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.

Greetings to the cowards.
Since I've been driving one in Iceland, I don't stop seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or do you think of me as Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, always hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my medics.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days rest.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to the beer and cider party in Nottingham.
It was brothel.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
On Monday night, we went to a buddy's grandfather's house to play the nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner’s chance I was able to go back with several decent bets.
I hope that if I turn 95, I will be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks arrived with a wide slice of it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to upset you, I think you're moving a bit away from the subject.
This famous totality, it prohibits searches for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
She immediately reports the arms trade.
Either we have big eyes open like Meddeb and Ta<0xC3><0xAF>a or Boubaker we have big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping our eyes closed that we access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you make a monumental counter-sensation: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these official unanimous condemnations.
Those who say no to consent.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoch Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be foolish and in vain to accuse them a priori and demand that they manifest publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
This principle is in my view the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the delirium of French society.
If there is no doubt, so much to say.
Who says no word consents, but consents to what?
Consent to a close relationship with ISIS or to the condemnation of ISIS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to house the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap between their decentralization proposals and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified to lose all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron's got to laugh.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are taking full advantage of Scotland as they have no seats.
They can do whatever they want with all electoral impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut off their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the “PROMESSE” thinking he was saving his party but not realizing that he was signing the death penalty for his Scottish MPs.
Not surprisingly, some Labour MPs are asking for accounts from their leader.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they have tried for maximum.
I think that's the most important thing.
Not if Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected someday in England.
Pumping 8% at the expense of 85% is not a super election strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish MPs are no longer able to vote on the subjects that concern England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster unionists, and it worked well for her.
Still, he is still in a position to be prime minister in 2015 and this since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, in general, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is the “Life of Others” of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the end, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next ticket: Amazon makes YOUR book based on YOUR profile and it automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's as gay as the world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thanks for the article.
As under this system, DRM management is not implemented, I still read pirated files, public domain books or bought from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a mouse.
Given the price I paid for Kobo, it's no regrets.
I am ahuri of the widespread abdication of users in the face of the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your public library, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces, the opening and completion rates of which are likely to be ridiculous.
Finnegans Wake by James Joyce.
<0x40>Thomas: In the Big Data era, data doesn’t really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same bag.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that are, not allowing neither to identify readers nor authors.
But Kobo has all this information, him.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be led by a kindergarten class full of under-acid schizophrenic children.
This is even worse than that if you take into account Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some supporters of Erdogan think that Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn’t want to shoot itself in the foot, unless it wins something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it is actually shooting a bullet in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: “The AP reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad because it would endanger Israel’s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending there a serious warning of retaliation or whether it was simply advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what is really surprising is that today’s Iranian and American diplomatic engagement concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
The reading of Indian Punchline is highly recommended to anyone paying attention to details rather than traditional media-balanced c*neries. The short article you give the link is important and should be read keeping in mind the realistic observations/warnings from 1979.
Who are these “moderates” who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the wicked ISIS?
Pipeline policy pushes the world to the brink, and I would suggest those who refer to non-existent “moderates” to pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in World War III.
“It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
It would take a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Is it "must"?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the least chance of still being alive?
A little late for that, my friend.
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
Especially concerning the Triumvirate of the CUP who planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after World War I by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a stinky place in Central Asia at about the same time, when there was a time when there was a time
What a delirium!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, one seeks in vain contact with the real.
What clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart that beats even in the womb of a carrying mother.
Lesbian couples can be just a child’s desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Hetero-sterile couples as well.
As for the kids!
What a shame to refer to them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay the pension of this lady (?)
The GPA is probably a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
She doesn't date today.
Many women brought and gave birth to children who were not their husbands.
It is still so, we are so made...
The important thing in this regard is that this practice is framed so that the "trade" of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, cosmetics, aren’t they so much the merchandise of the bodies?!
Anachronic Fareunit...
It’s certainly more elegant to make a good one in a faraway country via the internet and Pay Pal than to hang on to its responsibilities and or to avoid the scandal in another century near home without shouting it at that time on all roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done in the name of the church! ...
There are not only Christians and believers who reject these practices.
The fact remains that the exploitation of the bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, this man is passionate about something.
In the late 1970s in the Midlands, I saw this from a distance.
I had to go there during the day because I had no right to go there at night!
But if you loved it and you listen to music - this music today always touches you as much.
I don't know why there's so much disparaging comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who've never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article about football that is waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there has been a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of Northern England culture.
No wonder Paul Mason has taken a good look at the social and political context, he understands things well.
The Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can put an ear on it if you’re in the London area in November: 99psoul will again go through soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought “always the same story”, but here is a small article well written and well thought out.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I'm guessing you're glad you got away from Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.

Whatever the station before Wigan was Ince, 15 min walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the police series George Gently titled Gently Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.

The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
<0x40>Jonathan: Netanyahu is not looking for peace because he wants to continue occupying (by the way, it was also the case with Rabin).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahu and their constituents all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock, and went into the water.
An Israeli had stolen it from him.
The Israeli representative got angry and said, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren’t even there at the time!”
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not lower the guard...
That this displeases the anti-Israelis is evident, it is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I replied, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
This has been the case since the policy was globalized.
Avoid, avoid...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it endures!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What relationship of strength enabled the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a report of strength today!
Do you doubt it?!!!
What’s more, it’s not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian’s journalists seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
A lot of what he says are just pseudo-chomskyste billiards written by no other.
That proves you don’t understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It’s just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes him well, which means it’s a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, maybe truths that we prefer not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloid he actually gives the impression of being a novice populist, but this whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it says just to the people not to vote and rather to the people to vote and the people to vote and to ignore the whole political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles/videos that he posted, it says that the people to vote only to the Labour or the Conservatives to vote
I'm not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active in submitting his applications can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are just gurus who will change their minds if they really risk losing the elections), but it's not unreasonable to see what the answers are.
Its solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people were debating what it really says rather than simply labeling it as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The thing about the vote was completely distorted.
The uselessness of dragging a ballot in a ballot box every 5 years annoys me deeply because my vote doesn’t really count for anything.
I want more referendums, e-voting, direct democracy and members who are accountable locally to their constituents.
In addition, I contest the idea that Russell Brand’s speeches are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and university students from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group under the label “pseudo-chomskyste billiards”.
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that’s what the Guardian could do, what Suzanne does like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the head elevations added to the assembly!
As Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but eventually became one of his fans and invited him on his show, it’s too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but which has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This “threat” reveals to me above all that the intellectual debate has not long been held in the RDVs of History where professional historians have become minorities and where the exchanges of specialists have become impoverished for the benefit of ready-to-think condens type Sciences Po for press records.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take on a guilty person, a scapegoat.
They develop each other’s very rational reasoning, but this rationality is based on these emitting loops that are the key to their thinking.
I believe rather that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This is a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
We solve the problem of relationship with each other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchic, neo-lib and/or/libertarian slope (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing to go to seek state aid for its markets) in the sense of at least state/not at all state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that organizes itself beautifully.
His thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt it does not stand still.
He who says guilty, says elimination, kills, sacrifice.
This is not a position taken against the three intellectuals cited here.
No support from elsewhere.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its then-god, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chouya too soon if you took Foucault’s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology from Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Left poses a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the mechanism of membership in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
To see this cabal orchestrated by researchers in human sciences from the hard left who can’t stand the passing of allegiance to their mantras is quite ridiculous.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellows” that I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You haven't had the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this subject, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember the last time I saw a Chinese man.
In London and they were nice to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same about whites.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them say violently anti-White.
My father is not happy that his eldest daughter goes out with a White.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, the Russians mainly have prejudices against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in occupations and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Ienissei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the opinions of the Australians on the Chinese and Aboriginal peoples.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I don't support the Chinese, while I've met two in my life (including one abroad), didn't keep any bad memories, all the people are worth it and, in fact, those in London were very nice.
Otherwise you don’t remember who you meet, all people are worth it, how to remember who was who.
Do you know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with the white lady.
How many Chinese men are with white men, by comparison?
None, because there is a good chance that the parents of these Whites would physically assault them.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
Yet it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left as the union of the judiciary...
<0x40>Marabout: I'm sorry, but the courts are frankly right-wing.
When the Union of the Magistrates' Union, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made on the basis of the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
That of the political vision of the observer as that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It remains then the obligatory tool of the law to refocus the assessment on the fundamentals.
The measurement of its non-observance in all the judicial acts of judges, including the prosecutor's office, forces to make a distinction between error and the impartiality of judges.
It would be vain to claim that the acts of justice are not distributed among these three groups.
Pretension and ignorance are not subject to objective analysis.
And so if all of this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by statistics that implicitly reveal that it is going from very low.
The previous preamble allows the following to be entered in the third ratio.
The one of the corruption* of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area in question is that of the dispossession* of heirs committed up to the means of fraud to the procedure* by successor genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million in bad years while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the quasi-impunishment* of the French notary.
For the understanding of their mechanism, some of them were reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this is accompanied by such a statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to become spoilers, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all laws favorable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics that ignore this kind of rational criteria an elaborate form of lie?
Prices are definitely prohibitive.
More equipment to scam people with disabilities.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these all-terrain tricycles, custom built to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never before a normal wheelchair, with wheels and bulky tires, couldn't.
As they say, the tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The tank seat looks like an epic.
I don't think the Whill's inventor ever had to clean a dog's crotch on a kennel.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all over the place, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra-long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a longboard hanger.
There are hills here that they would like.
Prices seem actually high, but there are really people who put that kind of price on a bike, so “you see.”
The tricycle all terrain seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor, though.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know very well that we need.
We can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it is just a draft, it is not planned to make it.
I'm CONTENT that the "long distance" wheelchair doesn't get to the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this stuff.
Nearly 20,000 homes have been destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, during intense bombings of densely populated residential neighborhoods.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation as well, since this blockade imposes a “collective punishment” on all civilians in Gaza.
“Entrepreneurs working on their projects divert a little bit of their cement to the black market.”
Oh, it's not wood, it's concrete and the lady's armed...
The references are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There is the black market it is certain, and recognized.
Two million people have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well-kept land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi didn’t have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by who you know) ruled it out!
Don’t forget as well that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I agree...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israeli-Egyptian.
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built against the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Alex.
I hope you've thought about it.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the sharing economy, without profit.
Many are just looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it’s getting paid (or at least hoping for it) in another way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you need to look for the right addresses.
In addition, owners and tenants who trust each other often stop using Airbnb and process directly in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this?
"What does she rent on?"
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The word “to let” is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have good insurance for the boat... make sure it is 100% compliant with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers permission to do a commercial activity there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (I'm sure they will refuse).
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sunk, etc.?
The pennies are so slow that if someone tried to steal it they would always be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates.
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our pennies...
Where are you going to tie him up?
No Marine Le Pen is wrong!
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is on the rise in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase of wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the Mass will be called!
Capitalism is not going to stop!
High finance, speculative, plays with our companies so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, so our food, with the care structures so our health, with our debts so our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obesity of the coin.
On the contrary, FH said, “My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance.”
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed Minister of Economy a former Rothschild banker, a history of better defending the interests of banksters, solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else in the competition?
How do you call it: turn his jacket, lower his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
We don’t really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where'd you see that?
Because the Germans refused to help the survivors.
I’m not sure that Spee really “refused” to help the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book “Castles of Steel” suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was stormy at the beginning of the day; I don’t know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this to the next battle, that of the Malouines, where, in the photos showing the survivors being rescued, you see a calm sea and in full day.
In addition, the rescuers knew that at this stage there were no more German fighters in the area.
Hmm, it doesn’t really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick Wikipedia search:
“There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two armored cruisers, who had disappeared into the dark after they stopped shooting, and a chase began.
Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he approached, he saw that it was only a wreck.
The N<0xC3><0xBC>rnberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, bent and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his headlights on the ship’s flag, the proposal to surrender was rejected and he opened fire, eventually running the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee ruled that Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Worried about reports indicating a British armored man in the vicinity, he headed north.
So, if this is true, the Germans, in the dark before the invention of radar, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have severely damaged them, so in the confusion they plunged to enjoy their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should make a path through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally caught.
Several votes are raised in the UMP to demand that it be included in the law that a permanently convicted elected person be thus permanently ineligible.
This is a bold position, which would also affect left-wing voters well on.
But noon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSED AN INSCRIPTION TO THE WALL OF THE CONS OF THE MAGISTRATS
When is the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by political cards (es) whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always prompt to amuse those who will benefit from their immobility to hinder the actions of real politicians, who are really trying to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobility is to the measure of their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little banners "subs for justice" they came from the province and didn't make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of political unions whose members put the enormous power they hold in the service of their party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing, even far-right trade unions targeted the personalities on its side and led to a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are completely free of charge.
If, at the moment, the right defies the judicial news, it is simply that it has committed facts that are relevant to it!
We do not have an example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with justice but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not had favorable treatment.
On the other hand, it must also be recalled that the left-wing union of the judiciary is not the only union of magistrates and is a minority.
That a minister supports unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
<0x40>MCR The union you are quoting may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at the Chancellery, it is not a secret.
One now wonders if the "mission" of certain judges is no more to go up than to teach.
<0x40>gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
<0x40>Pivoine: You forget that the magistrates are not officials like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and incarcerate everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the weakest starved of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepts their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Direction fill stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, has launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed in Eurovision, as did so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in contests in the United States.
In the 70s and 80s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the British television’s light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that’s what happens to most stars who don’t participate in competitions anyway.
Rarely are those who, after a tube, succeed in making others.
However, most singers/groups can best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
His fame comes partly from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it's more likely to lead a career than the typical way of rock, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitarists who smoke grass in their father's garage and balance three chords on a high school level poem will surely become stars and the only question is whether it's going to be like this.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the studied peoples – distance that turns quite quickly to racism, because sacralist ethnologists present these distant people as infinitely superstitious and petrified of ritual bigotry, while most of our striets are cruel in our ways.
Except that you imprudently interpret in the opposite direction.
Or, rather than saying that the drum is devoid of a sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Moli<0xC3><0xA8>res also do not have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as recalled to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined and circumscribed object in the religious sphere.
Very interesting article, whatever it is.
It's ephemeral deco to furnish the vacuum.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw into the mouths of not at all scientific interpretations that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative review of the disciplines to make one laugh a little?
Because what is true for archaeology is also true for interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of salutary modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, valuable testimonies to reconstitute history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very ancient and earlier archaeologists relied on their “instinct” and knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Nowadays, there are technical and scientific means so powerful that the interpretation of the excavations is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
We are here in the midst of (and old) controversy over shamanism advanced by the prehistoricer Jean Clottes (cf. his book "The Shamans of Prehistory", particularly the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could get into it.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why we can't go on at three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the canyon?
No, but we're not against a play on it.
We couldn’t watch a musical on the other hand, it would be too gay!
We could expect to have this kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse is back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, I can suggest you move on to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
Can I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real journalists, brave, for them to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their risks and dangers.
Instead of getting rich with these childish ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Go on, then.
If these "puerile ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this journal also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
However, we can find the video of the crash on the net...
Video amateur of the crash on the net...?
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the drivers it would have released the safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g., depane) entered the circuit.
But it had to end soon before the typhoon was known to be coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it good to advance the time of departure (right TV, pub, money...).
But apart from that, they protect the pilots well.
Of course, I also share this opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM gets into SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at restart to beat the English that led then...
This blog is dedicated to you, my dear Dayrton.
But it's not serious, I have some time to brush up all your fucking tears.
No, just not.
There have been plenty of F1 conspiracies, but never one that puts commissioners in danger of death for a long history of the possibility of a driver's victory at the expense of another.
It is not the FOM that brings out safety because it is the FIA.
Nuance of size.
In view of the amateur images, the lack of image allows the FIA especially to avoid the annoying questions of the type: How does the commissioner shake a green flag in full intervention and continue to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it’s not because the video is deemed too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because you clearly see one of the commissioners waving a green flag, sign that the race can resume normally and that you are more under yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark mismatch of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under yellow flag regime BEFORE the place of the accident, from which the green flag is agitated.
This is the usual procedure.
The station of commissioners just downstream from the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters as well as 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal look.
Sensationalism is selling advertising.
Before, I thought the media was an integral part of the government’s “patriotic” propaganda offensive, but I’m afraid that, in the end, it’s just for the money.
And sex, let’s not forget sex, the fear of not having sex life, the ads and the media are good for selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The info does exactly the same thing.
Making the buzz with info that you really don’t need to worry about is just to keep scaring people in order to be able to keep control of them.
“When tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch the fear,” it should be “derailing,” not “toughing.”
Given the medical reference, “toasting” is much better said in this context than “derailing”.
I wonder if all the people who are drowning that Ebola could begin to spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist.
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch.
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that beautifully and solidly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh.
It is depressing to me that the media is talking about most things with this optimism in reverse.
The goal is once again to keep us scared and anxious enough (without getting hysterical) so that the government can get us ripped off when it needs to.
I think it makes perfect sense that if we have to suffer a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from the crises that he himself invented.
Is there not something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be still of this world almost 35 years later.
At first it had to be horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I am bluffing, living with the certainty of spending years there....
A perfectly useless testimony.
As always when it comes to science.
Not only do the testimonies serve nothing: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
<0x40>trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps that is why we refrain from asking questions to patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatrist mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (<0x3D> here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) serves nothing in a scientific approach?
So, what do you base your research on?
On ghosts?
Are you at the same level of fanciful theories and facts (<0x3D> giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resiliency": the word canned by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take on great psychologists after reading D'Ansembourg.
<0x40>Jim: There are a lot of meaningless buzzwords in psychiatry.
Cyrulnik struck us with “resilience”.
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he has given us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's *not* a good idea to pop out the Air Sentinels...
So why?
It was a great series and it seems that those who come out of it are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the all-powerful who can do miracles.
But how are they going to make the children hang?
The only solution that comes to my mind is the pipi-caca humor, which would kill the series.
It was already a children’s series.
The children were hanging.
Oh, because it's a children's series?
UKIP works for Mysterons.
Keep your Team America.
Always in Supermarionation?
It won’t be the same if you don’t see the sons and the animation is done well. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (though being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a channel to redistribute the old ones.
The series almost never stopped airing here in Australia; it’s been at least 40 years since we have one-hour episodes on Saturdays and Sundays at 6 a.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and you can always see it at these times.
And in addition, the half-hour episodes now pass at 5:30 a.m., Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a "sad" 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the esplanades!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations below and around the mosque of the esplanades for several decades have not made it possible to find anything.
The Temple Mount, if it exists, is elsewhere.
Could it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not wanted for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of the mosques was built.
Its summit, or Dome of the Rock, stands out in the middle of the Omar Mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it was Mount Moriah, where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
Since it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to remember it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the 2-state plan, and sabotaged it continuously!).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Will God be able to recognize His own?
The shortest of the Jewish jokes: "God be praised!"
To celebrate tourism in Israel, we are often shown young, half-dressed naiads, alluring on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful work of propaganda!
It is a pity that the photographer of Reuters did not take pictures of the hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to enter the Temple Mount and who prefer to trick the Jewish faithful into contraband, praying to the Wall of Grievances.
<0x40>Mat, If this photo bothers you, it’s right, it’s not the newspaper or the photographer, but this woman and the ideology that she conveys that must be condemned.
This system is not tenable and will end up in tears.
The only way to end this system is revolution.
Since the economy seems to have gone bankrupt, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they are lucky enough to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given the small elite ever greater pay at the top.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in this country when the workers will really speak with one voice.
Instead of squeezing and groaning when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike not only concerns their problems, but also shows your employer that we don’t tire people with impunity.
Unless democracy is abandoned, in which case it is tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you’ve forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
This can't all end well.
It's because we're in a democracy that it has held.
Did you vote for the PTI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
That sounds incredible, but that’s exactly what the Investor-State Dispute Resolution Mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people about the unimaginable damage this agreement will have on our lives.
It’s only recently that we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you’ll understand what’s being negotiated in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
These are the ones that make excellent returns, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the car market.
This gentleman is right, in the XVIII there were unions in all regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (at last, her officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe herself to be the safe of the eternal values of France, and she will fight and close her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of a nation, having this small relic, it is comforting.
Even though for her, it's increasingly uncomfortable...
You're still missing the union of married men, celibates, married women, celibates, lost dogs and I don't know what else
If you don't write French correctly, I'm a unionist.
You have been warned, it will be your fault.
For the defence of categorical interests, protected professions with trade unions have already suffered quite a bit, which has created a rupture of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of risk on the part of an official.
One can very well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in exchange for the protection they enjoy.
If not, it's an insured disaster.
And with the carts getting ready, the government congratulates them.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject commented here...
Let us delete "through his delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in the management of enterprises.”
This is absolutely essential with the break-up of the information power.
And yet you have opened, probably read and commented on an article specifically titled “The Great British Bake Off review”. ??????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I've been watching, and I can tell you that some have been well-seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (although misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the pie mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a victory for the worst baker; no one has ever done the kind of "boom, here's my fucking cake now sip it and bow down before your master"!
Perhaps the extra pressure from friends and parents outside has finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept at a distance.
And there’s also this idea of “playing security, there’s always next week” that goes away last week.
I like to cook, but I don’t think I can handle it.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us a great entertainment and push us to try new things.
Back to GBBO 2015!
I agree, the last challenge of last year, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to brush one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to leave, I don’t know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the base a little dry (although I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice on Richard’s mill didn’t give up, anyway Richard had already lost at that point).
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a bit artificial because of the time given.
There is also the cancer that leaks, with solar wind blows.
Clearly, everything succeeds at the moment.
A bad time to spend with humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are mainly blocked by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn’t be enough solar wind to “hunt” the ozone from the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and “cancers”.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block the UV.
They have a lot of useful features that you don’t suspect.
If we limit ourselves to man they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks cancerous UVCs and lets pass UVAs and most UVBs.
Do you know that you don’t have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a stay-at-home when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was implied in the comment, which itself intends to demonstrate pedagogy.
Not to mention that I'm a melanoma addict, UVs just make it EMPLOY its development.
They do not challenge it.
For proof: not all bronzed people necessarily have melanomas.
Or, when a toubib tells you that you need to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it’s better not to listen because UVs are necessary for every human being.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Is it possible to fold it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it on to the mixer?
or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that anything can be folded if enough force is applied to it and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use it is intended for.
I think the army would need something more resilient and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as front-line communication equipment.
But for the rest of us,
That's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have established that anything can be folded if a sufficient force is applied to it
Except for the Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke about folding that I read in the comments today.
It is difficult to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production line and we can hardly see how it could get back there.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm..................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which iOS has not been installed properly and which is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don’t know how they do these things.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of the FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
This article is about bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that industrials produce in « industrials' We put forward super u but all the signs and meme the small trade are concerned How to bouffer bon, bio avac 1650<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> (average salary in French)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After everyone is free to put his priorities where he hears them.
For me, food is one.
Don't worry, I'll kiss you
People who see the world through ideological “software” are called “bobos,” or rather “boboécolos,” who lead them to disconnect from reality.
This is the total disintegration of thought-reason.
They are experts in gestures, for example claiming to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in truffles, joining the left-caviar, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not tolerate this mixture of heavy ideology and truffles, nor do you be surprised to often meet critics about them.
Wow, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theorization as well as for all the associated details (airplane, shower...).
I'd love to be a part of it, but I can't find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboécolos are monobloc.
Do you understand the concept of the left caviar?
And well you are able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
This is the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in eco-friendly shorts.
The boboécolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of the ecolos because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look that giraffe in the face.
It is so badly done that it looks vaguely like a female nude.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment since you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flaunting great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous with no artistic ability.
That's *art*.
No, it's a pig.
The fact that Emin does not know how to draw
This is not really a proven fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate are realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke while playing billiards.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real thing.
If you’re just looking for that, a camera will do the job.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it’s so easy, why don’t you do it yourself?
There are still savings to be made: horseback riding, the number of Republican guard horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service.
L(honesty obliges to say that France is decreasing its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, to start with Britain.
It's only half-encouraging...
The operative without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, at a time when we observe the weaknesses, the inadequacies of our defense tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local communities concerned, who are losing a dimension of their activities, or even a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctification?
<0x40>edmond: that’s what I was saying, look elsewhere where to make savings but especially not at my house, at my house it’s really not possible...
That’s exactly what you’re proposing to do, look elsewhere where the gagegie is certain.
May all those who have sided with little or enough the military thing dare to come and say here, eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted within this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
Applying the same potion to the entire public service and public finances will get a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministries and you will understand why La Défense can feel a bit charged!
Well, yes, the savings that everyone agrees to say we have to make them, but it has to be seen somewhere, doesn't it?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls will succumb to murder when it happens to them, the poor darlings.
I should do it, but most of all, I don't want it to fall on me because, in this case, it's a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Grace Valley weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local communities, history repeats itself at every post-closure, maternity, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for the savings, of course.
It is strange, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and does not rejoice in the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the coolest thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It’s depressing to scroll through his Facebook thread and see that 80% of his friends started their status with the phrase “This embarrassing moment.”
I think they're going to make a movie.
It will surely be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex in the bus going to work and realizes only there that his skirt has returned to his ass.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely me.
Not really, in my opinion, the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to bury his emotions and tighten his teeth.
I’m sure if you’re a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence has been something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don’t have the “Internet”.
So I don't think I can comment.
They don't have a computer.
God, I have to watch this movie before I die.
I can't believe how much this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has really just demonstrated that he is at the very top of the cosmic universe which is satirical journalism!
I'm falling in the opposite direction!
I absolutely need to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the lighting and discover the incredible brilliance and insurmountable genius that springs from Mr. Brooker’s keyboard like a divine glow.
Oh, my God, it was really nothing.
Especially if they are not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive evolution within democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Up to a new order we are confiscating the right to save our planet by states that play the truffles at every meeting to save the planet.
So we, as citizens, decide to take matters into our own hands.
With the commissioner they planted to energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away....
Translation: Windmills and solar farms are the Round Points of Tomorrow.
All financed by the con-tributor.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the industry is not fully mastered, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Electricity by the renewable to combat CO2 emissions? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for the other steps.
Electricity from the renewable wind or PV is already more GHG on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittentness.
Replacing the nuclear with renewable wind or PV would go against the fight against CO2.
Christial I don't insult you I'm a Doctor of State in Physical Sciences 1981 plus I've done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove lez contrary to what I said.
For what I did not say is you who lend me ideas I did not say anything about Germany in fact you did not respond to what I said and like all the right-wing people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is a non-profitable and ineffective means of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you don't count uranium extraction and construction and if you don't count greenhouse gas water vapor of less effect than Co2 it's true recall two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant goes into steam and a little into the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a “Giant of South Asia”...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
It is not surprising to me that most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India the giant of South Asia...
I don’t mind the fact that some Pakistani players are participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandora’s box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, Kolkata's Athletics coming 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India devotes to IPL cricket and now football, how could we one day compete with our “noisy neighbors”...
The race to the low cost launcher is paid cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible lack of design manifests itself only with a helium too cold.
So we may not be in a design defect, but implementation...
Unlike arianespace which is a private company, it seems though that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay the satellites in frigates who know..
This is all the more annoying as many media resume the only headlines of articles – and that many readers retain only those headlines.
In total, this creates a false impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Quite agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project while it is just a launcher issue.
