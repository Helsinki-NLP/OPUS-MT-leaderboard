Members of the Welsh Assembly concerned about "identifying them as Muppets"
Several members of the assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposal to amend their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has been rooted in the plan to change the name of the assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may become a laughing stock.
A member of the Labour party’s assembly said he was concerned that MWP would “marry with Twp or Pwp.”
For readers who are not Welsh: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly has commented that his party as a whole "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a Welsh conservative member has claimed that his group was "open" to the name change, but also commented that there is a too small difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
According to the committee of the assembly responsible for preparing the legal draft to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualification to appoint the members of the assembly will, of course, fall within the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee was decided by "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WPM", the option of "MWP" was the one that received wider support in the public consultation.
Apparently, the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives. However, the attempt to reach a consensus may be a complete curse for the President of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in question for weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly shall hold the final vote on their denomination during the debate related to the legislation.
The Macedonian people will vote in a referendum to change the name of their country
Citizens will choose on Sunday whether or not they want to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a dispute that lasted decades with neighbouring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has insisted for a long time that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way to claim its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country’s attempts to form part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, in opposition to the plebiscite on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, those who are in favour, like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev now, think that the name change is simply the price that must be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells stop ringing: the difficulties of Harlem churches
“Historically, the big people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
"Today, there is no one left, neither of them."
According to Adams, the disappearance of bars can be understood.
“People have a different way of socializing today,” he says.
“Bars have already ceased to be that kind of living room for the neighborhood where people used to go regularly.”
As for the churches, he worries that the money earned from the sale of assets will not last as long as their leaders predict "and that sooner or later they will return to where they left off."
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the type of people who will not be of any help for the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be of a white race,” he says, “and therefore what they will do will be to speed up the closure of all churches, since it is quite unlikely that most people will move towards these condominiums.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that had originally left during the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation acquired ownership of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street retail merchants, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they charged the rail.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's Church, proudly described the rail as "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who made the track sound in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first track to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who had to move to the Riverside Church's largest track 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has sounded at St. Martin's in recent months, on the other hand, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them carried by the church's lay leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing concern that the diocese "pretends to pass on the costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A bull injures a 13-year-old boy while searching for lice in California
A bull attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on KSWB-TV in San Diego, he was spending half an hour kissing with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the cries of a boy asking for help. Then they rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get him out of the water.
Hammel says that it was first thought that it was a joy to have taken a lobster, but then he "realized that he was shouting 'They've been biting me!'
I've been bitten!"
He had all the clavicle ripped off," Hammel observed when he reached the boy.
“Because everyone came out of the water, I shouted, ‘There’s a bull in the water!’” Hammel adds.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
It is not known what kind of bull is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles commented that he worked for a few weeks to detect a bull in the area, but that it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
Authorities shut down access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablanca for 48 hours to Swami's in Ecinitas for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of bull in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans, towards the UK beauty products market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty product aisles in the style of large warehouses occupied with specialized employees.
These big passes are only a part of a considerable investment in the UK beauty products market, a market that moves about <0xC2><0xA3>2800 million and which continues to grow while the fashion and home products sectors are left behind, and will be tested in 11 stores across the country to expand their sales.
The investment in beauty products is a product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space in their catering that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3,000 different products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space with areas of similar brands that can be found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the relaunch phase of its range of boutique makeup products so that most of the products are now suitable for vegans, an aspect increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
The Fragrance Shop retail chain will also open concessions to two Sainsbury's stores. The first did so last week in Croydon, south London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and switching to a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has made big supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, the stores will increasingly resemble large warehouses in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight off discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos sales points to many of its supermarkets, as well as a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, he comments, has served to relaunch retail sales and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy product departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's made a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended abruptly by not agreeing on how to divide the profits of the pharmacy chain into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
According to Sainsbury’s, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury brands of skin products, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, comments: "We have transformed the look of our beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have invested in specially trained workers who will be of great help in providing advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and that we challenge the traditional way of making purchases.”
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby backs a deal of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
The Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "crazy" after television presenter Holly Willoughby made a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time to devote himself to the joint business of home products and Truly accessories.
The business of these two media characters had come to compare with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' star Den Peter Jones furious at retiring at the last minute of the lucrative lifestyle brand joint venture to focus on her new own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also bring her great profits.
According to various sources, Jones was "crazy" when the red TV star admitted, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at his empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the presenter's new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million deal would no longer have enough time to sell the product.
The business had come to compare with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane toward one of his holiday residences outside the UK.
According to one source: "Trily was by far Holly's top priority.
It was meant to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to back down left without words all the parties involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to the launch...
Right now there’s a warehouse full of merchandise at its Marlow headquarters just about to be sold.”
According to experts, the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the UK’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment it had made in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and the possibility of delays.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined it as president last March.
Both couples spend the holidays together. In addition, Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said: “We will not comment on your business.”
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider "not a president's own" and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, making fun of a newscaster’s tone of voice:
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first held in Singapore in June was declared as a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations towards denuclearization are stagnant.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho commented on Saturday to the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "response in correspondence" by the United States to its first disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump’s point of view, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we have this great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: ending missile tests, helping to free hostages and returning home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded precinct, we’d have about 200,” Trump said, noting the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds of deaths due to a tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations from other countries were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is very demanding," Ms. Sumbang said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not safe even if foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, commented that Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies were allowed to contribute to the provision of assistance.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia suffers, the country remains unfortunately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although Aceh has built shelters in the event of a tsunami, they are not frequent on other coasts.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, although there was a warning in force, is very likely to have contributed to the number of deaths.
Moving between the huge number of islands in Indonesia is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake is now heading for Palu; however, it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as the central element of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia’s poor infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money on roads and railways.
However, Joko's government faces next year's re-election laden with funding deficits.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a faith that is at least more conservative.
More than 1,000 dead and tens of thousands of displaced are the result of fighting on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs with axes, bows and arrows, and other bloody weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scored the goal of the match with a long-distance tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with his goal scored in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters from Chelsea goalkeeper when his team was going to lose 1-0.
He settled the ball to the left before letting go an incredible junta headed to the second pole.
The shot crossed the entire area with a high elevation as it was propelling towards the right side of the gate.
The pilot finally started the descent over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in full jump to try to stop it and ended up at the bottom of the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position so I could shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it all the way forward, so I tried to create as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kanté coming, I made a touch and I didn’t think much about it, I just dedicated myself to teaching.”
Chelsea won 1-0 on the break after scoring a goal in the 25th minute with their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the game, the forward of the Blue team scored a pass to Mateo Kovacic before starting from almost half the field and sprinting towards the Liverpool field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from midfield.
He then made a magnificent in-depth pass, which left Hazard within the area with the ball under control.
Hazard overtook the defence to finish in the second half with a left-handed jute where Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League next Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea, for their part, will play with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from Indonesia's tsunami reaches 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped between the rune of the collapsed buildings due to the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that took place on Friday and caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The town of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the ruins of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man as suspected of murder after finding a stabbed woman
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with several stabbings at Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
The police have asked residents of the area to have seen or felt something related to the crime that is being presented to the authorities.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "While the investigation is still in a preliminary phase, I would like to make a call to anyone who is close to John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious, who puts himself in contact with us.
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to pick up anything through the car’s on-board camera, who contact themselves, as they could have vital information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body they found was from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have come to the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As the investigation continues, police have commented that they are informing relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have informed him that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are being warned that hours will pass until they can re-enter.
He could feel like a police officer explaining to a man that the whole area is treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene crying.
Don’t just say, “It’s terrible!”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the fenced area with another van parked outside.
A number of agents remained within the contiguous area controlling the block of flats.
Anyone is asked to have information to send a message directly to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 and mentioning the file 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of the British Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewriting history"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the purest-style destruction of the Taliban of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: "In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main objectives.
The iconoclast of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor that he did during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than not now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his obviously case of the monarchy.
Whether or not this fact constitutes a fully accurate representation remains a subject of historical debate.
What is true is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.
A pig killed by a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, local sources say.
The man, identified solely by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a carved artery and covered in blood near a pig farm in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a court in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As is known, he had traveled Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door that gave to a neighboring pig court.
According to him, in the court there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg calf had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin had his legs broken and full of blood," said the cousin, nicknamed "Wu", according to the news of Guiyang's evening.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not the property of either Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the evening's news that the pig remained closed and isolated in order to avoid attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene of the crime.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although very rare, there have been cases of pigs that attack humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at his Massachusetts farm, and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig of nearly 300 kg grabbed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to scare the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC news that the pigs are usually not aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
“They like to play.
They're like kids, they're very curious... they don't have the idea of doing anything wrong.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will carry torrential rains across the southwestern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the Rosa will carry torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
The Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, owning a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 am Sunday morning, east of the U.S., and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving in an easterly direction to the west coast of the United States. When the Rose approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to drop into the northerly ridge.
The Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Meanwhile, tropical humidity will interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rains across the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, the 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous rivers, streams of waste and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain from 50 to 100 mm in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is a possibility that rivers will form, as the situation is worsening very quickly due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is totally discouraged to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrolled rivers. In addition, storms can carry wind gusts and dust clouds at specific points.
The impending depression will bring torrential rains to certain points off the southern coast of California.
It is possible to record total rainfall above 50 mm, which could lead to lower waste streams and slippery roads.
It would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Insulated, tropical rain clouds will begin to arrive in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday night and Tuesday.
The torrential rains will run into the region of the Four cantons on Tuesday and will continue throughout Wednesday.
October will see several significant temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain strongly warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic changes in temperature in a short distance.
The central U.S. region on Sunday is a clear example of drastic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
The month of October is expected to begin with heat in much of the central and eastern U.S. zone, with temperatures around 27 degrees from the South Plane zone to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would represent about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there are many possibilities for temperatures to be recorded above average in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Brett Kavanaugh's statement
More than 20 million spectators saw Thursday the thrilling testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The testimony was relayed to six television networks.
Meanwhile, political impasse continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular Friday programming due to a turn of events at the last minute: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford explained to the Senate Committee on Judicial Affairs that he was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh played her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a party at the institute.
Kavanaugh, in an uplifting testimony, claimed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers are likely to have seen this witness on Friday.
The company had an average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience figures were not immediately available for other chains that relayed the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble calculating the people who see it from his office.
Set in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football playoff game or that of the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the most audienceed network, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day testimony, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
Interest is held high after the testimony.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying they would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake was picked up by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while being assaulted by protesters as he tried to climb an elevator to go to a Judiciary Committee view.
Flake stayed for several minutes with the view down while he was retweeted live on CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
They said to him, 'You have power, while there are so many women who do not have it.'
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, commented that he would have more to say in the committee's view.
Within a few hours, all the cable and broadcast chains were already broadcasting live at the time when the Judicial Affairs Committee had to vote whether or not to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate to put him to the vote.
Flake, on the other hand, said he would only do so by understanding that the FBI would investigate allegations against the nominee next week, a condition demanded by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations he held with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake had influence, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with the UK's future and to undermine national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party congress in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the cover of the newspaper, former May Boris Johnson's foreign affairs minister reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, where he states that the proposal that the UK and the EU recapture each other's taxes is "absolutely absurd".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrested suspected Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU team player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who was a member of the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison for second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the scene of the crime and say they found Simpson's DNA in them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted that Wayde had died of a gunshot, according to police.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge district forensics office released a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head towards the neck.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Refugee Task Force, the state police forensics lab, the Southern University Police Department, and the residents of the area for the assistance they have provided in the investigation that has culminated in this arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the local law enforcement for their "dignity and to seek justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He averaged 1.98 m, played for a walk and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to leave last season.
On Friday morning, LSU team basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "destrosed" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong one".
“Things like this are the ones that make you suffer all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano erupts in Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday that they would stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The centre was monitoring several recent tremors and tremors.
Images on social networks where a thin layer of ash is appreciated in the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in volcanic activity located 72 km southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the referendum on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after protesters in favor of independence clashed with anti-vaccinated police and thousands of people joined in counter-protests to commemorate the first anniversary of the vote that took place in Catalonia over its secession.
A group of independent individuals detained by the anti-vaccine police began to throw eggs and powder paint, causing dark clouds of dust to appear on the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later that day, clashes broke out with the police, who used their spears to contain violent protesters.
For several hours, independent groups chanted “Don’t forget, don’t forgive” face-to-face with Unionist protesters shouting “Long Life in Spain”.
Fourteen people had to be hospitalized for minor injuries suffered during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not diminished in this region of independenceist mentality a year after an October 1 referendum was held that was considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by an overwhelming majority, although the participation rate was low, as the opposition to the secession boycotted the vote for the majority.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote by entering electoral colleges across the region, causing violent clashes.
Independent groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration took place as well, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narc<0xC3><0xAD>s Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence demonstration along with his wife, said that he no longer had any hopes about the possibilities that Catalonia could achieve independence.
Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, although little margin, in the autonomous elections last December, the Catalan Independentist parties have suffered to maintain the momentum this year, since many of their main leaders are in a self-imposed exile or incarcerated exile waiting to be tried.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the police support demonstration with her phone, and claims that the conflict has been fuelled by politicians on both sides.
“Tension is only increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders imprisoned before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Presenting yourself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the backlash in democratic values and the repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after dressing up a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage to the doors and the building was caused.
It is also possible that, at some point, someone shot a bullet at the car.
Menga's play gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston was a victory.
Livingston, who this year had risen to the top, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in what was just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as head coach of the Ibrox neighborhood club.
Dolly Menga's play made the difference, as with this victory, Gary Holt's team can take second place, which they share with the Hibernian.
Gerrard's, on the other hand, continue without winning outside the Premiership this season. Next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they separate an eight-point difference.
But before that, the Rangers will receive the Vienna Rapid in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends his invincible streak to six games in the league, with a Holt as coach who still does not know what defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in front of the direct game of visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the scoreboard long before the goal, as his direct game caused all kinds of problems in the Rangers.
Scott Robinson opened his way between the defences, but he wasted his opportunity when he was in front of the gate, and then Alan Lithgow sent the ball out as he stretched to try to finish Craig Halkett's past, which crossed the gate.
The locals were already well advised to let the Rangers approach their area, as they knew they could put visitors in trouble in isolated games.
That’s how this goal came about.
The referee scored a foul against the Rangers' interests and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could play first and finish from the central part of the area.
By that time, the Rangers had dominated the possession, but found themselves with impenetrable defense and a goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the game.
The stage was repeated in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a stoppage of merit.
For his part, Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped with his feet on one occasion from Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up deflecting another Livingston combination play.
The Rangers devoted themselves to hanging once and another pilot in the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, two penalties were claimed, one for an alleged entry by Halkett to substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for hands. Both were dismissed.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
One man believes that they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations in this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have hardly changed since his return to the top category, although much of the merit has to be attributed to Holt in the way the team has galvanized since his arrival.
There was a good line of heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, headed by a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be pendent of Menga throughout the match.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments shown with Gerrard as a coach, they have definitely not been able to maintain the level.
They didn’t know how to create opportunities (only once they clearly overcame the local defense), and this the Rangers, which is in the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Adorable reception for Erdogan in Cologne
All were smiling and clear skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Erdogan, however, moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
Police allege security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered around it to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
Both manifestations reflect the division of views around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titular dictator by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies in collision with a car
A cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a heavily trafficked area of Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedics serviced the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in a run-off at Childers Street, a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
Metropolitan police say their agents are working to identify the man and report the facts to the closest family members.
The street has been cut and deviations have been applied to the bus routes. In addition, drivers who avoid the area have been advised.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in altercat
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at this high-security men's detention centre, according to the center's office.
The events occurred in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 9:30 a.m. Sunday, local time, and still last.
Specialized "turned" agents moved to the scene to put an end to the altercation, in which eight inmates were involved. The bailout could be contained by a band.
The officers had to be alerted for slight injuries to the face instead of the facts.
According to a spokesman for the prison service: "We have deployed prison personnel specially trained to try to resolve an incident produced in Long Martin prison, which still persists.
Six employees had to be treated with injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. We are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to be held accountable to the police and may have to spend even more time in the garjola.”
There are more than 500 inmates in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was learned that the head of the prison had to be taken care of in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October of last year, anti-valuable agents took note of the presence in the prison to solve a serious altercation in which the center's personnel were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major storms (zones with drought could benefit)
It’s not uncommon for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week when what’s left of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, with the consequent risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for storms for Monday and Tuesday west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday and is expected to arrive on Monday night with rain.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix commented in a poll that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression at a radius of 322 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) remained 64 km from the border with Arizona.
The most recent models of the national hurricane center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated points where they would register up to 150 mm in the Mogollon of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Conca, could register from 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points of up to 100 mm.
For areas that are out of risk of flooding, the Rosa rain could become very good news, as the region suffers a severe drought.
Although the riverbeds are a serious cause for concern, some of the precipitations could be very beneficial, as the southwest region currently suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Secrecy Control Service, more than 40% of the state of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second-highest category, weather.com reports.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding cooler waters in the Pacific, which is causing it to lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to hit land in Mexico with a strong tropical storm in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "total rainfall is expected from 75 to 150 mm from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm."
After that, the Rosa will head north crossing Mexico with a tropical storm force, before arriving at the Arizona border early Tuesday morning with a tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and arrive at the southern Utah night well inlet.
“The main risk we expect from the Rosa or what’s left of it is very strong rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwestern U.S. desert,” according to the National Hurricane Center.
The rains are expected to cause dangerous rivers and streams of waste in the deserts, beloved by landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found with injuries at Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace area around 4:00 a.m. local time.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he found himself "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the following day in the Radstock area, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
Agents have made a call so that anyone who can have some kind of fact-recording with their mobile phone will be contacted.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has suffered the masculinity and anger" of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to reject the ruthless and outraged tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in an election act in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffering the masculinity and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh declared before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexually abusing her decades ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also stated at the sight in relation to his ally.
The president said on Saturday that on that day, "the American people saw the genius, the human quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
“The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the most brilliant minds in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an admirable track record of service to the citizenry,” he said.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment as talking about the importance of the Republican voter turnout index in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not running, but I actually am,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for our great candidates.”
Trump has argued that Democrats are dedicated to “resisting and obstructing.”
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place as late as Friday, an assistant to the Republican party's leaders told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where the number of victims continues to grow
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged away by the giant waves crashing against the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that has affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday on the occasion of a festival celebrated on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast towards sunset, dragging many of the people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately. That's why they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it destroyed everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved by open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There are people who got up from a tree fleeing the tsunami and were able to survive, he said.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency where the amount of shops and buildings destroyed, turned and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water is appreciated.
The replicas continued to sack this coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical features of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he said, were found trapped between the rubble of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
According to Nugroho, deaths and damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and therefore no information was received" from Donggala, Nugroho says.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, which unfortunately could end up much worse,” he said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves arrived during the time the alert was issued.
In a recording of a fan shared on social media, you can feel like a man on the upper floor of a building giving desperate cries of warning to the street people about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water burst out on the edge of the sea, taking away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut in electricity supply that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Although the army has begun to send humanitarian aid on cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, the evacuees are still desperately in need of food, as well as other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is above 800.
The situation is very serious.
Although World Vision workers in Donggala were able to arrive safely and save money in the city of Palu, where employees flocked to canvas shelters installed in the yard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It is a catastrophe.
Although the aid groups made the desolating gesture of starting the relief tasks, some people complained that it was preventing humanitarian workers from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, provisions and staffing of foreign personnel can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says ‘well, it’s a national disaster,’ we can start asking for international assistance, but this level has not yet been declared.”
While mourning the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami that took place on Friday, the friends and family of the missing people maintained the hope that the miracle would occur and their loved ones avoided the devastating story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was rescued trapped in a keyhole.
On Sunday, rescue teams released a woman who had been buried under the rune for two days with her mother’s body next door.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the paragliding missing for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, there were his students.
“As a senior in the paraglider field, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel between the para-pentista community, he had desperately sent messages by WhatsApp to the competitors in Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a blue double mark.
“I think that means the messages were not received,” he added.
A Thief Takes $26,750 During the Filling of an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport police department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy indicated in the statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to distribute more money.
While he was doing his job, another man "went running behind Brink's employee" and stole from him a bag of money for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: “Being formally known as Kanye West.”
For some time now, West, 41, nicknamed him Ye, used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to present his new album, titled Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons", according to the show's author.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think you’re the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you,” West said earlier this year as he spoke about the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us.
I've gone from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye, which is a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusing part, everything.
The album is a reflection of what we are.”
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known by several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, West's former collaborator, has earned his nickname with or without script and in majors.
Mexico’s president, AMLO, promises not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s president-elect, Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, has promised never to use military force against civilians, when little is needed for the country to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday in the square of Tlatelolco that "the military force would never again be used to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the deaths of 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were sweeping across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, who has committed to supporting young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He said that the lack of education and the lack of opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funds allocated to AI
“While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money it devotes to research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional specializing in artificial intelligence who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government have announced measures on AI, despite the country’s general lack of formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the world’s No. 1 for AI innovation in 2030.
“Duplicating the budget for AI research would be a good start, as the rest of the countries are far behind the U.S. and we want to be the pioneers of the next advancements in the field of AI,” Lee said.
“Duplicating funding could double the opportunities for the U.S. to address the next major AI discovery,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book titled AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s leading AI companies.
In 1980, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that surpassed the American Othello player with the best ranking and subsequently served as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee positively valued previous U.S. government technological competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify the next visionaries.
“Often, American researchers have to work hard to get public scholarships,” Lee said.
According to Lee, “it’s not China that takes away academic leaders; it’s companies.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university eminences to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that the U.S. job in the field of AI could also be boosted by changes in immigration policy.
“I think permanent residency cards should be automatically offered to PhD students in AI,” he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
“The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China grants funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Sciences Foundation and other U.S. public bodies give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than that of academic work.”
At the beginning of the year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve industry and academic institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently spends more than USD 100 million a year on AI research.
In the meantime, no measures have been implemented in relation to U.S. legislation that was intended to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide if they will change the name of the country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on the change of name to the "Northern Republic of Macedonia", a measure that would resolve a dispute that had existed for decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim of its territory and has banned it from entering NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not take part in the referendum, and a boycott campaign casts doubt as to whether it will reach the minimum required participation of 50% for the referendum to be valid.
The question indicated in the referendum paper is: “Are you in favor of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve Macedonia's accession, one of the countries that was created after the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely in the European Union, because it means that we will all have a safer life,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have indicated that they will adhere to the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that there had been no irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared with 34% recorded in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
“I’ve come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” Gjose Tanevski, 62, told reporters in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum held in Macedonia on the country's name change, which would open the way for him to join the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents installed by the people boycotting the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads high, not the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has a stopover rate of more than 20%.
“I think the vast majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said before filing his paper.
Zaev declared that a “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum necessary participation.
According to the results of another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV channel Telma TV, 57% of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% said they would vote “yes.”
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first time the pro-Western government's policy has failed since it took office in May last year.
Watch the video: Manchester City's Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero makes a goal after relegating all of Brighton's defense
Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero and Raheem Sterling canceled Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win over Manchester City in the match played at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England last Saturday.
Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero scored a goal in the 65th minute in a game that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He went at speed between three Brighton defences, rattling his way through the pitch.
Then, Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He relegated a defense before overcoming a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left that he found Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, in Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero, which with his right leg hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, with a jute that stuck into the net on the right side.
“Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero has trouble on his feet,” Pep Guardiola, the city’s coach, told reporters.
“We decided to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky to have scored a goal at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League fight.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero received the ball in depth at the Brighton and
He made a beautiful pass into space for the left band towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before moving it to Sterling in the long lap.
The Sky Blues forward finished the ball inside the net before coming out of the background line.
City will face Hoffenheim on Tuesday in the Champions League group stage at 18:55 at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the fight for the playoffs, there were no clear reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to come out on the pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who hold an advantage game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League, have a chance to play the playoffs.
The Rockies secured a 5–2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play at all, at least we can get out there knowing the environment here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably be playing every point at the highest level, like no one has done this year.
“Why would I want to lose this game?”
The Nationals have yet to announce an open-ended launcher for Sunday, but are apparently determined to let Scherzer launch if this situation is given.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, held a heating session Thursday and would launch Sunday, on his usual day of rest.
Washington's right-wing pitcher has an 18-7 record, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 eliminations per strike in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the great, great.. I do not introduce myself, but in reality I do introduce myself. That is why I am everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates”, he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats is happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all necessary means, they see their malice, their evil intention.
They don’t care who they hurt, over who they have to go through to get power and control. That’s what they want: power and control. But we won’t give them.”
The Democrats’ mission, he said, is to “resist and obstruct.”
"And this can be seen in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "innocent, mean, crude and false."
Trump cited Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, as provoking a strong public outcry.
“Do you remember your answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
Wait a minute... That was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a party.
It is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When my local party’s Momentum activists voted to censor me, it didn’t surprise me.
After all, I am the last of a series of British parliamentarians to whom we have been told that we are not welcome, all to say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he showed up with determination against anti-Semitism.
In my case, with the censorship motion, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the notice of the Friday meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party it was announced that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings held on Friday night have been exactly like that.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and it has long since forgotten the promise of “more generous and kind” policies, if it ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged based on whether it is acceptable for the party’s leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision hoped that I would turn 180 and take positions he would never have taken, either on national security or on the EU’s single market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made because my candidacy is not renewed, central policies are denounced and I am told that it should not be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the messages I receive are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who every day have to deal with a torrent of sexist and racist attacks, and do not run out.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every motion of “no confidence” or every change in the rules of selection, the party was more ahead of the curve.
In the last two years I have received a lot of advice and have been advised to keep my head down, that it was not so expressive and “everything would be fine”.
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my time as a student, stimulated by Thatcher’s neglectful government, which left my entire class literally sunk, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, both as locals and as cons.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would tell them that at a time when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, the message I want to convey is not directed towards Nottingham Momentum, but towards my constituents, whether they be Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of no renewal of my candidacy or no political interest will prevent you from acting, depending on your interests

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: some unbeaten Ayrs lead the leadership
Two last-minute attempts distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved victory in this vibrant match of the Tennent's Premiership day.
The Ayrs, who are the only unbeaten team of the ten, occupy the first position in the standings.
In the end, the local team was imposed thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they knew how to better take advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be satisfied.
“The games we have played so far have put us to the test and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said: “Congratulations to the Ayr people, they have taken advantage of the opportunities better than we do.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, ceded to the Warriors' game, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot did not convert to a try.
Climo extended the Ayr advantage with a penalty and, just in the middle, scored and converted an attempt to put the 17-5 mark in favour of the Ayrs at rest.
But the Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
The match was then interrupted for a long time due to the severe injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who retired in literate, and at the Ayr Dam they again extended the distance with a trial by Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
Then, Deputy Captain Blair Macpherson was alerted with a yellow card and, again, the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of one more man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine trial at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted, and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a score at Climo without a ball, from the penalty lineup, MacPherson scored a counter-trial behind the Ayr's penetrating mole.
Climo scored, as he had done almost again since the dam, after Kyle Rowe picked up a David Armstrong judg and passed the ball on the third line to Gregor Henry to score the fifth try of the local team.
The star of the Still Game series seems to be about to start a new career in the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, seems to be on track to move into the hospitality industry, after it has been discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and co-starred with Greg Hemphill, his long-time comedic partner.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a source in The Scottish Sun reported that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "floating restoration sector."
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, without coastline, hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The Marines patrol their ship covered in ejaculation in La Paz.
The public buildings bear a blue flag of the sea.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazons are embossed with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
“Recovering it is a duty.”
Across Bolivia's landlocked territory, the record of a lost coast off Chile in a conflict of cruel resources in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the angel of sailing back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia looks forward to the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, not to say, expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the resolution of the TIJ on large screens across the country, in the hope that the Court of The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate the granting of a sovereign sea-going trip to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes laid out in Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised last August.
However, some analysts think that it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that, should you do so, things would not change much.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The TIJ’s resolution, which comes just six months after the final allegations were filed, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from being favored, the cause of Bolivia may have experienced a setback in the last four years.
“The current Bolivian administration has hidden the issue of access to the sea,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
“The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile,” he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold conversations after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, representing Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court’s decision was exceptionally swift.
Next Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of discrepancies, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Resolution is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke last Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His statements come at a time when it appears that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume stagnant nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s a chimera to think that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration that puts an end to the Korean War can make North Korea never kneel.
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement if Pyongyang does not make major disarmament moves earlier.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the fact that Pyongyang is taking seriously the issue of renouncing an arsenal that the country considers the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of large-sized bars, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or want to completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the runway a range of extravagant, disproportionate sized hats from their SS19 collection, which illuminated the style defined in Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been torn apart by very few practical hats, and these designers have brought their amazing creations to the runway.
Valentino’s featured piece was an exaggerated beige hat, adorned with a broad, lead-shaped wing, which flooded the head of the models.
Among other oversized accessories, there were jolly sindries, a wig hat and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extra-curricular masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, of bright colors, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than not of high seams.
One creation resembled a complete team of submariners, with tubes and glasses, while another resembled a thick ice cream cone.
And if you follow the great fashion trends, you’re in luck.
Style observers predict that huge barriers could be implanted in the main streets near you.
The large hats climb the heels of "the Bomb", a ball hat, with a two-foot wide wing, which everyone has carried, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label of worship behind the little practical hat that escaped the social networks brought another great creation to the runway: a ball bag for the beach, almost as big as the model dressed in a swimsuit that carried it.
The raffle bag, dark orange, decorated with raffle locks and finished with a white leather nansa, was the highlight piece of the collection La Riviera SS19 by Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I hope to see people wearing big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Considering that the designer has had a big impact, it would be a shame that the demand for large accessories was ignored.
John Edward: Linguistic competences are essential for the world’s citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a trajectory of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students from around Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer a service of the best level to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a very popular and desired topic of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you’ll get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will come to his heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to establish relationships and generate trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of the current examinations, we can see that the languages lead the ranking tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages got the A-higher grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, reflected that 72% of students obtained a higher A qualification in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are maintained in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans from independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted in 2014 by the UK’s Commission on Occupation and Competence revealed that for the reasons that entrepreneurs gave to the fact that they were costing them to cover vacancies, 17% was attributed to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
Since there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the race a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person in front of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
Knowing different languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find an important job.
In Scotland, there is diversity among schools in the languages they are taught.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK in the future, by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, you can always choose from a number of languages in independent schools, which have specialist teaching staff in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
In today’s global trading environment, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be of vital importance to the country’s future, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered “international communicative competences”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.

LeBron will debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait has practically ended for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday's first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still have to decide what minutes you’re going to play.
“They’ll be more than one and less than 48,” Walton told the Lakers.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers journalist, tweeted that James will probably play a few minutes.
After early training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign actions tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first of five scheduled meetings for next week, which include visits to sympathetic locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court vacancy is pending, Trump intends to get support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you be seen online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s meeting in West Virginia can be seen online at the link specified below, via live video streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing this week with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense over the allegations of sexual abuse he faces, while the Senate’s expected confirmation vote remains pending until a week later and the FBI investigates the case.
But the main goal of this wave of meetings is to help Republicans who stand in the delicate November elections to gain momentum.
Therefore, the five meetings of President Trump’s campaign scheduled for next week are aimed at “stimulating volunteers and sympathizers, while Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, as we head toward a troubled campaign season,” a Trump spokesman said in a statement.
This evening’s meeting, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could gather supporters “from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract coverage of Pittsburgh’s media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavourable results in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and give him a boost in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows ambition to keep hopes alive for individual Sunday matches
After three unmatched sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of dynamics is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this one.
So on what side is the positive dynamics now?
“They had a six-point advantage and now it’s four, so I think we’re on a small positive streak,” said Jordan Spieth as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and have many reasons to be excited, largely by the form state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tea to green and is setting an example.
Gutural celebratory cries rose as he continued his turn and remained a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the match in hole 15 with a similar shout, the kind that indicates he believes the American team is not out of the competition yet.
“You have to do your best and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for these players now.
18 holes to leave a footprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple wear four out of four and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a crazy Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the crazy Saturday mornings and Friday afternoons, and the last nine holes Friday mornings.
For this result and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the public buzz, it is reaffirmed that they are the players batting on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory while the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Speaking of European glory, however, seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, who married Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes pushed Spanish and Swedish into a hole from which they never had a chance to get out.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to see because of the interactions between the pairings, the tips they give and the ones they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change from time to time.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with a major advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the U.S. team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the U.S., had questioned.
Europe reach the Ryder Cup final with a 10-6 mark
Europe will face the last day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable edge after finishing Saturday’s fours and fours with a 10-6 win over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to win two victories against a Tiger Woods in difficulty and leave their record, so far, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to preserve the trophy he lost two years ago to Hazeltine, dominated an undefeated American team in the morning's four-balls and put the series in 3-1.
The U.S. presented more resistance to the foursomes and won two games, but could not reduce the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to score eight points in Sunday's 12 individual matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known by the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to earn four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder.
After slaving Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they called a brilliant performance to hit a Woods deflated and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had pitched in two games on Saturday, showed spurs of sporadic genius, but lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning four-balls, re-teamed with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe did not have it all in mind on a pleasant and windy day in the southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a point of reference for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They scored a 2-1 victory against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team had climbed a four-point difference to individual matches, although the team of Furyk, defending the title, only needs to tie to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, it seems that a Sunday counterattack that comes is out of reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm “in any way” unless signs of trust are appreciated
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying its distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" during the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing center and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not observe any response in consonance with the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will not unilaterally initiate disarmament in any way.”
Although Ri resumed North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization approach by which North Korea would be rewarded as it gradually took action, his statements seemed significant in the fact that he did not reject the denuclearization as a single, plebiscite.
Ri made reference to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a U.S.-led president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised assurances of North Korea’s security.
North Korea has attempted to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that denuclearization must first occur and increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its objective in a coercive manner, as well as oppose the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are intensifying our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the part involved in the issue of denuclearization was South Korea instead of the U.S., the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is not on the Coke Peninsula.
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from what it held last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles on U.S. territory was inevitable after President “Mr. Evil” Trump dubbed Kim “Rocket Man in a Missile.”
Meanwhile at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still much to do and sanctions had to be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of sanctions by the Security Council must continue energetically and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously pushed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but after a few hours North Korea accused him of making "inquiries of a gangster's own."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and nuclear complex if the United States took “consonance measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “consonance measures” he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest habits.
Now, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the ever-expanding culture of studying all night, stimulated by caffeine.
An academic noted that often students from the world's number-one university are disappointed with the basic aspects of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course after making a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me now, all this, in my last year?’
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
In the course, implemented for the first time this year, students are explained the basic concepts about how good habits of sound improve academic and sports performance, in addition to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said the University decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffer from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, bamboos and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, how it affects sports performance in lack of sleep, and the importance of maintaining a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of suffering from heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” said Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride of staying up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure that students suffer make sleep deprivation an ever-increasing problem.
Making sure to enjoy a good quality sleep for a long time should be a “secret weapon” for students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, since the deprivation of sleep puts the brain in a state of inattention and makes them always study.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask graduate students to undertake a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students take into account the fact that they set an alarm when going to sleep and when they wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that emit the electronic displays and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of the sound of the rhyme.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disjointed team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's home that involves another knockout.
Ibrox's team sought to add their first home win since last February's 4–1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to leave their team to drift, 8 points ahead of the Premiers and the Hearts' lead.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before half-time, and it never seemed like the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equalize the score.
As the Rangers now fall to sixth place, the Livingstons are in third place, behind the Hibernian by goal difference.
And the Rangers could face further difficulties later, as line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that apparently kicked off the grid.
Gerrard made eight changes to the Ayr line-up in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same 11-man titler who scored a point against the Hearts last week. Probably, he felt satisfied with the way his well-organized team smothered their rivals at all times.
While the Rangers dominated the possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored in the two minutes of the match, when Menga's first intervention left Scott Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder went away and missed the big opportunity.
A sharp foul throw by Keaghan Jacobs struck with Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only made a slant in the back half.
The Rangers took control, but seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a penalty on the 15-minute signal, as he and Steven Lawless met, but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only led two juts to the first half, but Ibrox's first goaltender, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header and forward docile Ovie Ejaria.
While the first act of the Livs in the 34th minute could have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Again, the Rangers could not afford Jacobs' hard-working play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to choose Menga for a simple final.
Gerrard took a break from changing Coulibaly to Ryan Kent. The change had a near-immediate impact, as the extreme made a pass to Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran into the block.
However, the Livingstons continued to catch the attention of visitors by playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one rere the other.
Holt's band may have ceded the lead in the final stages, but McGregor remained firm in rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow made a slanted jute from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still sought a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson made his eyes thick.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually gave way to the device we know as a "Geiger computer".
The Geiger counter, which has been a pillar of science since then, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, seemingly failed cowboy physicists:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms emanating from radioactivity to minerals.”
Evans: "It's definitely blowing up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and eliminate malignant cells
Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to Recognize Bad Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory
You can "see" a common protein in many cancers and then re-inject them.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the ovarian cancer that she had been suffering for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting a patient’s immune cells, altering them in the laboratory to be able to “see” a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2) and then injecting them again.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: “The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein “promotes the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after her performance on the SNL program.
It didn't end well.
Kanye West was written in the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would run in the 2020 election.
After her third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which she wore a Make America Great Again cap, she began to criticize the Democrats and reiterate her support for Trump.
“Every time I talk to white people, they tell me, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s racist?’
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee for allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Though not aired, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's disapproval to social media.
It was not clear if Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well treated between frames because of the hat he wore.
"They threatened him in the backstage.
They told me you didn't go out with that hat on.
I'm from Assetjar.
And then they say I'm in a lower position," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the bottom position?" as he said he would put on Superman's coat so they couldn't tell him what to do.
“Try to love.”
His comments provoked the audience's writing at least twice and the members of the program's team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, that there was a reporter who explained to the publication: "The whole study was completely muted."
West took over as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, the former of whom rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West left much of the audience perplexed with the performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR DISAPPOINTING BETWEEN MULTITUDE."
But debate show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “being who she is and that she’s absolutely wonderful.”
But I have chosen not to reward someone (including their music or clothing or supporting their “art”) who I believe adopts and disseminates an ideology that harms my community.
He is free.
And so do we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed and that it was now "previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy’s footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and the missing legend of Prince music changed its name to a symbol and later the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted stabbing murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder following Friday's stabbing of a man in eastern Belfast.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast court of first instance on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star, Kit Harington, denounces a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for portraying the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the male-hero stereotype, stating that these roles make it clear that young boys often believe they have to be strong to be respected.
In an interview with Culture magazine of The Sunday Times, Kit said he believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the co-star of Game of Thrones, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, has admitted that she is determined to deal with this problem.
“Personally, I’m now wondering where we’ve been wrong about masculinity,” he says.
“What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?”
According to Kit, television may be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its so virile characters.
He added: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this kind of virility?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
Because no doubt something has been done wrong with the young boys.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for next summer, saying he is tired of battles and horses.
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his partner Rose is the best that has provided him Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in the series, so she gave me my future family and my life forward,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in an Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are of sexual transmission, unlike what used to happen.
Traditionally, HIV was rapidly spreading in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people contracting HIV for this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is commonplace.
Taking into account the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who maintain homosexual relationships end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate precautions in sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has leaked data from Republican Party senators and dismantles "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information from three U.S. Republican senators to the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the demands were driven by critics and far-right websites.
"Lies, lies, and more menaceable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Supposedly, the published information contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published by someone unknown in the Capitol during a session of the Senate commission on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservatives, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to the Waters office and that it revealed information from a Waters staff member, the Capitol reported.
“This baseless allegation is completely false and a pure lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, the identity, the personal data and the security of which have been compromised because of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not in any way responsible for this filtering of information.
This groundless denunciation is completely false and a pure invention.”
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of indignation,” Fleischer wrote.
“That makes me think he doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
You don’t have to question the defendant’s motives.
You have to keep calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to overthrow Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"It matters if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces of these fraudulent statements.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed," he continued, "and that they will be legally held responsible for all actions that have taken place and that have harmed all and every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again: Rowan Atkinson's Limited Spy Parody
It is already tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British focus, and this replacement of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and reappeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
Will this humorous self-satisfaction about how we are of the least apprehensive will be a new export opportunity of the country?
In any case, the incompetent eyes out and rubber face Johnny English has been able to renew his license for the second time to break it all. His name indicates more than anything else that is a comic creation designed for non-English speaking territories with a tradition of going to the cinema.
Obviously, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims of liquefied glamor, has a bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean, and a touch of this pair that brings a single note to the theme of Cars of Fire to the inaugural ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on the international and mysterious Atkinson traveler who represented the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, where he was sowing chaos all over the place.
There are one or two good moments in this last journey of me.
I loved the Johnny English who was approaching a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the leaves of the helix were sticking to the helmet.
He sees the gift Atkinson has for physical comedy, but humor seems rather fluid and strangely superfluous, especially because "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems intended for children rather than adults and, for me, Johnny English’s absurd adventures are not as ingenious or focused as the silent gags of the character Mr. Bean representing Atkinson.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the British supersecret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, causing the service agent's dismay, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and beset figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this bald character of Teresa-May, but the script does not get any further.
His intelligence advisors inform him that, as each active spy is put in danger, he will have to recover some of his retirement.
And this includes the evil Johnny English, now employed as a teacher at some luxury institution, but teaching unofficial classes on how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers a spy academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his sequential sufferer Bough, a role that reprises Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little disinterested.
Thus, the Batman and Robin of when things go very smoothly in the secret service of His Majesty enter into action once more and find in Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "fatal woman" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the tech billionaire charismatic who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous crazies: disguised as chambrers, they set fire to a French fast-food restaurant, they seem to be in the chaos of smuggling on board the luxury yacht of Volta and English provokes great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to get familiar with it.
All the stops have certainly been taken out of this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and noise it presents, everything folded seems like a children’s program.
Quite normal things.
As with the other Johnny English films, it has not been helpful to think about whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role to do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is conceiving a plan for the British to have a four-day working week and cover five of them.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan according to which the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of companies to pass on the savings obtained with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers by giving them one more day of celebration.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but they would receive the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would fit the economic agenda of the party and plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The shift to a four-day work week has the support of the trade union Confederation Trades Union Congress as a method for workers to benefit from economic change.
An experienced Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won’t be overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration that fits the party’s perspective of balancing the economy in favor of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration in a joint way today.
According to a Labour Party spokesman, "A four-day work week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The minister’s shadow plans also imply that shareholders of the water companies might not recover the entire investment, as the Labour government could apply “deductions” for the crimes it perceived.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers in company boards and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector firms’ shares to employees, who expect to plunge in annual dividends worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy explain to "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could make them change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised the question of whether the agency's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring out something that made them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I’m serious,” Kennedy said.
“At the session I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it all happened and the charges were made public, and I asked him if he had done so.
He was strong, determined, and confident.”
But Graham's vote seems to have been set on fire.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and would file an explosive charge," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett was roundly denying it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“The person you’re appointing won’t be able to verify it.
She's 36 years old.
I don’t see anything changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday’s Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event, featuring an absolutely impressive star program, which carry out an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition of this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to awaken awareness of the global goal of the 20th anniversary event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who help fight it actively.
To receive a free entry for the event (whether someone wants to pay for a VIP entry), attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other activity to raise awareness about the power of awareness.
What success has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just one more case of what we call "clitivism" (people who think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters, which have helped achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will have impacted the lives of more than 2,250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least US$10 billion has already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that currently protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major commitments include The Power of Nutrition Foundation, a UK-based association of investors and developers, which is committed to "helping children grow as much as possible" and promises to send to Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 global tweets.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a page foothold in history,” said the 2018 London-based Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced the funding of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+Fs on his website asking "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen responded, "It will be a long and hard road. Sometimes, we fall and we fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements of the past, we will triumph, because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who performed at the current event in New York City, featuring Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a “block” to block Russian energy exports (Interior Secretary)
Washington may, “if necessary” resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke has denounced Russia’s intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, as a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern pancha of Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
"The United States has the capacity, together with the Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, for blocking, to prevent its energy from entering the market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the “energy consumer’s voice” in the U.S.
He compared Washington’s strategies to negotiate with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are indeed the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia consists, more or less, in taking advantage of and replacing fuels,” he said, pointing out that Russia has only one resource, as its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to exit the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project "inappropriate", which Trump said made Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which has cost $11 billion and which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 11 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I think we share the view that I’energy cannot be a tool to pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, held in Moscow this month.
The U.S. stance has provoked a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main sector organisation, the FDI (Federation of German Industries), has called on the US to step aside from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industries Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “detainfully think” about her 2020 presidential bid.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "detainfully" think about her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government’s fracture, for women to hold high positions,” he said.
“After November 6th, I will take my candidacy for president seriously.”
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said he was “bringing the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been frank in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “It’s clear that an FBI investigation is needed before the election.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters believed that it should not be submitted by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts's "probable" voters said the senator should not appear, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey revealed broader support for the candidacy of ex-Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats that were considered in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites victim of PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump meeting
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after joining on September 11, 2007
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
“With what’s going on with my own son since he came back, I can understand other families suffering ramifications of PTSD and some of the emotional wounds our soldiers are returning with,” Trump told the audience at a meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following to his son and other war veterans: "They come back a little different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots are doing, as well as any other country's ex-members.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a declaration of domestic violence and gun violence under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokeswoman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support the challenge to a new asylum policy
Nine states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives from 18 states and the district presented a curiae friend in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the children of the violent gang member" attacked her, but U.S. officials denied her application for asylum on July 20.
They arrested her in Texas.
Attorneys from the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the U.S., as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy “ignore decades of state, federal and international legislation.”
Federal laws require that asylum applications be adjudicated according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued in the report that the policy that denies the entry of immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary jobs".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
"Asylum is available to those people who leave their country for persecution or for reasons of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in its June 11 announcement.
Asylum has never sought to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a sprint to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
“The environment is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, 35, as she calmed her son with fever at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
Lack of drinking water."
Residents have been seen returning to their homes destroyed to take on unscathed belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of injured, and hospitals, plagued by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are outside Palu's military hospital, as patients are treated outside due to the heavy squabbles that are repeated.
The tears denied his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
“I heard my wife crying for help and then I didn’t hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of "advertising propaganda".
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump last Wednesday addressed China Daily’s payment supplement to The Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, an indictment that China denies.
Trump’s indictment that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters is a new phase of Washington’s campaign to intensify pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to put in advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a deepening trade war that has seen the oranges stick to mutual imports.
China’s vengeful arrangements at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at punishing state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers and U.S. companies.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article on The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It is redoubled by the publication of propaganda ads in our free press."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the esteemed American tradition of free speech and free press to insert a payment ad into The Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“Instead, at the kiosk that there is a street down here in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and you will see no real reflection of the disparate opinions that Chinese citizens can have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, since the media are dominated by the Communist Party,” he said.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers evaded the offer to publish" his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans set aside women's voters ahead of mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
As many of the top Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple requests for sexual assault, analysts have warned they will see a negative response, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans are already officially showing that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things cannot be undone," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, told The Hill for an article that was published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to conduct an FBI investigation is enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the Protestants shouted "November is coming!" (November approaches) while protesting in the Senate vestibule while Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will be out of the picture," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site.
“People say they’ve been tall; it’s true.
But it could have been more, especially among the voters of suburban women and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who often don’t vote until they like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, where he detailed his demands for sexual assault on the candidate in the Supreme Court, analysts would suggest that a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed for confirmation.
“This has become an embolism for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote of the board or the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh sits at the defendants’ bank. It also has to do with how Republicans have handled this issue and how they have dealt with it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect non-democrats.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in the Ford stele and the witnesses of Kavanaugh, with the scale slightly decimating towards the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in an undoubted or probable way in Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they believe in an undoubted or probable way in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or undoubtedly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claimed the same from Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's applications and, at least, another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the effects of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez complains that the Supreme Court candidate taught her genitals at a party while studying in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the website, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is based on Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s hidden intention was to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, pending task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify. They’re all available in one browser at a time.
What is exclusive of the personal online data storage is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is that the company integrates resources, processes and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some template developers hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications through the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said none of his team is talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models run out completely overnight.
“We’re not asking for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a Saturday publication in the Medium that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website integrated into the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Clergy of the Victory Cross of the 1st GM
The only clergyman in the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honour.
Her two grandchildren unveiled a memorial plaque at a parade on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone appeared exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning prose.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battalion along the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns".
He later ran towards the line of fire and, with the "maximum courage", he advanced the line before launching himself on a single-handed cannon and leaving three members of the detachment stunned.
The lieutenant colonel was shot down by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were a feat he could never match, which gives him a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of an authentic hero is demonstrated by the support he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who stayed out of sleep all night to see Bellator 206, saw the Peppa Pig in its place.
Imagine that you stay up all night to see Bellator 206 and that you are denied to see the most important event.
The San José cartel contained 13 fights, including six from the main card and had to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for the confrontation, the UK viewers were stunned when programming switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted by having spent the night awake until the morning to see the struggle.
A Twitter follower described the change in cartoons as "a kind of vomity acuity."
"Government regulations say that at 6:00 a.m. this content is not appropriate, so they switched to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the retransmission.
"Shut up the fuck, yeah."
Bellator president Scott Coker said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we can’t solve it until Sunday at our time, Monday at yours.
But we are working there.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were many messages that were coming and going, and not all were pleasant.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We'll leave him in five fights, instead of six as we normally do. We tried to show him back to the fans, but it was over.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" about sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but this provided him with the motivation to triumph.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs program, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to other people.
He also said that being a father had remained important to him in winning the Olympic Games.
The regular host of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off for illness.
Daley, who appeared as a naufrag on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less than" others because "it was not socially acceptable like boys and girls".
“To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me the power and the strength to triumph.”
He wanted to prove that it was “something,” he said, not to disappoint anyone when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "took me by surprise".
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you pass by when you are young (he participated in his first Olympic Games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple were parents in June of a child they named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "all their perspective" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold," he said.
“There are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is said to be the same as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he was to die and one of the last things he asked for was if they already had tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be there to occupy the front row,’” he said.
“As he grabbed his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that it wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics. There was no better feeling," he said.
He also inspired the third of his first song (Heather Small's Proud), which he had heard in preparation for the Olympic Games and which still put his chicken skin on.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A poor Mickelson made his appearance at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson is set to break a record Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his physical state if he doesn’t want to become an unhappy stripper.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's "fourball" and "foursome" modes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has usually been for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments divides his time between making animator and working on his game in the field, in the hope of rectifying what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for the difficult Le Golf National career, where the long rough is used to punish the deflected shots.
And if his own career is not discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will face the exact champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual matches, start strong, Mickelson’s match could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, without being able to say much more.
“He perfectly understood his role for that day, he patted me on the back and surrounded me with his arm as he told me he would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It is a hall of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn’t think of him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that’s how I trained and that’s how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record of the maximum number of Ryder Cup games played.
It may mean the end of a Ryder Cup race that has not matched your individual record.
Mickelson has scored 18 wins, 20 defeats and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has contributed intangibles to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to laugh at people and he's a great partner for the team," he said.
"I think the younger players were having fun staying with him this week too, which has been fun to see.
It brings a lot more to your game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the advantage can soon fade away
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily become a hard day.
The Danish made his debut in Valderrama in 1997, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the American team, but in the end they won by a minimum of 14.5–13.5.
"And you continue to remember that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but by little," Bjorn said in the picture, after seeing the 2018 team's victory on Friday 5-3 on both Friday and Friday.
History has taught me and all the members of the team that is not yet finished.
Tomorrow we have to go to the machine.
You have to go out and do it all right.
This doesn’t end until the points can’t be scored.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do so.
I’ve already said that, I’m focused on the 12 players we have in the team, but I also have present who are our rivals: the best players in the world.”
Enchanted with the performance of his players in a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: "I will never rush with this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow the individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It’s great to be there with a partner when everything is fine, but individual duels test your ability to play golf to the maximum.
This is the message that you have to pass on to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this point, leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself too.”
In opposition to Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to score better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about the last day's draws, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" that won Europe.
“I remember exactly all the words,” he replied to the question about how he motivated Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to start with a good foot, as we saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, a lot of pressure is generated in these central duels.
We have prepared the alignment based on the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has the challenge of trying to start the match against Rory McIlroy in the lead, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
“I have chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities,” Bjorn says of his selection for individual confrontations.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The new frigate of the German Navy should have ended in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warships, but it won't, at least, until next year, deal with faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but the post-construction problems have marked the terms of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as anti-fraud technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other highlights include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates up to two years without going through national ports.
However, these continuous delays imply that the state-of-the-art ships, which were predicted to be able to project Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they enter service, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was already news last year, when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss deck in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder once delivered.
Few details are known of the reasons why it has returned, but German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it useless if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, as about 120 sailors, half of the crew necessary for the old Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the ship's weight is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz will weigh twice as much as class ships apparently used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty materials, the cost of the project, which includes training the crew, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached a surprising <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.6 billion) from an initial budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of particular importance, given the recent warnings indicating that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy “is running out of ships that can be used.”
The officer has stated that the situation has worsened over time because the old ships were no longer used, but none of them were provided as a replacement.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Foundation Spyes on the Secret Life of Ratpens
A new research carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland aims to find out how ratpenats use the landscape to feed themselves.
The findings are expected to provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study of scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will follow soprano and common ratpenata, as well as northern eared ratpenata and water in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to keep track of the activities of the ratpenats during the station.
Volunteers and staff of the UK National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The analysis of the sound of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the rats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a map of the habitat will be created to create a detailed scale image of the landscape of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural conservation adviser at the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for ratpents and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and how to improve the maintenance of forests for rattans and other associated species.
The population of rattlesnakes in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
The construction and restoration tasks of buildings threaten the ratpenats, as they affect the nest and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighthouses also pose a risk, as do the killing paper and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, they are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, the ears are more useful than the eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to locate insects and obstacles that interpose on their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the prisoners very seriously.
He has ten experts with the right training, who conduct surveys, inspections of nests and, sometimes, rescued in a usual way.
Even so, the organization has created Scotland's first and only reserve dedicated to ratpenats at the Threada Estate estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten ratpenat species.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, claims that it is the ideal territory for the species.
“Here at Threave, we have a large area for the rats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and even a good habitat.
But we still don’t know many aspects of ratpenata, so the work we do here and other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
Note the importance of verifying whether there are pennies before performing maintenance tasks on properties, since it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single nest of motherhood kills more than 400 females and young, which could lead to the disappearance of an entire local population.
Rats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, attack them, harass them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Rat Penate Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn from the ratpenata and, in the case of some of our species, we don’t have enough data on its population.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape as his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that allegations of rape against him are "fake news" and has stated that people "want to get famous" thanks to his name.
His lawyers will sue German weekly Der Spiegel, who is responsible for publishing the charges.
The Portuguese forward and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid at the time $375,000 for the incident not to be made public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video targeting his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo said they were “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is fake news,” says the five-time Golden Pilot winner on camera.
“They want to be famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to use my name to make themselves famous, but it’s part of my job.
I’m a happy man and everything is in order,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the charges, which they have described as “unacceptable information of suspicions about private life,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz has stated that the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most flagrant violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of Las Vegas hotel and casino Palms.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to reports filed in the Clark County District Courthouse.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told him that he was a "99% good boy", except for a "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that they both had sex, but were consented.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed in the hospital, but later accepted an out-of-court settlement because she had "fear of reprisals" and worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she seeks to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer he signed for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘would always be penalized’ for losing car manufacturers
The UK would "always regret it" if it lost the world leader in post-Brexit manufacturing, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota's UK base had told the BBC that, if the UK left the European Union without reaching any agreement, it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement at the end of March, production at our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade with the rest of the EU countries will work has aroused fears from other UK car manufacturers such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is made on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and European Union suppliers for the manufacture of cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without reaching an agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbances at the border, which the sector believes could generate delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and it would have to stop production as a result.
Clark says Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
"We have to come to an agreement. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The tests not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains.”
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long production would stop, but in the long run, it has warned that the added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and could cause the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of Unite the Union at the plant, said members are beginning to be very concerned about the situation: “In experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have designed an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be back on track.
Donald Trump’s long-awaited meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “married for a week” as the fight over the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, continues in White House statements on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in elections, links between Russia and Trump’s aid and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump condones or not the deputy attorney general and puts Mueller’s independence at risk has fuelled rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times already reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of having a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of filing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors he was about to resign.
However, a meeting was announced for Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not" condone Rosenstein, but postponed the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the entire Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may be one more week for all issues with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists might disprove this claim: Sanders has not held any White House briefings since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of information sessions was not because he did not like the fanfare of television journalists, although he said, "I will not deny that they are fanfare."
He also said that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, before adding the following without citing any source: "We have consulted this data."
Sanders stated that the briefings will continue to take place, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the president of the United States, it’s far infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, you’ve seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and they’ll replace the briefing sessions when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries on official visits.
Individual press wheels are not very frequent.
This week, in New York, the president may have shown why, after an informal appearance and, at times, strange in front of the assembled journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers of Scottish National Health Service over fears of Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and wishes to continue there after Brexit.
Scottish Parliament member Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of state-of-residence applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit have continued, and still seems to be geared towards the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in the event of a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a busy time for all of you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate now that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service’s task, while benefiting patients and the communities we treat.
“Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee State Tigers' relay, has undergone an emergency operation after suffering a late-Saturday injury in the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Tennesseen's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told the press that the injury occurred shortly before half of the injury.
“He came on the band line and collapsed there,” Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before placing him in a litter box and dragging him to make more tests.
A Tennessee State official has informed Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the clinic at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It is Abercrombie's first season, second year, with Tennessee State after signing from Illinois.
He had completed five runs on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty by buying a property in the UK with the additional money used to help homeless people according to the Conservative Party’s new plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn's movement to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp duty will be taxed on those people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Hisenda hopes to get up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are expected to be taxed a higher stamp duty on buying a property in the UK and this money will be used to help homeless people, a measure Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be taxed on those people and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will go to government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The surplus, which will be added to the current stamp tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second homes and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
Hisenda expects to get up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up on the property scale.
Many of the country’s wealthier areas, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp duty to help young people have their first home.
He accused the big constructs of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel the affordable home quotas to correct Britain's "real estate disaster".
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as controls on rent and the completion of the "no fault" denunciations.
He also wants to give more power to the municipalities to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life has to improve for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be correct that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away and the indignity of the homeless makes it even more real.”
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old has accepted the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which currently ranks third in League One, three points behind the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning to the St Mirren in the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
They called me once in support and that’s all,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching a lot of playing Scotland at Hampden with my father when I was little and it’s always something that makes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in training in clubs, but I will.”
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland coaching include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's coach says he doesn't feel the pressure to be next on a list of names on such a large team, after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Right now, my criteria for measuring my success will be if I can get this team back in the Premier League.
"With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that its place is the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would only consider that I’ve had success here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months in the technical corps of the Hearts.
He helped the Alloa avoid falling into the third category and transformed the St Mirren from fighting for the salvation of Championship champions the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his time as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a decisive moment," he recalled about accepting the position at Alloa.
“I had always believed that training was what was best for me, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did it right, I got out reasonably and I enjoyed quite good moments at all.
Playing can be very hard.
There are a lot of things you need to do each week.
I still go through it in aspects like stress and pressure at work, but I feel good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, it’s the most comfortable time I’ve felt since I was an adult.”

The perfect time for a painting is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, according to a study
The summer heatwave has shot up consumption in bars with difficulties in Britain, but has added more pressure to the restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains have gained a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant consumption has fallen by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s financial advisory firm, the company that has collected the data, states the following: “The continuing hours of sunshine and England’s participation in the World Cup, which has widened more than expected, have caused July to follow a similar pattern to June’s 2nd overtime, with more than 8 per cent of the year’s turnover.
The reduction of 1.8% in consumption in restaurants in June has worsened in July.
The bars and taverns, led by the consumption of beverages, have obtained the best results, while the consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, beverage sales have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, of leisure and hotel analysts RSM, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to the sales of the foreign leisure market.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a 4.8% year-on-year decline in sales would be especially damaging, more than the continued pressure on costs.
“This long and warm summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food-serving businesses and time will tell if the mildest temperatures we’ve had in August will provide this much-needed breath.”
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7% in July, indicating the encouragement in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sector sales indicator for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined loss of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 million and is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents.
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, according to data from a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in “false Insta” pages
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students say they have a "principal" account that shows parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in Insta’s “false” accounts, a reference to Instagram, the place to share photos.
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students say they have a net “main” account that they show to parents, while they also have one in private.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account saw a message from a teenager urging others to “violate me.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Private School Directors (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of teens between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of whom have admitted to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” in the direction of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation's board of directors at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most medal-winning field and track athlete and President Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his dilute international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has the respect of the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its incorporation into the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very much looking forward to acting as an athlete’s voice and I hope to be able to grow the sport and contribute to Scotland.”
The American, who won gold in the 200s and 400s at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, among a total of four Olympic golds and is currently a regular BBC commentator, was barred from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
She wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a cerebral hemorrhage.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I can recover or to what extent.
It’s been exhausting, but I’ve recovered completely, I’ve learned to walk again and today it’s time to do agility exercises!
Thank you for your soul-messages!”
An ad that compares mothers with cows shares opinion on the Internet
A bulldog company has shared its opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares nursing mothers with cows that are mutating.
To mark the release of what is considered the "first silent tirall that can be carried from the world", consumer tech company Elvie has issued an ad inspired by a joke music video to show the freedom that the new tirall gives to mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of ferrets and cows at the rhythm of a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I mutter myself, but you will not see a tail" and "For if you hadn't noticed, they're not braguers, but my breasts".
The return continues: “Bomb, bomb, feed the babies, bomb, bomb, lots of girls.”
However, the announcement, published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom claim to show the “horrors” of the lactic industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference being that they are separated from their babies a few days after giving birth,” one person wrote.
The Elvie Tirallet is discreetly hidden in a lactation holder (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented on the following: “Understandably traumatic for the mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a mother-in-law who will keep their babies?”
Another user added: "It's an ad out of place".
Other people defended the ad; one woman admitted that she found the song to be "fun."
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would buy one if I still had to give it to my mom.
Pumping for the tirallet made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but you have to take it as it is.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
Another person commented on the following: "It's a fun ad for mothers who bombard with sleds (usually at their workplace or in the sink and feel like they're cows.
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the lactic industry.”
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the discreetly made tiralet to the supporters.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women feel as if they are cows when using the sledgehammer.
However, Elvie is completely silent, has no cable or tube and discreetly fits into a lactation holder, giving women more freedom to move, subject babies and even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, Mother's first childhood partner and developer, said: "The Elvie sled is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
In drawing the parallelism between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how to use a sledgehammer and the challenges that it entails doing so, while demonstrating, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new sledgehammer offers.
This isn't the first time Elvie has been on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of emigrant children, quietly transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased even though monthly entries across the border have practically remained stable, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate children.
Traditionally, most of the patrons were undocumented immigrants, who were afraid to risk their chances of staying in the country if they decided to host a child.
The risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential employers and the rest of adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to welcome unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrests had no prior criminal record.
“About 80% of the people who have hosted or live in the home of a person who has hosted are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
To prosecute children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to refugee workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than face-to-face, to defend their case to obtain legal status before an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The longer the children spend in custody, the more likely they will be to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent rampages or attempts to escape, according to the workers and reports that they have made known the system in recent months.
Lawyers claim that these concerns can be intensified in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where it is more likely that, due to its size, signs that a child is suffering will be passed over.
They have added that moving children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria urges “occupational forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were in Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "the issue will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the “war on terror has almost ended” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we have purged the entire Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces that oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 troops on the ground of a country hit by the war.
On the refugee issue, Muallem has stated that the conditions were good for his return and has blamed "some Western countries" for evading "irrational grounds" that make refugees want to stay away.
“We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing a matter that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to reconstruction for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats have said that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last large rebel stronghold, Idlib, has favored the opportunity to continue with political meetings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem noted that the agreement has "clear terms" and expressed hope that military action will confront the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Nusra Front, linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a UN envoy, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to begin to outline a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the 2020 election again unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to expect, the scandals and the process of ousting end his presidency prematurely.
That would, without a doubt, be “the end of a more dramatic presidency in history.”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in peak audience hours has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and virtually tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on peak audience time, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show,” has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers in the mainstream newscasts.
“People have been blown away because they don’t understand it,” said Neal Baer, executive producer of the ABC series “Designated Survivor,” about a cabinet decree that happens to be the president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
He recalled a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
"He answered me that because he made him laugh," Scovell told me.
There is an entertainment point in the chaos.
Of course, unlike television programs, the script that emerges from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, being an informed citizen is going further when you find yourself in the sixth hour of seeing a group of experts discuss the use that Bob Woodward has made of "for private use" sources for his book "Fear", the strawberry jacket that Trump's Post made the goldfish ("one piece")
In my case, I won’t look the same again as Super Mario.
“Part of what makes it seem like I’m part of a reality TV show is that every night it gives you something new,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” about character changes and the script twists of the Trump program (fight with the NFL, King-ar Jo).
You can’t afford to miss an episode because you’re left behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and he was doing it alone outside the house he has on the north coast of Kauai, but he was stuck watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
It could not be detached, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
“I remember when we did those sketchy programs then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it would be some kind of joke, but they seem to be right.”

Foreign money floods the races of the mid-term elections in the most adjusted House of Representatives
It is no surprise that there is a cash flood in Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the realignment of the congressional districts that has made two current members have to compete for the same seat.
This recent reassignment of Pittsburg's suburban district involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won the seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who enters into conflict with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial war between the main financial organizations of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was named in Pennsylvania after a tight victory in a much-followed special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have held office for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points of difference.
The political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on Salvador for its support of China, but withdraws them
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners pulled the Trump Organization management team out.
State Department officials have decided to remove heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions on the failure to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a department spokesman.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which in 2017 received US aid of $140 million, was contemplated, according to estimates, for drug trafficking control, development and economic improvements.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high death toll from murder and arrest.
With the passage of the internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue with a similar meeting held last year and which was seen as a step forward to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, effectively ending any likelihood of punishment for the Salvadoran.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of the importance that the administration attaches to it, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys returned discreetly to their positions of Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions by Washington.
A Bolton White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations since the anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from the anonymous, corroborated the statements.
A history study
The next event in the event could be Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, from which there is numerous evidence in public records.
Mueller also investigates whether Trump’s campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself reporting to the organization, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even before a jury of party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump, nor of any of his European names, is inevitable.
There are decisions that must be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officers were willing to make a coup d'état against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted it and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates over turning points such as this one and accelerates or reinforces the inexorable progress of democracy.
The U.S. is currently facing a number of setbacks.
What would happen if Trump acquiesced Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water in his neck since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated that he was not fit for office.
Rosenstein claims that the Times' information is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation that the FBI has requested about Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed for the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?"
And, in particular, will we vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will begin to run into danger.
But I don’t think we’ll fail because I’ve already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador's house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Saturday candles on that table with the swastika.
With this baggage, why shouldn’t I be optimistic about the future?”

Rangers optimist Graham Dorrans against Vienna's Rapid
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, aware that a victory against the Austrians, after an impressive match at the Vila-real camp this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify for the G Group of the Europa League.
An injury to the knee prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first minutes of the season until the 2-2 draw against Vila-real, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for great results.
"It was a positive point for us, because Vila-real is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We played the game believing we could get a valuable result and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something else in the end, but, in general, the game was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it's another big European night.
We expect to be able to stay with the three points, but it will be a difficult match because they made a good result in the last match, but I am sure we will give everything and achieve a good result with the support of the fans.
Last year was really hard, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it’s a good place to be.
The team is fine and the boys enjoy it, the trainings are good.
I hope we can give it all, leave it behind last season and succeed.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of savings for retirement
Although the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with the family.
Roughly half of respondents at the national level say they have spoken to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of respondents said they had talked to their children.
“People want someone to take care of them, but they don’t dare to put it up,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
We have to start here.
Talk to your partner and your children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t communicate your desires in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to decide where and how to get attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: It can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for your long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, an effective value-added hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover your expenses, or a self-insurance policy with your own resources.
Prepare your legal documents: cut the step into legal battles.
Look for a representative to be able to appoint a trusted person who will supervise your medical care and make sure that the professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the possibility of hiring a notary for your finances.
You should select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old family member has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specifies these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finances are not the only factor that has to be determined, but also with which doctors they want to be treated," Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready.”
Home shot several times with a compressed air gun in Ilfracombe
A man has received several shots of a compressed air gun while returning home after going out at night.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
"Officials have described the shooting, which occurred around 2.30 a.m. (in the 'British summer schedule'), as a 'random act'.
The victim has not seen his attacker.
His life is not in danger from injuries and the police have made a call to find witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a severe earthquake and tsunami that ravaged the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities. The death toll is expected to rise.
As communications are cut, the relief units have been unable to obtain information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu closest to the 7.5-magnitude earthquake epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of C<0xC3><0xA8>lebes Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km of coast to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region less than one province, had a population of approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the province of Celebes Central, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami in the west of Donggala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific fire belt and earthquakes are often caused with some frequency.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Ace, north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that devastated the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 shook a pop zone in the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 shook one of the islands of Mentawai, off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters that devastated dozens of towns and killed some 300 people.
2016: A soft earthquake affected Pidie Jaya's regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as the population recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died because of the buildings that fell.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly north of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she stretched her phone.
Palin is detained at the Mat-Su detention centre, where he is held with an unsecured bond of $500, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he was declared "not guilty, for sure" when asked how he was declared, according to the chain.
Palin faces three Class A felonies, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B misdemeanor, which can be punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference with the report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon in an embryonic state in connection with the incident.
His partner stated that he had given him a punch in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for associating her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service to Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake devastated the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks do not work and the death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Celebes Central, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social networks, videos are circulated with the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand exceptional death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary punishment that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan and to track pedestrians and cyclists along his route, in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that he "intentionally" caused serious personal injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty presented in the southern district of New York.
Both crimes could amount to a death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury attacked Saipov with a 22-fault indictment that included eight counts of murder in favor of organized crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said the attack required "considerable planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's way of acting as "inhuman, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullahevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pangnucco".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not demonstrate penance in the days and months following the attack.
Police said they told investigators that they felt good about what they had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov explained to authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
According to police, he also asked for the ISIS flag to be deployed to his hospital room.
He was found not guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the indictment's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a declaration of guilt and a perpetual chain without the possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party’s parliament says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should “feel the pressure of Eurosceptics” when one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said on the march in Birmingham that the UK would already be out of the EU if Mr Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Ms. May in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when the Conservatives in favor of the union have staged another protest against Brexit in La City.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers commitment plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, the EU and the EU.
The Allies insist that they will be able to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure Eurosceptics and the Conservative Party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr. Bone told Solihull’s Leave Means Leave meeting that he wanted to undo Chequers’ commitment.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have been out,” he said.
Member of Parliament Wellingborough added: “I will defend Brexit, but we must defy Chequers’ commitment.”
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone dismissed the suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British population has changed their minds and wants to stay there is totally false.”
The Conservative Brexit Party’s Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: “I’m just telling you, Prime Minister, to listen to people.”
"Chequers' commitment is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out on the streets and get us to win elections.
Give up Chequers' commitment and start listening."
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said politicians at the meeting must feel pressure if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"This, now, is a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them we won’t allow them.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.”
“We are mobilizing the popular troops of this country who gave us victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the union made a march through Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved banners over conservatives against Brexit after the group’s launch this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada deal plus, for the border without frictions, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to examine the possibility of running as a presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will examine the possibility of running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy president of the Massachusetts Trump campaign in 2016.
It has been the center of speculation about the possibility of taking over Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event at Holyoke was its 36th meeting with constituents in the open meeting format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run as a presidential candidate.
Warren responded that it’s time for “women to go to Washington to fix our government that doesn’t work, and that includes a woman in the dome.”
A person arrested for the death of Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge police, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the death of the basketball player of the LSU Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department has announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at the ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and called for collaboration to identify the man from the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and died near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot in the head that eventually killed him," police officer Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday for 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and received a shot from Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene, in possession of a gun, and having shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody in the East Baton district police department.
Sims, a 2 m junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts during the last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after team orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas was in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and nearly exhausted Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel went into boxing earlier and let Hamilton run with traffic at the back of the package, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop at the pits and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheeled action that caused the Ferrari driver to leave the free interior with the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third-round.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap was in seventh position on his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good position much of the race, as he kept his wheels to save time, advance to Kimi Raikkonen and move to fourth position.
He finally entered the boxing round No. 44, but was unable to increase the pace to the next eight laps and Raikkonen placed fourth.
It’s a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job throughout the weekend and he was a real gentleman who was told to let me pass.
The team has done a fantastic job of having a u-dos," Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein in a meeting Saturday to insist that she did not filter Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate demonstrated that people are “sick, cruel and lying.”
“One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that is happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people angry, mean, cruel and lying,” he said.
“When you look at the communications and the filtrations and say, ‘No, it wasn’t me.
It wasn’t me.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter?
Remember your answer... Did you filter the document? "Eh, what?
- No, no.
I didn’t filter it.”
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... No, we didn’t filter it,” he added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's statements against Kavanaugh in July and was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s statements, I didn’t filter his story,” Feinstein told The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it as confidential as he asked me to."
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at Saturday night's meeting: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing with his defense of the candidate in the Supreme Court, accused of inappropriate sexual behavior by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using statements with their own purpose.
“They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see evil, cruelty, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to fight for power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired Friday's Elite defeat against the Belfast Giants, as they won the return match 5–3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained a two-goal advantage thanks to the finishes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie rose to the level of their team, but then, Dwyer restored the Giants' advantage.
Francois Bouchard equalised the Dundee, and then two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won the Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, of Kendall McFaull's assist. Four minutes later, with the assistance of David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his advantage.
During this initial period, Sullivan again placed the home team in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt facilitated the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first break when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to his level with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game in the second half and secured his team's fifth goal victory near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to save hundreds of passengers from an airplane from an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has become a hero after dying to make sure that a plane with hundreds of passengers safely landed.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake shook the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas are occurring in the area and there are many people trapped between the runes in the city of Palu.
However, despite his companions escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat at the tremulous control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It remained in place to ensure that the Batik flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take the flight safely.
Then he got out of the air traffic control tower when he thought it was sinking.
He later died in the hospital.
A representative of Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“It broke my heart,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has announced that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies under the runes and there are still many that have not been accessed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's representative.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, who will celebrate a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the mini-markets have been looted.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working against clockwork to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the accident in the gap
The airline that operated a flight that was set to land in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although it was previously said that the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the plane that sank.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they did not find a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that on Saturday there were still six passengers in the hospital and that they were all in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of the events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane tied into the gap because the runway was short.
Some witnesses believe that the plane passed the runway high.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was going very low.
“That was extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to walk with water through the belt until the plane's emergency exit, which was sinking.
He said that the flight attendants were panicked and started shouting, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who had been working closely to improve a dock also helped rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the people affected to land before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of these accidents.
An analyst composes a chronology of the night that burned a woman alive
The prosecution concluded the case on Saturday in a review of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to build the defendant's 29-year-old movements, Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from various mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, which contradicted his previous statements, according to reports from The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he had lied because his truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated that it was only a week ago that they knew each other.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to pass to the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip-Hop?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative view of the genre.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims that hip-hop has separated itself from its origins with political messages and social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and put hip-hop in fashion again.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NEW YORK (AP) — New York City Mayor sues couple for break-up after "racist" message
A New York mayor has denounced a couple for discriminatory treatment after receiving a misdirected text message from her mother protesting that she was "another black person."
The couple denies that they are racist and compare the demand with an “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay at seeing that the new manager, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at work on the first day in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOO Another Black Person," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her pipe, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman greeted Ms. Maurice, claiming that the maid she had met, who was African-American, had done her job badly and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received the corresponding payment on her working day and was then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice claims the couple compensation for the settlement and asks for compensation of approximately $350 a day for the six-month-old job they had hired her for, although there was no contract.
“I want to show you that you can’t do things like that,” he told the Post Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have responded to statements that they are racists all claiming that Maurice’s acquiescence was the most reasonable, as they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after she was offended.
“My wife sent him something she didn’t want to say.
He's not racist.
We are not racist people,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have been gossiping, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on."
Plasco, who has compared the lawsuit to an “extortion,” said his wife had two months left to have a baby and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to pursue something like this?
It’s not a very friendly attitude,” the investor banker added.
The legal case has not yet been resolved and the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media and condemn their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared that readers would not identify with a talking bone, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said in connection with the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who links it for the first time before its publication.
It’s very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before having the inspiration to write the children's book on a small teddy bear, was optimistic about the book's rejection. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "agonizing", after his passing.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and states that his father was very proud of the success he had finally achieved.
"He was a discreet man; he was not a presumptuous," he said.
“But, as Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when your son gets something: you’re proud, even if it’s not your thing.
I think he considered Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always recognized Paddington’s own merit.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye by phone
Upon landing, they took their daughter to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked hard to save his life.
"Nad called frequently to say that it was very serious and they did not expect me to overcome it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I called Nad and he told me that he would die in the next two minutes and that he had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs that had given him so that his body would continue beating were being consumed and were coming out of his system.
He had died before what was expected and so everything was gone.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and more people.
I had to keep in good shape.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, a district of the experience that was going on.
“No one knew,” he said.
“I had a headache and the tears didn’t stop falling.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a sense of sympathy for Nad clappering.
The feeling that I needed my love and understanding.
I know I wanted her very much.”
Dolby women hold cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent other people from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call to receive assistance.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, at the age of 18, was killed.
“I don’t want any father or mother to feel what I have to feel every day,” he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that their smile could light up any room.”
However, he left his job before dying because he was at a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly concerned that there is a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people who can go to, who can listen, even if it's a friend.
Don’t be silent; you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies's for years, lost her partner Mark for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother's death.
“He never said he wasn’t feeling well or depressed or anything like that,” he said.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change of attitude.
He played hard on Christmas Day, when the kids opened their presents and he didn’t look them in the eyes or anything.”
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to work it out: “Open a hole in the family.
It's destroying us.
We have to keep fighting and fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future looms as FBI investigates
“I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with limited scope and time), we could get some unity,” Mr. Flake said Saturday. He also added that he feared the committee would be destroyed with the root death point of the supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
There are only five weeks left for the November 6 midterm elections. If, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, they will be weakened in order to get the man they want out elected to come to the main court of the country.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call senators and pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as she was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where, at present, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to clear the fourth and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of deserters 'cautious' with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 deserts had been produced last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said strict border controls between North Korea and China and the rise in prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
Normally, the vast majority of North Korean deserters are offered South Korean nationality.
Seoul sources claim that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal migrant deserters, instead of refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on denuclearization talks.
This happened after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they generally agreed to work to achieve a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign affairs minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in these circumstances, we will not disarm ourselves first unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Says Brett Kavanaugh Is A “Historic” and Not Able to Work at the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh is a "historic" and that his temperament makes him unable to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman acted this way, they would have told her it was a ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said in relation to her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied allegations of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes screaming and speechless as he talked about his family and his years at the institute.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats and said the charges against him were a "gross and coordinated murder of a character" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as he showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if confirmed, and if Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“That’s what I can say: if you don’t tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, you’re not only not able to be in the Supreme Court, but also not in the court where you are now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he evaded questions about whether he would annul certain decisions of the Superior Court.
"It is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the Tribunal and hope that we find it wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise their power.
It is a justified diatribe: months and years of abundant anger and cannot be taken away without crying.
“We’ll cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's too common. And you?"
She continued: “It was very helpful to me a woman who was an executive somewhere who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but that she developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, telling the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m sad.
I'm angry."
And then it continued.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because, basically, they are misinterpreted.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a male majority, where I once ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of a bigger woman (a management cold that had always scared me a little) who grabbed me from the basement and dragged me down.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you are sad and they will rejoice, because they will have you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extramarital adventure on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of presenting herself as a presidential candidate.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me as he reigned 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said to me, "White and the seven dwarfs."
As he arrived late in the campaign, he was backed up by fundraising, so he promised he would not enter the race if he did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters, who donated $1,000 to the men, were only willing to give 250 to her.
“Do you think I have a discount?” she asked.
When he delivered his speech and announced that he would not start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped him, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and for guiding voters, rather than doing it to delegates, and sexism, and anger).
"I might have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder recalled about the press's reaction.
“It could have been thought that my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put in my grave?
"Will you cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The initial rescues from the U.S.-China trade war were deafening and, although it does not appear that the war should end soon, a distancing of countries may prove beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, when he imposed taxes on China’s major exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new arrangements affecting $200 billion worth of products. These arrangements entail a tax on half of all goods arriving in the U.S. from China.
Beijing has repeatedly counterattacked in the same way and has recently raised the tariffs from five to ten percent for US$60 billion in goods.
China has committed to replicating the U.S. and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will be back in the near future.
Making Washington do it back involves giving in to some demands, but leaning publicly in front of the U.S. would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would trigger a fall in any of these countries is far more dangerous than witnesses had predicted,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-centric research associate at the Center for New American Security, a committee of experts.
Syria is ‘prepared’ for refugees to return, according to Foreign Affairs Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a war of more than seven years.
In front of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Affairs Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists demolished to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to be abandoned due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives and their maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime was grateful for any help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that financed the insurgency.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team again won the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, kicked the water out of the hole by 316, giving up the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone in all of his series and became one of the four players who have achieved 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was separated by a 5–4 by the less qualified player of the European team Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t always cry, but today I can’t help it.
It was a very hard year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the drink back.
The team is the most important ... and I’m happy to have been able to help,” commented an excited Garcia after the European victory.
It passes the relief to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four games he had in France and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A statistical oddity for one of the best players who have ever existed, with 14 major titles won and only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled throughout the weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
This morning there was a moment when we pressed the European team.
We fought.
I got my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
The 12 players have played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and progress.
I love these 12 players and am proud to have been their captain.
There's got to be the bar.
He defeats us."
Red tide update: concentrations are reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general reduction in red tide concentrations in certain parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more dispersed proliferation conditions are being reported in the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier areas, suggesting a lower concentration.
The proliferation of the red tide extends along approximately 200 km of coast, from the north of Pinellas to the southern counties of Lee.
Spots can be found 16 km off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places, compared to last week's situation.
The red tide has also been observed in Pasco County.
Average coastal or coastal concentrations have been reported in Pinellas County over the past week, low-to-high concentrations in Hillsborough County, bottom or high concentrations in Manatee County, bottom-to-bottom concentrations in Charlotte County, and bottom-to-bottom concentrations in Charlotte County.
