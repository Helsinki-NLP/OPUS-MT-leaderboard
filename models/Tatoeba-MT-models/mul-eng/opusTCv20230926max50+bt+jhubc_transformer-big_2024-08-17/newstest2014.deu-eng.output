Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
You are not 100 meters away from each other: On Tuesday, in Gutach, the new B 33 foot traffic light was put into operation at the village parking lot - within sight of the older Rathausampel.
Two systems so close to each other: intent or shield citizen strike?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The Rathausampel was installed at the time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights are safe for both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday was important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstra<0xC3><0x9F>e junction area.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the <0xE2><0x80><0xBA>Grub<0xE2><0x80><0xB9> residential area.
“In the case of the high traffic and pedestrians, another traffic light had to be added to their safety,” says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg Landratsamt.
“According to current measurements, on the B 33, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty vehicles,” Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another light bulb is more than necessary: “Safety simply goes ahead here,” says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were conducted, a circular traffic was also considered, but due to the narrowness in the intersection area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstra<0xC3><0x9F>e was again rejected.
According to Arnold, everything was tested in the location selection of the light poles first: "By means of an extra for us with especially long wooden trunks, we have tested whether these vehicles can drive from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without turning the light poles".
The approximately 15,000 euro light bulb plant itself is "the most modern thing on the market at the moment," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that shine so brightly that the lights can be recognized by the drivers, for example, even in the event of a deep rising sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three light systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technique of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian presses the light switch, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, it will immediately turn green for the pedestrian, if not, it will take about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
“If a group or people with disabilities go over the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be safe on the road,” Arnold said.
Of course, the driver has to think here as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly showed the light for pedestrians green, a top-class vehicle sounded through - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the languagelessness, the hustle and bustle of violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - have often been described by the Carinthia poet.
The B<0xC3><0xBC>chner Prize winner is best known as a prose writer, theatre texts are rare in his work.
For his performance "Weather lights on the tip of the tongue", which can now be seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz, a collage of prose texts is therefore composed.
The playwright combines elements from the autobiographically imprinted novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, seine familie belauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important requirement: a crumpled sofa, on which it is supposedly copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs itself through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overwhelms the cast with a wealth of directing hits, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic play forms.
Especially the actresses come up with some questionable stage implementations at times.
They are touched hard, submerged with their heads under water, tacked to the wall with their evening droopies.
Forced into cellophane or mold, they stagger to dangerously high stakes through the staging, either monologize loud or lie completely muted on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly communicates in this stressed way.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the range ranges from deep purple to folk song.
Only towards the end does the twisted performance come to rest, and Winkler’s subsequent absurd humor flares up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that takes place in the dashboard of each car.
The devices, which record every mile driven and report the information to the authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the U.S. planning offices to overhaul the outdated system for financing U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly unleashed an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and advocate that the government can use the small boxes to record the miles they were driven – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax rulings.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while one cannot agree on a move in Congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system where drivers pay per mile driven over the next ten years.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we’ll only be able to use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of Southern California’s Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the mileage of all California drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from taxes, is struggling to pay Americans at the threshold.
But in America, there is no longer as much tanking as before.
Cars consume less fuel.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocents per litre) has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by a cent at high spray prices.
“The gas tax is simply not future-proof,” said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with travel desks to test a mileage-based payment system.
“This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term,” he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as a mileage-based user fee.
It’s no surprise that the idea comes up in urban liberals, because the tax could, for example, be used to influence driving behaviour in a way that reduces congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases.
The California planners focus on the system in the development of strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally anchored climate change goals.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees the most common long-term alternative in it.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation have also come up with the idea of letting drivers pay for the route back.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” says Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in a 2011 report called on Congress to move towards mileage-based billing.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and thus responded to the concerns of MPs from rural areas who represent people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Several states and major cities still do not move on their own in this direction.
The most engaged is Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees to the state instead of the mineral oil tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering such a thing.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, to which the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) are now investigating how to implement the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical that the government could track any of their movements.
“Thinking about Big Brother and stuff like that was a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
Following the test, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the drivers into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, cumbersome technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data about the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the miles driven, but not exactly when and where.
So, according to Khan, the public would also be more calm.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company was not originally set up to help federal states in taxing motorists.
Rather, their goal was to set foot in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay based on the miles driven.
But the devices they test are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programs have made big mistakes.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of options.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don’t choose a device at all and instead pay a package fee based on the average miles traveled by all residents of the state.
Other agencies hope to be able to sell the concept to a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more features than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxing device that also allows parking fees to be paid, insurance only has to be paid for miles driven and speed data collected from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.
“Car drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits that the system offers,” says a planning document from the city.
However, some traffic planners wonder if the whole thing about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction maneuver.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said Congress could easily solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising fuel taxes.
An additional one-off fee or annual fee could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is enough,” explains Randy Rentschler, head of legislation and public affairs at the Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
K<0xC3><0xB6>nigsfeld: Small team wakes up
The volunteer fire department managed their autumn head sample despite staff shortages with bravery.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property spring in Burgberger Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in his exercise acceptance.
There is supposed to be a short circuit in the sawing.
Two people were injured due to the fire and the development of smoking, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two air defencemen of the army prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, it managed to find the first person and lead them out.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with an integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw bales in it.
Furthermore, there were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first detonation was carried out via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was made via an overflow hydrant at a distance of about 100 meters.
Now, three deletion attacks could be created.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also went to show during the exercise what is to be done with little available staff.
In the event of an emergency, support will be provided through the K<0xC3><0xB6>nigsfeld Day Task Force.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies is important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, President Guido Wolf also made it clear in Titisee-Neustadt where the workers of tomorrow come from.
In the Hochschwarzwald Support Centre, he followed this important question together with the managing school leaders of the vocational schools as well as the district gymnasium and the parents’ advisory chairmen.
“Education is an important location factor,” said Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, which presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed with the model projects for the training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful collaboration in the wooded city between the funding centre, the district gymnasium and the vocational school centre.
In addition, he praised the family friendliness in the county.
“It’s important not only to look at the family phase, but also because of the demographic change in the care of family members,” Wolf said.
In addition, he said that more and more employees were taking care of the care and care of their relatives.
“Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship,” Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose skilled workers, he said.
Another, especially important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, often retain the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the President of the Landtag was convinced.
Because only if adequate training places were offered can the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made to expand public passenger transport.
“Stay persistent and make sure that public transport is getting better,” he told the address of the local politicians present at the meeting.
Enjoy a fun afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dieting seniors to coffee, cake and then to a vesper.
In the past, older citizens were recruited to the restroom.
In the meantime, this afternoon takes place in the nursing home of St. Joseph.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich performed with popular melodies.
The 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front boundary of the old schoolyard to the church street, which is before the renovation, is to be put back on the renovation cost plan of the city of Br<0xC3><0xA4>unlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angular wall was installed during the first works of the renovation of the front schoolyard, for stabilization and static relief of the one hundred-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The next step is to involve Alexander Misok of the Br<0xC3><0xA4>unlinger Stadtbauamt, the Landesdenkmalamt in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation is to be made by experts, which is then to be put on the table to the municipal council to decide and determine the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made as early as next year.
After the renovation, plastering and planting of the old school yard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the remedial boundary wall must be renovated from the ground up and put on new under construction in the foreseeable future.
The historic one-hundred-year-old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard to the church street is mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, is in need of renovation and has an arched inclination to the front.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, however, the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A more stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which is done by the current fastening works.
Originally, the schoolyard renovation was planned in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures brought a shift.
An important word in the historic refurbishment of the school walls, which has already been used for filming, will be the Landesdenmmalamt.
If the specifications come from this side, then the city of Br<0xC3><0xA4>unlingen hopes for grants from the memorial guards.
The students of the Br<0xC3><0xA4>unlinger primary school, who are now being taught again in a well-refurbished old school building with a new classroom, can soon use the old schoolyard.
<0xC3><0x96>zdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart
Cem <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has also joined the ongoing discussions about the future of the music universities in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
"I think it's wrong to give up integral education at the Stuttgart University of Music," <0xC3><0x96>zdemir told the Stuttgarter Nachrichten.
Jazz and classical music are part of the jazz scene in Stuttgart.
This contradicts <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, who is in Stuttgart as a favorite for a direct mandate in the federal election on 22 September, the Green-Red state government.
Based on an expert study, it forces a reorganization of the five music universities in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
After that, the study programme Jazz and Pop will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
U.S. border: 'Super-Tunnel' discovered for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the US, investigators have discovered and shut down a “super-tunnel” for drug smuggling.
The more than 500-meter-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rails and an ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
The tunnel had not yet been put into use, according to the data.
“These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar,” Laura Duffy, a U.S. attorney general for Southern California, told a news conference outside a warehouse in San Diego, where the end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Turning to the drug gangs, Duffy said: “If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we’re determined to turn that into a huge waste of your dirty money.”
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against the drug cartel.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Due to the tunnel’s elaborate equipment, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side is the access in a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a conductor leads 20 meters into the depth of the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would have also been appropriate to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine discovery.
The third, a Mexican, was caught because of the seized marijuana.
All three men are facing life-long deprivation of liberty, officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, it was reported at the San Diego press conference.
This is the first time that cocaine has been found in a tunnel.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the “desperation” of drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug trap in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were disclosed to the detainees, at least one of them was Mexican, it said.
You must expect up to 10 years in prison.
2014 will be the year of Geisinger
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
If the year ends in a good eight weeks, the anniversary year is up.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in 794.
In churches, a certificate was made in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15, there is supposed to be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this start event takes place in the place where the two were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be on a festive weekend in July from 18 to 20 July 1250.
Celebrating again.
On Friday with a feast, on Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this festive weekend is also the Church-Hausener Kirchenfest.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On the 21st of June, together with the solstice of the Black Forest Club, on the 12th of July in the arena with fireworks and on the 13th of December as the first concert of urban music in the new festival hall.
It will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary, a new chronicle will also be published.
“But it should not only be a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the Geisingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen,” said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also today’s Geisingen celebrates 2014’s birthday, 1974 the present space was completed with the entrances.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
2014 is also another year with many anniversaries.
The Strohglonki craze begins on 8 February with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the harmony Gutmadingen turns 90 and has the festive banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the music club Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, for the first time in 764.
The certificate was made in churches (houses) that were court at the time.
Therefore, both municipalities are mentioned in the same document.
The reason for celebrating this 1250-year-old in 2014, in addition to the municipal reform is 40 years ago.
Council takes rail systems to the target
Should the rail crossing "Am Hirschen" be converted in an expensive way to increase road safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
For this, the shield roof must take in 220 000 euros.
The Deutsche Bahn aims to improve the Kinzigtal railway line in the coming year.
In particular, the safety of rail crossings should be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout the country.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they will have to take part in the costs with one third, the rest will be shared by the railways and the federation.
Schiltach’s town builder Roland Grie<0xC3><0x9F>haber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the railway crossing “Am Hirschen”.
There, the city plans to build a bulge at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks.
Larger vehicles, such as those that transport longwood, could also be in reverse traffic without having to block the track.
Grie<0xC3><0x9F>haber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could widen the subsequent road at a given time in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils called into question the need for a road distribution: Thomas Kipp, in his statement, brought the opinion of critics to the point: "Do we have to take in so much money because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The rail crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long-haul transports.
Even wood from the area "Kuhbach" is partially transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route on the H<0xC3><0xA4>berlesbr<0xC3><0xBC>cke because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Since the Kirchberg tunnel and the Schlossberg tunnel should be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the transition to the railway "Am "Hirschen" could also be important for a longer period of time.
The Councils agreed to investigate what costs would cause the proposed widening of the road.
Despite this, the reconstruction of the railway crossing was mostly agreed with the fact that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city can expand the subsequent road in the direction of "Bahnhofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e", if necessary, for meeting traffic to around 5.5 meters.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could be a very different problem, which concerns access to the "Geroltzh<0xC3><0xA4>user Weg".
The administration had been able to investigate the conversion plans of the railway from the engineering office of Breinlinger, as she had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzh<0xC3><0xA4>user Weg would be possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it should not be ruled out that the inclination conditions of the road could cause longer vehicles to sit.
In turn, the city was responsible for this as a road construction contractor.
Therefore, the conversion can result in liability disputes.
Since both the timber removal and the bending in the current state of expansion worked, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway transition, Haas argued.
Also, at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than that of the other train crossings, because it is located directly next to the centre of the stop, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be braked at this point already so that no collision threatens.
The majority refused to approve the conversion of this railway crossing, as the city of Schiltach would have to "explore" the problem with sitting vehicles, according to the councils, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction works.
As unproblematic, the board considers the conversions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which cross-border agreements have already been made with the railway.
Esa Decides on Big Space Missions: Missions for Billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the coming years.
30 proposals were to be selected, five are still in the race.
distant worlds.
More than 1,000 planets with other stars have already been found by astronomers.
Whether there is life on at least some of them, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: should one look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or hunt for Earth-like planets and thus perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These are the questions posed by the European Space Agency (ESA).
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are designed to advance research decisively.
The state for such "L-missions" in each case amounts to approximately one billion euros.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 Ideas were debated, five of them have now come to the narrower choice.
Numerous bodies reviewed the proposals, hooking up with the researchers.
In the coming days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions have been selected by the ESA, to which the missions of the 2007 initiated program "Cosmic Vision" should find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds – and thus the formation of planets orbiting these stars – are still in the verbal darkness.
A large infrared telescope in the universe could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can life arise there?
To address this question, the space telescope “Cheops” is set to launch in 2017, with which 500 already-known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity will be explored in more detail.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could image Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an index of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
Finally, this question should also provide an explanation as to what conditions there are for the creation of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation emanating from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be studied by way of example.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a M-class mission (that is where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and accurately observe the sun’s surface and activity.
Jupiter and its moon are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the ESA plans the first of three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The probe "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is to explore the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europa, Kallisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there.
There may also be discrepancies that could lead physicists to a new theory under whose roof all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and where does it come from?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the hurricane.
In addition to the matter we are familiar with, from the stars, planets, and beings like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of seconds of the hurricane, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the Esa has already approved an M-Mission here, which is scheduled to launch in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is to study the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus enabling conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, the best chances for approval as an L-Mission has "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
Physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to date.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope, behind the project.
The mission includes a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
It could also prove gravitational waves, as opposed to Earth’s facilities, that were created at the time of the crash, and thus provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four more proposals are still competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, among other things, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background, and "Ex" on the surface of the planet.
Proposals have already been made, among other things, for the sample-return transport from Mars, for the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as for solar physics.
Snowden ready to “cooperate” with Germany in terms of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. Secret Service, has said he is willing to travel to Berlin and say before the German Bundestag if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he received asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele, he writes: “Even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a breach of trust and does not attempt to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the U.S. government to drop the charge against him.
The indictment, filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to enable that.”
Relations between the U.S. and Germany are strained by claims the NSA has intercepted the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said that one should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if this is possible, “without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States.”
Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele, a Greens MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden on his Twitter feed.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele said that according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden speaks in Germany, then he needs a guarantee that he is “safe” there, the MP said.
Snowden explains in his letter that he is exposed to a “serious and ongoing” campaign of persecution that has driven him out of his home.
However, he was touched by the worldwide response to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an unchecked system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden made the German authorities an offer of cooperation “when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation were resolved”.
Frontier Airlines charges charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to $100 from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday was read that passengers should keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who only paid on the flight path.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate this amount,” she said.
In 2008, airlines began to charge for the first and second checked-in baggage allowance.
Passengers who tried to circumvent these have therefore been stuck in hand luggage as much as possible, resulting in the luggage compartments being often filled above the seat.
Fees are a way to move passengers to take less on board.
O’Malley said the new fee isn’t really about making money.
It’s about Frontier’s most loyal customers, who would have clearly expressed that it’s getting harder and harder to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who purchase your tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on the Frontier flight path may be allowed to take a piece of luggage for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O’Malley stated that Frontier’s website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed about the fee before they got on the flight.
Frontier’s new hand luggage fee only comes into effect in the summer, there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often skimp on baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that transporting luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they want it.
Many on Wall Street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of flight travel after years of losses.
However, most of them have so far left the fingers of fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. claimed first hand luggage charges three years ago and later followed Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airliner.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely monitoring the additional charges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s hand luggage fee would bring in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit and was curious what to expect on the flight path if passengers were faced with the company’s unusual hand luggage charge.
“The boarding process was one of the most tireless I have experienced in my career in aviation,” he said.
I expected to see toothpaste and hand-held discussions on the flight path.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding was running like greased.”
Frontier also follows Spirit at the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the entire can and coffee will be refilled for free.
Water is still free.
U.S. Airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks in 2008, but did so again seven months later after complaining about passengers and no other large company had been sought.
Frontier’s move to charge for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative with which customers should be directed to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to direct shopping with them instead of via an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the long way in this area.
In September, when booking via an online travel agency, the company began to donate only half as many multi-plane miles.
On Wednesday, the miles were cut to 25 percent of the route.
For this reason, a flight with a border of more than 1000 miles booked with a third-party provider only takes customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when buying directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base based in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue declined by 9 percent and air capacity shrunk by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as can be seen in the financial report released by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., on Wednesday.
As part of the sale of the company, Republic has tried to get the finances of Frontier.
Words come from the Bible
About 40 women visited this year’s last women’s breakfast in the evangelical church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the church house was "Words from the Bible" and "Words from the Middle Ages".
Zita K<0xC3><0xB6>hler, the chairman of the church council, attended a lecture on biblical proverbs after breakfast.
“Words contain vitalities, regulations, or warnings,” she said.
She compared several proverbs to the corresponding Bible verses and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like: “Wooden eyes be vigilant, as sheds fall from the eyes, toss an eye on someone, to give his hands to the Lord in sleep, to wash his hands in innocence.”
On several occasions, the speaker also advised her listeners on what word of mouth it was.
The sayings of the Middle Ages were adopted by Christel Dehner, the church councilwoman: All good things are three, make blue, make a little deafening.
She explained the meaning and origin of the speeches, which she called "bridges to the past".
In the end, a Tombola was released.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round was Mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployment: pilot project for Ungelernte in tourism
At the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte, a pilot project for the tourism industry started.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as apprentices in the industry will be qualified as professionals for hotels and restaurants over the course of three winters.
“New is that the six-month courses end with degrees,” said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg employment agency.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would get trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also includes the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gast<0xC3><0xA4>ttenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA says an “internal mistake” and not a hacker is to blame for the website’s crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a bug had shut down its public website for several hours and not hackers, as claimed online.
“NSA.gov was unavailable tonight for a few hours as an internal error occurred during a scheduled update,” the spy agency said in an emailed message.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early hours of the evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not reachable for at least six hours and this is still not available for some users.
Earlier, a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “in no way compromised.”
Secret information is not in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have hijacked the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former supersecret NSA, whose nickname was once No Search Agency (No such authority), is now in the public light and is seen after the disclosures made known in recent months about its extensive surveillance program in the home and abroad have been sharply criticized by the NSA, the NSA’s resultat
The growing controversy surrounding the intelligence service sparked initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of people without jobs dropped slightly in October from 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate is 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, “we would have hoped for more,” says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy managing director of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
Because so far, many companies have responded to attitudes.
One reason for this is according to Felder-Bauer: "We have hardly any skilled workers in the craft, in the health care and in old age care".
Due to the season, since September there have also been job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry.
The winter season begins in mid-December.
The full background report can be found in the Allg<0xC3><0xA4>u bulletin of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Losses on profits at Bombardier after decline in delivery payments and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday after it was under pressure from falling orders and deliveries on third-quarter aircraft as well as contract issues in the rail sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could enter commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
So far, only three more launches have followed the test aircraft’s maiden flight a month and a half ago, making it appear questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a price crash of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered his rating from “outperform” to “sector perform” in view of the fact that the stock has limited exchange potential in the next one to two quarters.
“While lower delivery rates were expected for aircraft, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector,” Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to be more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew after months of delays for the first time in September.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, as potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and pledges from 15 customers and companies.
Pierre Beaudoin, CEO, is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
The management of the company also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was on schedule.
"The test aircraft has not stayed on the ground any longer than expected," Beaudoin said at a telephone conference, adding that the ground tests and software updates had been set during the aircraft's service life.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then add a revision period, which we did.
This happens throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to launch in the coming weeks, the rest shortly after, the company said.
Analysts remain skeptical, however, whether twelve months after the maiden flight the first customer can operate a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier said it will review the start-up planning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow progress of the flight test – even if it obviously corresponds to Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ending September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share from $172 million or 9 cents per share the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue declined slightly and fell from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order stock in the aerospace sector was $32.9 billion on September 30, and was unchanged from December 31.
“In the field of aerospace, the results were within our specifications, but the low order intake and market conditions overall were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector have risen by nearly 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion.
The volume of orders in the transport sector was $32.6 billion on September 30 and was therefore slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the field of transport has been affected by handling problems in some large contracts.
According to management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, Bombardier’s share fell by 8.5 percent and was at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that Google’s chief financial officer Patrick Pichette would switch to the board.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest rival, reported a ten percent decline in quarterly earnings on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots on Friday morning (local time) at the LAX airport.
While the airport management via Twitter reported that the gunman was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
U.S. President Barack Obama is constantly being informed about the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3, witnesses said they saw a gunman with a gun in one of the departure halls, as several media reported.
One traveler told CNN that many people had sought protection in panic.
Travelers would have cried and children would have cried.
Panic broke out among the waiting people, many of whom were afraid to hide behind chairs.
He heard two gunshots, says a Los Angeles Times traveller.
An employees of the TSA Security Authority have suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was “like in a movie.”
After that, he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots should have fallen near a safety control area.
Airport Building Evacuated
On television pictures were shown how numerous ambulances and police cars were driving in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were rescued from the building.
Users posted photos on Twitter of a special deployment command and a gun lying on the ground.
As the airport management said on Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, resulted in long backsliding.
Until landings, air traffic had been temporarily suspended, it said.
However, several aircraft were also observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller U.S. airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-independent lawyer, who warned drug lord of police investigation, must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information on underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced by the Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison.
A well-known criminal defenseman who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be discovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into its drug trade activities after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" by criminals, was arrested in his home in 2011 after police had monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine to the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a bar.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests had found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police secured <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool’s Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice.
He admitted to cocaine possession in an earlier survey.
The lawyer was transferred after police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigating officers followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta’s house and put the drugs with a 60 percent purity in a black golf glove under the lawyer’s trash can.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough phoned Ditta regularly, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park for dinner.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was announced that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after being discovered in his hair, wallet and credit card during tests of Class A drugs.
Ditta was later arrested, but declined to take cocaine, saying he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed her discussion was subject to “lawyer secrecy.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police investigation, he stated that he operates an office both under his private address and at the workplace, and clients would call him home for legal matters.
Before the court, it was announced that he had called important actors of the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about them.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, “A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney, as he has overly engaged with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered the police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
As a result, Mr. Ditta brought his professional status into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta pointed out any wrongdoing and claimed, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, then I would not wait 15 hours, but would do so immediately.”
However, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead told police in Lancashire: “Mr. Ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the time he started buying drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to gather valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and trust in the public.
Ditta has abandoned this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
Lancashire’s Serious and Organized Crime Unit led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five more people involved in the drug trade were sentenced to 153 years in prison for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients as attorneys in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and equal opportunity was the motivation for his work.
The Revolutionary Work of Church Music
To conclude the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the song wreath Dunningen will frame two services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock My Life", which excited the audience in the spring of this year, the song wreath will enrich two services with the performance of Franz Schubert's Deutsche Messe at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary Mass will be heard from 19 at the evening Mass at St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 a.m. at the service at St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Songs to celebrate the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The exhibition is presented within the framework of the services of God, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the wind band of the music club Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism seemingly gives way to confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, in the soul care unit Haslach (SE) fundamentals will change.
Then there is only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, M<0xC3><0xBC>hlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
For nothing can be changed in the basic decisions of the diocese, and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the skepticism with regard to the New fades hesitantly, but rather with confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the soul care team were enough.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the newly drafted guidelines for soul care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
Subsequently, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a body of public law, which will enter into the rights and duties of the six individual churches so far.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the parish priest is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, in which six parishes are formed so-called community teams on site.
Their task will be to promote church life in the future.
When asked about the finances of the individual parishes, there was then a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated funds in the parishes remain purpose-bound.
The obligations, on the other hand, are passed on to the entire community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then meets all the parishes, there were great concerns.
“Even in the past, only projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone have been invested,” said Bruno Prinzbach, chairman of Haslach’s parish council.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the soul care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had set themselves the task in 2006 of “One will, five will stay” and had to realize that this is not so easy at all.
The committees of the Haslacher Soulsorge unit then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The drafts will be concreted in further meetings and decided in a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the spring.
In the end, parish councillor Michael Sch<0xC3><0xB6>ner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Soul Care Unit, which was approved with a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorfs have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the municipal works, J<0xC3><0xB6>rg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the S<0xC3><0x9C>DKURIER, a four-headed Pfullendorfer family will increase costs from 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG envelope from 5,277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This circulation is re-established every year in October by the four operators of the large power lines.
These refer to the additional costs incurred by them from the energy transition, which they can charge by a conversion above the electricity price.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The Supervisory Board of the energy company had even assumed a higher turnover in its forecasts, as J<0xC3><0xB6>rg-Arne Bias reports.
Now, the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the townships could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're going to go for an increase of 1 cent plus x," Bias said, with the number going to be closer to 2 cents.
Lamp on permanent red: pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a light bulb just doesn’t turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not react, or the light signal is defective.
What should you do - drive at Red?
If an affected person has waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free, he can proceed, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "appropriate", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to hold on for at least five minutes before dealing with a malfunction of the bulb.
However, those who continue the journey in spite of red light must be clear that they bear the full blame for an accident caused by it.
Anyone who has less than five minutes of patience may not wait long enough, Becker warns, referring to a decision of the Hamm Supreme Court.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes of red, a driver had ignored the light bulb and had to be responsible for a negligent red light failure.
The light bulb was not defective, but went green a short time later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - the fine, however, did not.
The City Council is pleased with a solid budget
Whenever it comes to public meetings about the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal pocket in Herdwangen-Sch<0xC3><0xB6>nach is well filled and the administration has not been aware of debt since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can also be booked as a full success in this sense.
This was evident in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros was over one million euros higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget was also about EUR 1.8 million, around EUR 1 million above the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and to the municipal share of income tax.
Also, the asset budget was again clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5 million, it was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.5 million last year.
“This is essentially due to the higher supply from the administrative budget,” says Rothmund.
As fewer investments have been made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the supply of reserves has also been higher.
Overall, the overall balance could be increased by around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.1 million to a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
“You don’t just shake a piece like that out of your sleeve,” Gerster praised with a view to the annual report.
He and the city council were visibly pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good numbers that citizens could soon come to stand for expensive.
Due to the good financial situation, in the past the municipality was able to dispense with high leverages.
However, according to Gerster, subsidies from the country have already been reduced more often.
There are prerequisites for these grants from various compensating poles.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must show certain leverages.
“We need to look at the issue of leverage, as investments are expected in the coming years, for which we would like to have grants,” Gerster said in a statement.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter has been in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60 as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s history at the men’s singing club C<0xC3><0xA4>cilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood on the stage as usual in the colors of his men's singing club.
Even after 60 years, singing with the now-loved choir is still a lot of fun.
Wermter was also active in the club, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
He immediately received several awards for his commitment and association: J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Kohr, pastoral speaker on behalf of the C<0xC3><0xA4>cilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and one signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince Ebriren.
His singing colleagues handed him the certificate of the German Choral Association as well as a engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honor, the 31st autumn festival took place in the usual tracks: with the MGV Betra, the song wreath Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had loaded a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Funny, her brothers".
The singer Hubert Wermter was given a little stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The male singer Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "hunting" by Julius Wengert, "far, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you pass through the valley".
The song wreath Salzstetten provided the women's quota of the festival with his mixed choir and his women's group - the "pulse choir".
The mixed choir took "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus to foreign countries, while the "Impulse choir" also relied on foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back with "What is the Schwob?" by Hans S<0xC3><0xBC>ssmuth and Robert Papert's "Bierlied" back into local fields, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical graduation.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" aka Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children did well over lunch.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and kindergartens in the Zollernalbkreis get mail these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Zollernalb Sparkasse, Schwarzwalder Bote wants to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and decoration wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day care centres and nursery rinks from the entire customs district can participate in the action.
If you have a construction or decoration request for your facility, you can apply with this at the Black Forest booth.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Kindergarten construction site.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Schwarzw<0xC3><0xA4>lder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with building materials of a maximum value of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to take care of many diligent builders.
What does it have to do with the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Zollernalb savings fund.
It will be delivered to the Kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outrages over controversial media law
“We are in a frightening situation and you may ask yourself: What does Parliament think about simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?” was read in the newspaper, which considers the bill unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punishing and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is an extended arm of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament,” he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government takes the new law "the media effectively into a snag", whereas The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya would have suffered "a heavy blow", and called the draft "draconical".
The passing of the law is part of a series of measures to strengthen national security in response to attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping center in September.
The Kenyan media angered the authorities because they released footage of security cameras that showed how the units that were sent to the scene allegedly robbed the luxury shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded to the inquiry with the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative, even though the complaint was withdrawn after a media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to a million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “already a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper is of the opinion that these measures could have a devastating impact on Kenya’s “living blogosphere” in its description.
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation who described Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
“If you leave politicians to themselves, they’ll take the country into bankruptcy and bring us back to the time of hunters and collectors,” he said.
Kenyan legislators have already in the past raised public concerns.
In May, they agreed to cancel the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and re-enforced their defensible salaries of some 532,000 shillings tax-free per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-D<0xC3><0xBC>rrheim: A dream come true for FC
Despite the cold weather and the rain, the official opening ceremony for the Kunstrasensportplatz was not a big deal on the importance of the city and the football club.
Everyone had wished for a more pleasant hour of celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play.
So all those who came without umbrella or could not keep one for any reason.
This was the case for the musicians who framed the festival, as well as for some speakers.
That’s why we also became FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke about the fulfillment of a dream.
First of all, his thanks were to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who had a strong commitment to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the members of the association who contributed.
Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rusty pensioners laid 400 square meters of plaster stones for the new roads.
This remarkable volunteer engagement was also appreciated by the Landtag Member Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were given to the city sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South-Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation to the club’s youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that ever-recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original lawn pitch so that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first considerations to solve the problem when the construction of a third place was planned at the site of the football club or at the real school at Salinensee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, ideas arose for the construction of an artificial turf sports field, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were made two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpakt, pledged a cost contribution of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000 for the construction of the site and approved the country funding of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>104,000.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>356,000 to the total cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560,000, Klumpp summarised.
The construction of the 68-foot 108-metre artificial turf was started on June 4.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike route.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on internal and judicial issues.
To this end, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, parliamentary intimidation and the federal police.
In the morning, the Migration and Integration Working Group also wanted to continue its consultations.
This should include, among other things, the subject of dual citizenship, in which both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the force for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the issue of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD confirmed its refusal to become a car tout required by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for multi-carrying and thus ecologically counterproductive", the SPD negotiating leader for the topic of transport, Florian Pronold, explained in a letter to his faction.
There was a threat of evacuation on land roads, which are already the focus of accidents.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step from Pronold’s point of view.
"There is a risk that at a later time the compensation for Germans will be deleted," he said.

Driver seriously injured in an accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to police, a 41-year-old man from M<0xC3><0xBC>sch was travelling towards Grefrath with his car on the camper outer ring around 9:15 p.m.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. T<0xC3><0xB6>niser Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, she turned over the car of the 37-year-old.
The driver's eyes collided.
The Aachen suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Closure after accident at Sch<0xC3><0xA4>nzlekreisel
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., was driving out of town on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
Shortly before the roundabout at Sch<0xC3><0xA4>nzle, he noticed that he was on the left slope track in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and switched to the right lane.
There was a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanz.
A 19-year-old VW Passat driving behind the BMW was also damaged.
A total of around 15,000 Sachs injuries occurred, police said.
The road had to be closed during the accident, it said.
Vienna Airport makes passenger calls to the airport
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will be no more traffic at Vienna-Schwechat airport in the future.
A large part of the loudspeaker throughput is thus eliminated - the noise level should be reduced so clearly.
To create a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Wien, the Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the setting of percepts concerning individuals.
For example, airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already giving up on the noisy calls.
With the removal of these passages – on average, about 200 personal calls by the speakers in a day – it is expected to approach the airport more quietly in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual passages have been relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about changed flight climbs or departure times go a bit down here," Kleemann said in a conversation with the radio station.
Highlander games on the Kaltehof
In addition to the tractor brakes, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they have grown Swabian on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters are measured in the disciplines of tree trunk throwers, hoof throwers and water bucket bearers.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
“It doesn’t matter at all,” says organiser Peter Saile.
The stem must be dropped vertically, should be folded once and then come to lie down.
This is assessed with most points.
When it comes to hooves, it depends on the target accuracy.
From eight meters away is thrown on a pflock.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in carrying water buckets over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, then two may participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
You can train as early as 10 a.m.
Suitable clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in the scottish skirt.
Swabian trachea is also allowed.
For the "outfit", the jury gives a few bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swiss Highlander games and the tractor-pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action has already been taken on the mainland on Saturday.
In the evening, music lovers come at their own expense.
At 7 p.m., the birab<0xC3><0xB6>hmische Blasmusik from Sch<0xC3><0xB6>mberg will form the great evening of entertainment.
The chapel plays a fleet of Polkas and Marshes.
But their repertoire also includes sensitive rollers and a saturate big-band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black sausage baron, will be among the runners.
In Dornhan, he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the crazy soup.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten hosts breakfast, from 2 pm the peasant chapel B<0xC3><0xB6>ffingen is a guest, and the "oldies" then let the party ring out.
Starting on Friday is the Stoppelackerparty with DJ Ralf.
Other programme points include the Oldtimer and Schlepper Meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions of companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sundays include the Maislabyrinth, the craft market and sheep shearing.
Specially for children there is a barbeque zoo, straw hut castle, tractor riding (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
Organizers are the multipurpose hall, the ski club and the tractor friends "Z<0xC3><0xBC>ndk<0xC3><0xA4>psele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk, and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant hemp, for example, is a quartz set.
Furthermore, the Federation of Vegetarians calls World Vegan Day on November 1.
On the occasion of World Vegan Day on November 1, the Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a series of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt lets be replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Retractable plant saws replace conventional impact saws.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
For example, half a crushed, ripe banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple cider vinegar or one tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
For example, loose dough instead of eggs with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soy yoghurt or seidentofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to Vebu, about 800,000 people in Germany currently eat vegan, i.e. purely plant-based.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of Black Forest High School got to know the American capital of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it immediately went to the Brooklyn Bridge, through which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached on foot.
There was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time delay, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but faithful to the motto "The city does not sleep" the day was decided at Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, on the second day, the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then it went over the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial site of September 11.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating big city from the 373-meter-high viewing platform of the Empire State Building.
Then it went through the hustle and bustle of the New York streets across the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience school day at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, a Hubertus fair will be held on the day of St. Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on H<0xC3><0xBC>lsbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
St. Hubertus was the story of a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of L<0xC3><0xBC>ttich.
The hunting horn blowing group of the hunter-gatherer Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth music on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood It) according to old, originally French melodies.
The blowers wear riding clothes, because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog mutts on tow-hunting musically.
The mass will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed storage room shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to Lexikon, Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In case of a visit to the café of the same name at the store in the district town of Kleve in the field of vision to the Rhein-Waal University, it does not have to stay at the pure Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu feeling.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that to its goal: to make an actual stay not only memorable, but also hand-fast and experienceable over and over again.
Because it's just fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner life of the store 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first glance.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel B<0xC3><0xBC>ttner at the top pampers the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail options.
For this there are delicious cakes or individually coated fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the beautiful café at the store as a gastronomist: in Kranenburg they ran the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve to the store, the friendly café lovers hope for more audience.
And last but not least, through college.
“We don’t have a specific target group,” stresses Daniel B<0xC3><0xBC>ttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address as much as seniors and all ages between them.
About Cafe-Lover.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most varied variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel B<0xC3><0xBC>ttner is more of an expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker.
“A baguette – that’s my thing,” she tells the NRZ.
There were also two events in the light café.
Better say one.
Because the port festival took place rather outside - the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu did not take advantage of it.
But there was also the ring night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds said.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps that is why Daniel B<0xC3><0xBC>ttner is not a fan of event-events: "You can't do it all right."
And with an event I always only speak to those who are also interested in the special event.
Therefore, events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible."
Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the store in Kleve.
The road that is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many cliques, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastromile and thus also the Café Déj<0xC3><0xA0> Vu for themselves.

A day of gratitude at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival that the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the clubhouse of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious cooperation in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is also always the appropriate festival to make honors.
The special award "Singer of the Year" was given to writer Rolf Wagener.
"You not only wrote a lot for us, but you also made some rounds for us, for our heartfelt thanks," said the choir's chairman Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir samples by means of activity noises went to the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participations this year, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "Singer of the Year" 42.
Placed five-pointed Notenwart Artur Br<0xC3><0xBC>ckner.
A special thank you was given to the team of club host Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had magically created a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets at its regular choir rehearsals every Tuesday at 19.45 in the club venue.
"New happy voices are always welcome," says Schlotmann.
UN announces new goals in the fight against poverty
The United Nations is starting right now with the development of a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) announced 12 years ago to combat poverty.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro on the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 Millennium Development Goals.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world political leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to “think beyond national interests.”
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to take up a process with which universal, sustainable development goals should be agreed,” he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to realize our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Development Goals."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been out of the game for four days, the handball top scorer still has a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated on the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
“I don’t even know how a victory tastes like that anymore,” Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Although the third-league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet cleared any trees, Malmon raises his index finger in advance.
I have trained a lot of players in my youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
“In addition, we have to wait to see if there is any reinforcement from the first one,” explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to past performances.
Above all things in the cover work and in the switch-over game, the last time it was huge.
The use of opportunities also definitely needs to be improved.
Therefore, I hope that my players have finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, to voice calls for peace in a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
Fearing for the country’s future, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday at the capital’s Independence Square.
For the past two weeks, there have been nearly daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fighting since the peace deal over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by White-ruled Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will fall back into an enlarged conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
For the fast-growing economy, much is at stake, as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring investments of more than $50 billion in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US into the country.
The ruling Frelimo Party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, on October 17.
The attacks on the previous rebels escalated as government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, Renamos told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
Speaking to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama viewed himself as a “loser” who “want to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can force the government to make his decisions.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid a war.
However, concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying, Renamo is resigning from the 1992 peace agreement.
He explained to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
“Our vision is to resume negotiations, but seriously,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of tensions that have been fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
“We have here two grown men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already said she will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by a crippling movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo’s electoral success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, which was founded by a former Renamo member of the Movimento Democr<0xC3><0xA1>tico de Mo<0xC3><0xA7>ambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation comes when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but she has carried out disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but Beira is located, using the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga replied with restraint to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
“Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has further increased frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been worried about corruption, the sluggish progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
“Nobody is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again,” he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “examples for life,” according to one author.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal force has no chance against clever tricks,” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are “far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools,” which is why Crossley-Holland advocated for a “careful selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that with authors and teachers who are "excessively didactic", children would be "completely turned off", because in entertaining stories the messages would be "intrusive".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children lies in the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
It must be subtly represented, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof again
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob took his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years were spent in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely short-lived stage play.
From the arrival of the grant of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob artist Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received much acclaim under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time jumps from youth to near retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob returned to his childhood home in his free yard.
And then the play began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his parade role as the great son of the city.
Stilecht performed with the two-spanner and "Black Forest F<0xC3><0xBC>chsen" by Erich Becherer from M<0xC3><0xBC>hlenbach.
He was not only welcomed by the audience with much applause, his sister Philippines also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to take on the role of the sister and gave her an incredible life in mimicry and gesture.
Between the individual game scenes, the M<0xC3><0xBC>hlenbacher peasant chapel played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus completed the performance.
In order to honour Haslach’s mayor, Heinz Winkler, the mayor of Haslach, was honoured by H<0xC3><0xA4>ttich, who, together with a part of the city council, made his appearance.
Their anticipation was then made by the three-king singers, who caused Hansjakob to cry out: "How beautiful, there will again be youth memories of my own three-king time alive."
With their song "O Jesulein" they enjoyed the audience in the courtyard as well as the Storchentagkinder with their song "Heraus, Out".
His criticism of the official church at the time had been as strong as his concerns about the growth in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization, or the effects of the war.
In the homestead, behind his tomb chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"An restless spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the play.
There was a lot of applause and a lot of praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: the hopes of the Neckar Giants are growing
The chances of the league remnants of the sporty lower-ranked Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because should there be a wildcard procedure, then there is now one competitor less for the Neckar Giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project does not accept an application for a possible place of origin.
“We will not participate in the Wildcard process,” said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been designing the concept for a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
However, a first breath was not to be missed from Ludwigsburg.
“We didn’t deal with the wildcard procedure, so long as it’s not clear that D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf isn’t getting a license,” said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil.
Until 23 May, ascensioner D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitration court and prove his economic Bundesliga eligibility.
Until now, however, the Rhinelanders have been denied the license twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Evening meal church takes a look
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s cultural and tourism office dedicates the last of its year’s public guided tours on Sunday, October 27, to the Evening Meal Church.
After visiting the Atomkeller-Museum, the Haigerlocher period is to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning end point is a visit to the evening meal church.
There, the leaders are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insight into the development of the evangelical community in a Catholic area through and through.
Last but not least, the church also overlooks the evening meal paintings created by Friedrich Sch<0xC3><0xBC>z with the support of Walter Kr<0xC3><0xB6>ll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original faithful reproduction of the famous Milanese model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the second half-hour guided tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomic Cellar Museum.
Cards are available at the cash register of the Atomic Cellar Museum.
For questions and information, the Tourist Office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. language business in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the Interfax agency, relying on unnamed circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified inter-state, he said.
A Snowden’s departure from Russia is practically ruled out.
"In this case, he is losing his refugee status," the agency quoted its source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatens delivery there, it continued
Long breath is paid
Six men's teams competed in the club's tennis tournament for the winning title.
In the end, the endurance of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of sports friends Rohrdorf for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, with each playing against each.
Played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament went into the crucial phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
In the win, Carmen M<0xC3><0xBC>ller was finally able to hand over the hiking trophy to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was played by Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltricher team reached the bronze staircase.
In the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake, the tournament’s successful outcome took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzw<0xC3><0xA4>lder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in children’s hands.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturdays and Sundays, August 24th and 25th, as part of the summer holiday program to a colorful children’s and family festival with numerous activities and events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release said.
Whether making soap, turning candles, filching or making ropes, the right thing is for every age.
The children will be accompanied by regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
In the museum workshop is also worked.
During the construction of cuckoo pipes, water wheels or circulatory systems, young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship.
A lot of fun also promises the many old games, such as pushcart races or trap races.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the Open-Air Museum offers a guided tour of the museum on Saturdays and Sundays, at 12 and 2 p.m.
On an outcry, the children must guess which stories correspond to the truth or are still lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the Museum of Outdoor Lighting during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found on the site and admired.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, which drives its Schabernack from 11 a.m. with the museum guests.
In the meantime, Hermann B<0xC3><0xBC>ttner is welcoming and fairytale.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11:00, 13 and 15:00.
In addition, the children’s dance group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the besiegers, the sewing machine, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can be seen over the shoulder during their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, visitors to the Museum of Outdoor Lighting are expecting a varied holiday program.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered a lovable caucus because he set out to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt, despite a heart failure, is not to be cut off from his dream.
With his savings, a couple of donations and a mortgage on his old workshop sheds, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the movie there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the hold.
The company has several irons on fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the coal on the camp site in front of the pond.
Two huge blue hold-up and reloaders distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With every movement of the transducer units, a screeching alarm sounds over the ground.
“The signals are for security and are required by law,” says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, with the wind at an unfavourable level, this is widely heard – and so there were already some complaints from people from the city’s north.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close agreement with the authorities, we are now in the process of keeping the warning signs quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he will also engage in open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell has a lot in front of him.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5 metre-deep decking in front of the terminal, Capesize bulk carriers can also be manufactured here for a long time.
“This year, we want to crack the 3 million-ton mark on the envelope,” says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to power plants in the interior.
If then the GDF-Suez power plant goes online, well 5 million tons of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the enormous optimism of the FC Bayern M<0xC3><0xBC>nchen basketball players.
"No one can deny us the belief that we will win against the best team in Europe in the last two years," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at the defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
During their first third appearance in the European king class, the Munichers sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clarified enough in the crucial stages.
The guests initially managed to turn the piece of art, a 15-point stand-back 13 minutes before the end, into a lead before Piraeus gave the game another turn.
"We've fought incredibly hard against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made slight mistakes," Bayern pro Yassin Idbihi said.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the Munich’s most successful pitchers, who had won clear victories in the first two games against Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish titleholder Zielona G<0xC3><0xB3>ra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a speaker at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling the crowd straight jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay’s innovation has been expanded, as was the last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolinas stand-up institution, this year’s festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started at Carolinas and became more and more successful until they were known at some point to perform at a club,” Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
This year’s event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy benefit event for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The world of comedy has also grown with the festival.
A number of comedians taking part in the festival this year have become known for rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known for a sitcom on cable television (the ironic fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racially focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a television show titled “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg” at TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in Larry’s comedy DNA of all his work,” Steinberg said.
He told me when he's here, then sometimes he walks through the streets between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here."
Iran Satisfied with Nuclear Negotiations Process
Iran shows itself one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany satisfied with the negotiation process.
“After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to address the differences of recent years,” Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear fund trader is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game comrade with machete
Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14- and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stunned the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s" reported on Thursday.
After that, they would have played football in front of their apartments in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the young man they had taken with them was supposed to say that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described before the police the procedure without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted to the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
Among other things, the elder called a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily transferred to a psychiatric institution.
The defendant must go to jail
Because of exploitative human trafficking, bribery, threat, insult and dangerous bodily injury, the County Court of Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. George to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorman in Afghanistan after two operations, made a confession as part of a process agreement.
According to him, in five cases he met women over internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the line after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who partly purchased for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he intercepted contacts of women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
It was there that he had them partly monitored to control their income.
In court, the accused initially claimed that he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan were killed alongside him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the psychological limitation and thus about a limited capacity for guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women.
According to a Kripo official, at least four more cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified after a first advertisement by telephone surveillance measures.
The conversations that were heard were characterised by high levels of aggression.
In later trials, the injured would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered blue spots all over her body, has not made a statement to this day.
It is a "totally broken personality" that considers violence and exploitation in this profession to be normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has gotten out of these circles and wants to lead a normal life after the arrest," he said.
Oil price continues to go up to $96 per barrel
The oil price continued to fall on Friday, after concerns over a high supply exceeded a report, according to which China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference raw material for deliveries in December fell by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in the late morning in Europe in electronic commerce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a 5.8 percent price drop in October.
The huge supply of crude oil has strained prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was evidence of stronger demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China’s economy, which grew to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching its lowest level in the previous quarter in two decades.
Brent crude oil, a benchmark for international crude oil, also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel at the ICE Exchange in London.
Court Blocks Decision on NYPD’s Stop-and-Frisk Directive
A federal appeals court in the U.S. on Thursday blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the New York Police Department's Stop-and-Frisk program ("Stop and Search") and dismissed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a decision on the city's appeal was made.
The judge ruled in August that the city violated the constitution in the way the program for detaining and questioning persons is being implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the ordered remedial measures, including the decision to set up a supervisory authority to assist the police in amending its directive and the corresponding training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments for the required suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of the party; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements based on the reasons given in the statement.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they targeted in an inappropriate way black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
She appointed an external authority to monitor the implementation of major changes, including reforms to policies, training and service oversight, and arranged a pilot program with body-worn cameras in neighborhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York declared itself ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released by police after a check.
An oral hearing on the city’s appeal is scheduled to take place after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind have existed for decades in various forms, but the number of recorded controls during the tenure of the impartial mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, a lawsuit was filed by four men belonging to all minorities, who developed into a collectible complaint.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create more trustworthy and effective police, as well as influence the way other police chiefs use the rule.
Opponents are the view that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not criminality; also would waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force that is under pressure after the removal of thousands of posts in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that they did not end the stop-and-frisk practice that is constitutional, but only reform the way the NYPD implemented the controls.
From the happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that manages to reach only dreamy camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the "Helping Hands" association.
On Saturday afternoon, the 10th birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association.
He was first in Mauritania in 2004 at Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on several trips on the site.
During the talks, images of the stakes were shown on a large canvas, so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the aforementioned actions.
The club’s desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to be in advisory function at the club.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a district of misery on the outskirts of the capital - on a voluntary basis, in the record period of almost a week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when in Nagold the birth clinic is to be de-rationalized.
One learns a lot in Africa as a physician, according to Henne, for example, speeding up against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but for this many doctors came to Germany to host here in various areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical devices, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March of this year.
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered plenty of local colour by telling about the Mercedes vehicles converted from Mauritania to the mobile goat stall and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the club, during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal reasons for moving, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young MP.
When it became clear to him how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that the global economy also requires global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair by then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC told the court at Old Bailey, News of the World in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special counsel” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby’s voicemails and stalked them, but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court learned.
“In the opinion of the Attorney General, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is not someone who stands in front of people’s apartment and hopes to tap them on fresh action, but someone who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction,” Edis said.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories in an investigative manner: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it cannot be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies this, but we say, "And if he knew."
Rumors about an affair Clarkes was first picked up by NotW's feature editorial office when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A tape with voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
At the time the research was under way, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby’s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following message: “I have a story we want to tell tomorrow that I would like to talk to Charles about.”
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important figures, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Blunkett for an affair with a married woman when he himself was linked to co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks fight to have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have added the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned imperial tax, French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting will end without result.
In the conflict over the rich tax, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed arbitration meeting.
On Thursday, President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande received representatives from the <0xC3><0x89>lysée-Palast Association and Federation, and also heard their complaints.
However, he refused to spare football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are expected to pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side was also hard.
The strike, which was announced at the end of November, will also be carried out, said the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The playing days between 29 November and 2 December in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are therefore outstanding.
Walking: No absolute protection possible
“We want to involve the residents in planning early,” Mayor Jens H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler opened the citizen information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to introduce ideas.
H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
The floodwater, which struck on May 15, 2009, unprepared, was a cutting-edge event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, according to H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler.
A river area survey had been commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
“Protecting as many buildings as possible is the goal,” says H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler.
The planning of protection from a German weather service is based on statistical information every 100 years to be expected.
Climate change is accounted for by a 15-percent surcharge.
In technical circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year-old floodwater.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler.
To achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality being able to calculate with state subsidies of around 70 percent.
However, H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler pointed out that there will be funding only if an overall concept is implemented.
To do this, the community relies on the participation of citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval procedure must be carried out.
At best, 2016 can be started with implementation.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) foresees local measures in the inflow of the Irm river from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to bring their concerns to the table.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the site.
Gregor K<0xC3><0xBC>hn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from H<0xC3><0xBC>gelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it requires the interplay of all the presented measures in order to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, the most economical solution was kept to be found, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Disgrace prevailed among the investors of the Altort, who, even in the event of normal weather, have to suffer again and again from an overload of the channel network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, H<0xC3><0xA4>u<0xC3><0x9F>ler pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different from those for flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rain events could be forced.
Dimensioning the waste water channels larger would consume millions.
Heavily injured after collision
In the early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could say little about the accident at first.
However, there are several witness statements that should only be evaluated.
It is stated that the 19-year-old steering wheel of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
The two vehicles collided, with the woman clamping so hard that the fire department took almost half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unclear.
Both of the injured arrived at nearby hospitals.
The route was closed for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostoyevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have some serials.
Amazing the kinship on the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the tall forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoyevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologetic of the Russian soul, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet who is quite valid in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in Heyne Publishing, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories sells two thousand.
Dick explains America - the realm of stunning technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security courage and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had divine experiences, his later books read like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugs had added to his brain.
He understood, early on, that computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator of his creation.
That's the Blade Runner problem.
Killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The “Minority Report” comes from 1956, it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
Here the principle of "pre-crime", "pre-crime", is developed, that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which looks frighteningly similar to ours, mutants look to the future - and the police intervene.
"We are recording individuals who have not violated any law," the head of the agency said.
"We catch them before they can commit a crime of violence."
And: "There are no serious criminals in our society, for this we have a criminal record full of pessimists."
They assume that evil is happening, and prevent the criminal thought from being implemented into action.
Dick’s story acts as the blueprint for the NSA’s anti-terror laws and intercept sound.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works as well.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The chief of police complains that there is no longer a division of violence, the military controls the daily life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is spinning through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Take mistakes and victims not only in buying, but build on them.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Reading Philip K. Dick means always getting closer to the truth.
Speaking about Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. speech about Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the German federal prosecutor’s office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, Interfax reported.
Earlier today, Green Party member Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele had met Snowden as the first German politician in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA disclosures strengthen corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a mild day in late August, a German police helicopter flew deep through the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany’s financial capital.
At the request of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Home Office, he should photograph the roof of the US outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a word exchange between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the U.S. did not use any foreign spying capabilities to “steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit.”
But since Edward Snowden, a former Whistleblower employee, began publishing his fillhorn to U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate executives are no longer sure they can speak to the director.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency is spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has obtained data from U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company’s paranoia to a new high level due to state surveillance.
The rush to overrun brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been wired, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then surely corporate leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data is used for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” explains Oliver Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n, president of BITMi, representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the U.S. now posed an almost equal risk to China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY.
However, there was no evidence so far in Snowden’s documents that the U.S. had passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have voiced their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are sceptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn’t have let it go 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Yet the reach and technical refinements of the US spy agencies uncovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest spy risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to local jurisdiction and is therefore potentially compromised.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after disclosures about U.S. data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-U.S.-based members plan to use an American provider.
Jim Snape, SAP’s deputy managing director, says: “We see a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago – it’s: Where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that it will stay physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German corporate leaders represent the view that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore must be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
That's always been the case.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed due to the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
Americans spy on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The management of the company usually does not boast about the countermeasures that have been taken, because this provides advantages to the attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been blinded to the fact that taking a free USB stick at a trade fair or leaving a laptop unattended in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a member of the board of directors at car manufacturer Audi, says it has been standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid handsets when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid handsets are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world market leaders in their niche.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” the BVT warns in a report.
The U.S. warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, France, Russia and Israel were ranked in the US National Intelligence Estimate in February behind China as two of the countries that used to obtain economic data from the hacking.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Homeland Security Service (DCRL), was quoted this month in an interview saying: “The secret services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Hechingen: Fair answers wedding questions
“Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that man can undertake,” said the philosopher S<0xC3><0xB6>ren Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding ceremony was successful, now gave a special exhibition in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has kept coming back.
It starts with wedding dresses, for example.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front are the clothes often decorated and fitted with embroidery closed, often with a veil, but at the back they go down the back and often end up in a drawer.
However, the ghosts differ, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Kleiderm<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
For men, the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but it can also be chosen cream or brown combinations.
It is important to choose the location, it has been explained.
Jewellery-free side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the remise.
If you want to proceed with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for it.
“Cutes are also popular for boys’ sledding,” he says.
Romance is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion comes the "after-wedding photo" - i.e. series of recordings in special places, preferably for example waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Do not forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successfully
For the time being, the athletes of the dog-friendly Bitz were successful in a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it to 12 with 87 points.
Susi H<0xC3><0xB6>pp, with her Woody in the 1st grade, took a critical look at the performance judge.
Parents of a Georgia teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The teenager’s parents, whose body was found in a rolled-up ring mat in his high school gymnasium, are convinced their son was murdered, the family’s lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in an upright mat that stood behind the stands in the school gymnasium.
Lowndes County sheriff's investigation officials came to the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family doubted.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed that he died the way the sheriff had concluded.
“They are of the opinion that it is every logic that violates the laws of physics as well as common sense,” said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to school to study and came back in his body bag,” he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday there will be a formal investigation into Johnson’s death as a number of important issues remain unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was stated by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a “position-related stuttering.”
A second autopsy, however, resulted in another cause of death, Moore said.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he will order the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff’s Office was not immediately prepared to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ruled on Wednesday that authorities must release all surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the video recordings contained clues as to how he died.
CDC Releases Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children with food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines contain information for schools that are designed to raise awareness of food allergies in the teaching staff and staff, and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrine in stock – the EpiPen brand auto-injection is most commonly used – in order to be able to cope with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the states have recently changed the regulations so that schools can more easily keep Epinephrine in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that are called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it,” or “My tongue is crawling.”
Parents of intersex children can choose “sex indefinite”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognized for children born with unambiguous genitalia.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents are no longer required to declare sex for such children, but can indicate “indefinitely” or “not specified” on the birth certificate.
The goal of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make informed decisions regarding operations for gender assignment in newborns, and to combat the discrimination of intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, according to the BBC, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children are born neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to the intersex, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (egg sticks or testicles), or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. recommend using the best available information for gender assignment if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child, before an operation at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law “sounds like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgical intervention, but for most children this is not the case,” he said.
You can perform a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her sexual identity at all is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It’s like the secret to why people are gay.
In a 2011 report to the European Commission, intersex people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically defined as both at the same time or as one.
These properties were shown in inferior sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersex and transgender people face in their professional lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and pre-trial crime.
Boys who do not agree with the gender picture now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to indicate male, female or “third gender” on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby, 52, was recognized as the world’s first “genderless” person after a court granted lifetime retention of an “undetermined” gender status.
In addition to M and W, German IDs will have a third assignment, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the “gender theory” should be removed from textbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online also spoke out against German law, stating: “If the world is torn into a new state where sex is a decision, but sexual activity is not, then we twist two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
“Parenting is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the gender of your own child,” she told the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were referred to as hermaphroditic, after the attractive Greek God, who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine regarded sex as something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are questioned after it is now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also lie because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned to them.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called a ‘psychiatric emergency,’” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unambiguous genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that sex is formable.
He coined the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental harassment – as parents raise a child – interacted with a child’s genes and hormones, thus shaping whether a person viewed himself as male or female.
However, in a case known as “John/Joan” in 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated during a slurred cut, to castrate the child completely and also to remove his hips and then to raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male gender and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations entered the public, who are "unhappy with the result".
For example, with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but with ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never lead a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organ and the testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD, through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After he learned the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections and allowed his breasts to be removed.
Through the operation, he became infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called the Interface Project for intersex people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based advocacy group Advocates for Informed Choice, is worried that German law could “encourage stamping and stigmatizing.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a ‘undetermined’ to the child,” she said.
We are afraid this will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female gender and then wait.
But we do not yet know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to be recognized as a third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,” she said.
German law refers to the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at this time.
If you are an adult, you can decide for yourself about your body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburg-based breast radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says German law is “authorized” by both parents and children.
Katie, Baratz's daughter, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Due to the receptor defect of target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an assistant in child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
“The law gives parents space, so they don’t have to make decisions in a hurry,” Baratz said.
It gives them the time to do different tests and clear things up and gives them time to write “male” or “female.”
In this way, everything is fine – you pull the child big and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the happiness of parents.
And you don’t have to perform an operation that can no longer be reversed.
“This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that surrounds parents because they think they wouldn’t do the right thing,” she explained.
In the end, the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that’s wonderful.
As a result, children are able to make the decision themselves.
Unknown Injured Girl By Shot From Car
Unknown persons have injured a 12-year-old man in Saxony-Anhalt in a car shooting.
The perpetrators allegedly fired at a group of children with an air force on Thursday evening in Genthin.
This was shared by the police in the castle.
The girl was slightly injured on the left wade.
Rescuers brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that was passing by a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The attackers also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
Criminal police said it was found on Friday.
Until now, the police inspectorate can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were only called twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the owners recognized this in time and removed the egg residue immediately, no damage should have been done.
In addition, some sylvester bulbs were also set on fire in the city area, but no damage was done here either.
A resident in the Bishop's-Frienddorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in cloth paper and his wheelbarrows were removed.
By the time the police arrived, however, the man had found his wheelbarrows in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to continue to work.
Living with a Future Perspective
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives dreamy.
Her house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
In the city it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"Hopefully you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new home for my husband and myself for some time now.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the worry of being unable to cope with the many steps to the house and in the apartment in old age, she explains.
In addition: Since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifties woman has had to learn on her own body what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability.
Recently, a book of hers has appeared on the topic of 'Happiness Living in Age - Which form of living is best for me?'.
“Our apartment is the best example of what’s not going to happen in old age,” she begins to say.
When she moved into the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with the middle of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who deal with the topic of 'living in old age' at all.
Most people push it away as long as it goes.
“It’s always just the others,” she said smiling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you think about it.
“It might be too late,” Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 residential models for self-determined living in old age.
“What kind of housing you choose is always an individual decision,” she explains.
D i e solution does not exist for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement seat in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he can also become ill.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language, one can also unite in the Dolce Vita,' says the author of the textbook to think about settlement volunteers.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of living or the often cited pensioner WG.
In old age, everyone has their ticks and make-up
“For me, such a community would be nothing,” she says with an eyebrow.
Not at all like in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
“In old age, you just need his retreat rooms,” Ries says.
However, the author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior housing community can still work.
However, this must be done differently than in the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want his peace, she believes.
With this view, it is at least not alone in the capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible', is also the experience of Theresa R<0xC3><0xBC>tten, the head of the civil service Life in the age of the capital.
Your agency advises people on the topic of 'getting older'.
That’s why even older people would often take in inconveniences and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their usual environment, that’s also the experience of the Foundation Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends that all those who deal with the age-appropriate remodeling of their house or apartment should first be informed in detail and not hire the first-rate craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clears up.
But it is not always possible to redesign the existing apartment with age and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be made by Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, which is also paved with stairs to the door of the apartment but that would be a much bigger obstacle.
She will continue searching until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she was crying more than in front of the spider at her apartment door.
U.S. wants to continue prosecution of Snowden
The U.S. has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence official Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of illegally passing on classified information.
That’s why he has to face criminal proceedings in the United States, said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Even Snowden’s recent statements would not change that.
Earlier, German green politician Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele had appealed to the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele’s statements were about a member of parliament and not a member of the German government.
Edward Snowden, the intelligence officer, is in principle ready for a conversation with German authorities.
At first, however, he wants to know his situation clearly.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the US in an unaddressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the federal government, Bundestag and attorney general.
After a translation by Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele, the letter has the following wording:
To the responsible
I was asked to write to you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was previously employed as a contract officer or as a direct technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the laws of my government, which caused me to act out of a moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I was exposed to a serious and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and even high officials - including the United States - have judged the disclosures to be a system of comprehensive surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These spying revelations drew many proposals for new laws and guidelines that aimed at the formerly covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks involved have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government still treats Dissens as a breach of trust and seeks to criminalize political expression and bring charges.
Yet, to speak the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will take this admissible stance.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are brought to light, I will be able to comply with the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, in accordance with the law.
I look forward to having a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden, by Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
“The building is in good hands,” says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier.
The former Kindergarten in the Gartenstra<0xC3><0x9F>e has been sold by the municipality to a private person.
The sale was approved by the City Council at its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "appropriate" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier emphasizes.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000 was invested in the budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former Kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before winter and thus no longer has to come up for the entertainment of the house, how to heat, look after the garden and clear the pavement.
“This effort is now gone,” Maier says.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a concert space on the terrace of the Hammer inn.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clock at 7.30 pm, the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The president Manuela Honeck explains the music pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first musician’s stroke.
Report: Obama campaign considering replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign by Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times is ahead of a copy of the upcoming book, and it reported on Thursday evening that the president’s top advisers had conducted “extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011” to find out if Obama’s swirling hope of re-election looks better when he drops bids.
According to Jonathan Martin, a national political correspondent for the Times, the book thoroughly chronicles the efforts of leading campaign and White House officials, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the polls, the former Secretary of State Clinton versus the Vice President.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, Obama’s former campaign manager, Jim Messina, and the White House’s former senior advisers, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – were aware of the planned change.
In "Double Down", Daley is alleged to have been at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite their "close, personal relationship" before finally deciding against such a move after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy would "not outweigh Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said a lot of things to consider, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
One has to remember that the president at the time had appalling polls, so we thought, “For God’s sake, what do we do?”
While Daley referred to the investigations as "providing care", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been made during the campaign for re-election to determine whether such a move would pay off with regard to the election rounds.
“In campaigns, you don’t spend that much money on surveys and focus groups if you don’t think seriously about something,” Martin told AC360.
It is not clear, however, if Obama knew his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN he had asked Daley if his then boss had been aware of the potential change.
While Daley said he did not believe the president was "conscious" about the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that “Double Down” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes would have reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn’t know anything about the investigations into whether to drop Biden in the election.
“Possible,” Martin replied.
What happens on the go with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Did the design of the Internet service e-mail have the same technical implementation as the traditional mail?
In the conception of early Internet services, the priority was to make communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been taken care to create a stable basis for a secure exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional email corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
Anna’s email program or browser sends the email to the mail server of her service provider in the first step.
For example, if you have a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content at his provider.
Are traditional e-mails read on their way through the web?
Most emails are read multiple times by software robots on the go.
The sender’s provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also performed on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is a troublesome and unwanted spam email that is deleted immediately or at least sorted out into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails?
The likelihood of unauthorized people reading an email is extremely low.
Theoretically, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
The law enforcement agencies and intelligence services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take notice of emails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from co-reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against co-reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to mask the metadata of an email communication, so that it is not even possible to identify without further notice who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the email market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google, according to an August 2013 survey by Convios Consulting, play only a minor role in the mostly privately used mailboxes.
While Yahoo mail’s shares had fallen recently, Google’s GMail was able to significantly increase.
Mother in the forest tightened and pensions cashed
When his foster mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to cash their pensions and care.
In order to continue cashing in pensions and care, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police investigations in the forest.
At first, he hid the death of the 89-year-old, then he dragged the money in for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected as early as May: At the time, it was revealed that the mother in need of care no longer needed medication.
The investigator told the pensioner that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because the officials found this strange, they went on to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an autopsy did not provide any indication of a capital crime.
Do you like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first dark-lit ice – with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescing properties of the marine animals and created a luminous treat from them.
The idea came to him after he had read a research paper on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, raising the pH in the protein and triggering the luminaire.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and glows – the more you leak, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious,” says: “The product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth heats up the protein, the pH increases and the ice lights up.
We’ve tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the chandelier is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes good for that.
Charlie's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is going to be even more ambitious.
He says, “I’d like to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is on and for itself impossible because of the breakage caused by the ice crystals, which are made up of ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jelly that is artificially made by Chinese scientists
After six game days, the TSV Morsum is still without any points in the Handball-Verbandsliga.
Calculated now, the team of Ingo Ehlers will come to the Derby tomorrow against TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season begins again for us.
“I hope we finally have our heads free,” Ehlers says optimistically.
At last, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has his complete cadre at his disposal.
Daverden is just as fast as we are.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
In the first place, however, it is necessary to increase in coverage, which has ultimately left everything other than a safe impression.
Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz is more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that’s why we’re not the favourite for a long time, because everything can always happen in the Derby.
However, Panitz now wants to settle down in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
For this purpose, the A-Juvenile Joost Wind<0xC3><0x9F>u<0xC3><0x9F>, who is active with double play rights at the A-Jugend Bundesligalist HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress for the neighborhood.
Today, I became a Halloween muffler.
In the last two years I have not declared myself willing to distribute from my apartment out of sweets, and will probably not do so this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the American Retailers Association (NRF).
One thing that I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year is the year of the last cry of the most exciting unlived objects.
Women no longer have to dress in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk world-dreamers will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I don’t think there is anything wrong with tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs and were not alone in my surprise.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, according to the NRF.
These are a lot of hot dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we're not squishy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That’s about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, tortoises, candy and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, who use the phrase “sweet or sour” to pull through the neighborhood.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s not pretend – eat.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is the sugary Candy Corn; however, 15 million kilograms of it are sold for Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweets Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't solved yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than the houses where it pops up.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which by the way is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that make $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos that you’re just pinning yourself in your pants and putting your friends on Facebook, where you don’t get rid of them, and then you’re going to look at the guy, and then you’re going to talk to the guy.
But we finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lattice is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we’ve made up from a young age.
Fortunately, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up with cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lattice, which is slowly rotting in the front garden, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut some pumpkins out of their 921 kilos of pumpkin.
Housing fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces burn bodies
The fire department had to fire in Helmbrechts late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in Hof district catches fire in the night to Friday.
The rescuers mount a chilled corpse from the house.
Rescuers found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it was a resident is still unclear, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening it had burned to the ground floor of the house.
When the fire department arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The officers went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All the other residents had not been home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building was no longer habitable at first.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany’s largest state church has launched an offensive campaign to promote the pastor’s profession.
Background is a possible lack of parishioners: The Evangelical Lutheran Landeskirche Hannover expects that the number of its current 1,800 pastors will halve according to the current situation by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in an interview with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine itself.
With Burfien, for the first time, the Landeskirche commissioned a pastor in a full position to inspire young people to study theology.
Currently, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation.
Burfien refers to the process of de-churching: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can put my focus where it matters to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as a caregiver.
They earned as much as teachers and could live on it well.
Of course, in the free economy more will be paid, but theologians would have a safe employer.
This is the case with the young people of today, who are not only concerned with careers, but with a mind-blowing job.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, currently some 60 pastors retire every year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study start their vicariate.
In thinly populated marginal areas such as the Harz, Emsland or Wendland, it may become difficult to occupy positions in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The theological study offers a wide range of training.
You can even become a federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
Inside there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a free-of-charge system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with the support of bowler-work mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally customers who come to bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as a path to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format will open up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the traps and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – it will be a fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge has a training and testing day in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters called to rescue a dog who stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock outcrop in a quarry
Cockerspaniel dog Ruby ran away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in a stone quarry in her miserable location.
Firefighters set sail on a rock wall and rescued the dog from safe death
The fire department managed to bring a puppy to safety, which stuck on a 15-meter-high protrusion in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old cockerspaniel dog Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived on her own three days before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, to whom the dog belongs, came to the stone quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to welcome Ruby again and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing dog and posted help calls on social networks when she ran into the quarry after the small traffic accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the beached Ruby on the 15 metre high heel in the quarry.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station’s technical rescue team rushed to the scene and set off to rescue Rubys, who was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a specialist on the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn’t move a muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a few dog cakes.
This was a rather unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had a huge luck.”
There was a possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet, but found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching the rescue was scary.”
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was great to keep them in their arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and she had collapsed, she would probably have collapsed.
The firefighters did a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed upstairs.”
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never saw Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry explained that she had eaten with the Altrocker in the evening and that "he backed me up when I was 18".
She added: “It’s been a long time and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denies that he ever attempted rapprochement with Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Perhaps she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album “Prism” landed at No. 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European Detachment Gives Scots the Choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a fence secured with a barbed wire along the Hadrianswall.
In fact, the Strathclyde model pointed out the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel to the rest of Europe, but this did not – as expected – play a role in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often bend their strict rules when it is more favourable to them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continuing non-compliance for Brussels would be just a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
Actually, not a story.
And one that has come in such a way over the years that it is already like a fossil: for the first time I heard the “independence means passport control” ente at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why does the London Joc trade against that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has come to an end.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
All over the EU, parties who are hostile to the EU gain ground or want to throw the euro on board as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative Party for Germany – founded only this year – managed to win almost five million votes in the September federal election, effectively driving the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Due to the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket in which the respective national economy is needed by holding on to the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pinned its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to do so.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity downturn compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin.
Behind the current state and currency problems lies a deepening European productivity problem.
As a result of the “green” energy directives mandated by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and quadruple for gas compared to the United States.
This is a palpable cost downside, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world’s payroll records do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is taking place, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France’s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and raise Paris to the eye with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimation and Europe has pushed its own economic policy, which has the French economy to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, EU-hostile Front National has just won a decisive re-election, leading the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white working class French?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut off well in these elections – and this is very well possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to go beyond: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the “Europe of the (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold onto the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project in the hope of getting involved with the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all of this?
We can decide to be a region of (last resort) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which also includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can get where.
I suspect that Scotland could do very well in a looser European union if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar thinking countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and committed) cuts made by Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to choose independence now, only to be forced to have a austerity policy from Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Growing Faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty more than their white peers, as studies show.
Physical changes don’t mean puberty right away.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts Believe Epidemic Obesity Is a Cause of Early Puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter already grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Children’s Physicians Association this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming down parents – usually that’s not a sign that puberty is coming fast,” Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and ash hair, as well as body odor, show up in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (the appearance of the first rule bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When the development of breasts begins, it still takes at least two to three years to menarche,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of the book “Early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem.”
Time is the most accurate test as puberty progresses.
It’s controversial what actually represents the beginning of puberty, but it’s “early” when breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something a pediatrician can closely monitor.
With faster progress, tests could be displayed by an endiclonologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: the premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant when it comes to drugs, but he admits: “Repressing puberty can alleviate behavior problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how to handle the hygienic side,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter got her 10 days.
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are causal.
Boys come into puberty similar to girls in the past.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine, which establishes a link between body fat and puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty more than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys’ facial and pubic hair is already growing earlier, the trend towards a full-fledged early puberty is not as pronounced as it is for girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underscore the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and sham hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the true beginning of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This can mean that you have to have a conversation sooner than expected,” Kaplowitz advised.
When you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers fight over seat width in the face of large orders
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a debate over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, indicating the tone for a bitter crash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long tourist-class flights – not always the ones that airlines strive for the most, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that requires a seating width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but U.S. Army rival Boeing says that should be decided by airlines.
The debate comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and record orders are expected at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic results that the new “mini-jumbo” design is to deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernized 777X seats 406 people in the tourist class, which are over 17 inches wide, allowing for ten per row.
Airbus says the competing version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often distribute hives via technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press.
Airbus is now appealing to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to race.
Recently, the company introduced an ad that could be the start of a new ad war, and showed donors an image in which three people sat in a restaurant chained together, and the title: “Would you accept that?”
“Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turboprops,” said Airbus Sales Director John Leahy.
In the face of changing eating habits, people get fatter, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American increased by 10 percent between the ages of 40 and 49, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival stuck to a 1950s seating concept when the average body circumference of the newly christened “Jet Set” was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have shown that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing is contesting Airbus’ figures on seat sizes and says it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance airfares and facilities.
The company also explains that, according to research, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seating width.
“It’s really going to be about giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to do to be successful,” explains cabin expert Kent Craver from Boeing.
They don’t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is about more e-book freedom, but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly a topic that can affect sales.
Behind the discussion is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion after list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seating layout is the driving force behind the discussion about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements on the results depend in part on the 777X being compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777 with its ten seats per row.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than in the currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“Boeing therefore squeezes more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products,” says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at European Airbus.
Analysts, on the other hand, say full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement, which could be associated with cheaper fares.
“Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is driven by the threat from the 777,” says Mary Kirby, expert on cabin design, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world’s leading jet sellers even carry a tape measure to measure the facilities in the competition.
Even if they appreciate the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-condensed design for cheap airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not yet sold, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized how important more adaptability of the cabins is and offered wide seats on the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the reputation is likely to be bloated to a new industry standard, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotinic vaccine could make the garage for the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before human testing, further trials are needed, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and tried all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
Antibodies hunt down the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, thereby preventing a smoker from experiencing nicotine-high.
In trials, vaccinated mice who were given nicotine retained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a "delay", the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine has reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier tabaki vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it converts liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans could, if he is quite sure, be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, is that smokers would use it to stop.
“They then know that when they start smoking again, they don’t feel pleasure anymore because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them put off the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labor Party minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being investigated by the state corruption watchdog.
The former NSW minister disputes having changed the regulations on maritime reclamation at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned hidden stakes in three plots of land on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) on Friday extended its investigations into whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state in this regard, pacts at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without a tender after their August 2005 expiration.
Now it is determined that Tripodi knew of Obeid's hidden interest in the estates, after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole had said accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks, which began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the pacts.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer runs.
In 2009, the contracts for the companies at Circular Quay, which brought in $2.5 million annually to the Obeids, were extended without public tendering.
Tripodi, who served as port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken out for public tenders.
But he refuses to have made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reshaping of the government's pact regulations.
One of the telephone records submitted to the ICAC showed conversations in August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
“Was the topic discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial lease arrangements?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” Tripod replied.
I can’t remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn’t.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter jets attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday, a senior government official told Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to ‘reality test’
The government is considering a “reality test” for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of extended measures.
If the test is to be introduced, it will be used via a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used as a backdoor for attracting family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was released after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s comments on foreign workers because they could be seen as insulting by Australia’s neighbors.
“Strong statements such as ‘Australians should stand back’ and ‘Australians first’ are a very unpleasant setback in times when unions were demanding a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region imitate an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The proposal outlines twelve measures that were once considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who spoke yesterday about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the “marriage criterion” is taken over, then a person applying for a visa could be examined as to whether “the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking or is connected in person.”
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after in the past companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island this week on a refugee boat.
The man’s troubled nine-year-old son, who had come with him to Australia, has been cared for since his father’s death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
A study has been announced by the British government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to realize high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England as early as the start of phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacities and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of finally three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings huge benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown urged Carmichael to “incomprehensiblely” engage in Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail connection holds the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time, the economic power of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK.”
That is why we are delighted to work as a partner of the British Government and to explore the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland, which creates benefits for everyone and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force for the time being in Australia
Australian air passengers must also continue to turn off tablets and smartphones on take-off and landing, despite efforts in the U.S. to loosen regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their specifications so that passengers on their devices can read, watch or play e-books during critical flight phases, as long as they are in “flight mode.”
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they take off and landing.
Australian companies are monitoring the decision on the implementation of which U.S. airlines are required to do a large amount of work, but do not follow any immediate plans to amend their regulations.
The aviation safety authority CASA also stated that the announcement will be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
“CASA does not currently have any specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft,” it said.
The subject is subject to provisions according to which airlines maintain safety at all times and passengers must comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA on extending the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and declares that one is open to changes, but these should be initiated by the legislator.
“We would welcome a review of CASA’s approval of electronic devices because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesman said.
Qantas stated that it will remain in the current regulations until further notice.
“Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices are not allowed to be used when launching and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that,” the company said in a statement.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision is different for U.S. companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They need to prove that their planes can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and customer instruction.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book reading devices and smartphones at any level,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the equipment during the landing.
The group also recommended to safely store heavier devices under the seat or in the compartments over the seats when starting and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, fellow BVB supporters had provided light rockets for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund subsequently announced severe consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost spooky acoustic that offered itself to the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German vice-master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were listening to their songs.
The South Tribune, on the other hand, where the most loyal – and loudest – BVB fans stand, initially presented itself exceptionally quietly: no singing, no fighting calls.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint celebration, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the stands, a large flag with the inscription "Section of the stadium ban" alone blew.
Only as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always, as the first BVB player entered the place, was short-lived joy.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and crying noises – but not everywhere for a long time.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune, nothing was stirred.
Even the fact that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again counted the positive experiences of the last few days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Klopp - did not provide a festive mood.
Just five minutes before the touch, the Capo climbed his Podest - and the tension that could be grasped by the hands until then escaped in a loud cry, when Dickel, as usual, questioned the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
Last, as always, the South Tribune was on the line - and finally it was here again as usual the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call for "Derby winner stands up" came with a whistle from the South Tribune, everything was again as usual.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Just before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB trailers that had travelled had fired light rockets into the spectator ranks and into the square - and almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller met.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fans.
“There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement,” the BVB boss announced at a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras from choreographing for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I have forbidden it," he said.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy in terms of pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras were shown different possibilities of punishment - by Tuesday they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
“It’s going to be tough,” Watzke said.
One may be anxious as to how the reactions on the South Tribune will then fall out.
Pfandh<0xC3><0xA4>user booms in Singapore as the crisis in the middle class has arrived
Janani Amirthalinga swaps a golden armband, a ring and a pair of earrings at a penthouse in the shopping center of Bendemeer in Singapore to pay for her daughters’ school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house, and all my money is in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 a month (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,730) as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not rich, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it made its exchange, became the third fund house to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Bonding jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Pfandh<0xC3><0xA4>user in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just over the 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
Pfandh<0xC3><0xA4>user, however, offer the advantage that there is no need to check the creditworthiness or proof of income, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to orphanages, as families feel pressured by rising living costs as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose financial policy in the developed economies, families with lower and middle incomes are looking for hostels to compensate for the difference in a struggling economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s described growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the agency, have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a drop in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that, given the rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” said Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks at gold prices over the past two years have further strengthened the trend towards the binding of personal items, as people take advantage of the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are in the city’s 200 inns of gold.
People say to themselves, “The gold price looks good, let’s plant Grandma’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
EasyMoney, Thailand’s largest fund-raising operator, has seen a 20 percent increase in customers in its branches over the past few months.
The growth in the fund business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yea Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company is funding this with 60 percent of the $66 million Singapore dollar it took with the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some lenders got into the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that mortgage lenders not only offered cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly raise the debt.
“Customers are borrowing items they already own, and liquefied personal items don’t increase household education,” she explains.
The mortgage business is increasingly accepted by society as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use mortgages are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax’s stores to tie gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from all walks of life come to us.
“This includes wealthy people who borrow something for a business or an investment in the short term, or small businesses who have to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow,” says Yeah.
Sometimes you just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data off Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Secret Service discoverer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to clear up the ever-expanding NSA language business.
According to the presentation of the Green Party deputy Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele, at his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia, it was about what conditions the former intelligence officers would say at a German public prosecutor’s office or before an investigation committee.
Snowden has referred to his complicated legal situation, Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele told ARD magazine Panorama.
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the bailout of over 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health care system to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to address a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has outlined an emergency rescue package that, in our view, addresses the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in immediate aid for election performance.
By further 2600 operations, including orthopedic interventions and treatments due to gray star, residues are to be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better follow-up care after stationary stays, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that clinicians who have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,” Plibersek said.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accounting obligation of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A tripartite commission is set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would only be of little use if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that will bring the public health system of Tasmania to a more sustainable course.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state’s public health system from the list of concerns,” Wilkie said.
According to the federal government, these election benefits will largely bet on the recent cuts.
But the health-policy spokesman of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, is of the opinion that today’s announcement is only a “plastic solution”.
“That’s why we’re in a position today because the Labor government has taken $430 million out of the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
It can’t be that a state government rips almost half a billion dollars out of the system and puts 300 million into the Commonwealth and then does it as if the good news is good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also more difficult to cost than necessary.
The French action of the 1760s tells the gripping story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of another's erotic fascination.
The film never slides into lust or sensational desire – and that’s where its problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it also for the audience the Quélerian boot shirt.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, says a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed major chemical weapons and poison gas munitions facilities, the global monitoring group for chemical weapons said on Thursday, while in the north of the country there were severe clashes near one of the locations where allegedly toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date
On 1 November, the Damascus-based organization set up in The Hague to destroy all chemical weapons production facilities or make them "inoperable", including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
According to estimates, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, experts say there is a production facility for chemical weapons as well as warehouses, as reported by the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 desert army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the death toll in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom have links to al-Qaida groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fighting underscores the danger posed by chemical weapons inspectors because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal of weapons is a race against time amid a looming civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is “now convinced that it has seen and experienced the destruction of all major production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria.”
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of the 23 sites indicated by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, it was not possible to visit two facilities, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC declared that the two sites had been “disclosed ... and the objects of the chemical weapons program there had been moved to other so-called facilities that were inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“I take the courage and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization,” Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director General of the OPCW, said in a statement.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war against the Assad government and its security forces, which are many members of the Alawites, have been fighting a split from Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over judgment for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict of the last of the founders who was brought before the court, as Umar Patek was supposed to be shot in the affirmative.
Patek, who has been on the run for nearly ten years as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted people, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, where 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and many others injured.
A charge was also made in a number of terrorism-related charges, which included a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor’s office had demanded a life-long prison sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation as a master bomber, is also referred to as a “demolition man” who could have applied for the death penalty.
The decision has evoked painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in the devastation that Patek and his co-conspirators committed nearly ten years ago.
Struggling with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“You should put him in front of a firing squad,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day that I won’t get another grandson and I’ll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was leveled to the ground when a huge bomb exploded in a small cargo truck just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002, parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had a backpack filled with explosives exploded.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and “died” three times while hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty above all the others.
To leave him alive – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last Bali bomber to face trial.
He escaped nearly a decade of detention, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden almost four months later.
During the negotiation, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
“He didn’t stop,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict came ahead of the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is being carried out with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in airplanes (but do not conduct cell phone conversations)
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices from departure to landing to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies, but not phone, according to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of flight personnel as well as the regulations for stowing the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Passengers are currently required to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They are only allowed to restart them once the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometers and gives the captain green light.
Upon entry into the landing, the passengers must turn them off again and must not restart before the aircraft has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are protected from electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even when starting, landing and on the runway, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been refitted for the use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Aviation Association, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it,” Glading said.
We are truly sorry to have to feel like a caretaker on this issue.
Nevertheless, internet connections to surf, exchange e-mails, text messages or download data below three kilometers remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a public jet of American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the flight deck.
And heavier devices such as laptops must also continue to be stowed away, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Cell phone calls during the flight are also still prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices when starting and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the Transportation Safety Authority National Transportation Safety Board, security experts for national traffic issues on CBS News, said mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
“Handy is really a problem, not just because it could potentially cause malfunctions in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmission masts,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee, which was launched by the FAA to investigate this issue, last month recommended that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to loosen restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri are of the opinion that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce, because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, it is said that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore switching off the device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air passengers in 1966, after reports of malfunctions of navigation and communication devices by passenger-guided UKW radios that were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also so designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interference does not matter to them.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the flight altitude is reached.
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation when you flip over.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
One of the advocates of loosening restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to determine problems, but could not detect them.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes the disruption to the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there are only isolated reports of pilots speaking out for a malfunction of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
The FAA recommended, however, that pilots be allowed to order the switching off of the devices by the passengers when the instrument lands under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travelers who today would be equipped with extensive technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Air rescue service of North Sea Bohrinsel rescued bird re-released
An air rescue service on the coast of a bird that had been found exhausted on a North Sea island was released back into the wild.
Last month, the water slide was flown by a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was picked up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA at their rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: “This water slide was probably a winter train bird from northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird was looking for refuge on the island.
He added: “He couldn’t fly any further, which is why we were contacted with the request for help.”
When she was released, the water rattle was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in the UK who care for prosperity and work want to change about our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK economic leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 executives from the business world, representing approximately the UK’s corporate sizes, sectors, and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now export outside of Europe and focus on countries that are modernizing and growing as states stagnate in the EU.
They want new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil to be favored by the government rather than stopping the long and strenuous process of reforming obscure EU institutions.
Asked for their opinion on certain legally regulated topics – from cartel law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competencies should be taken back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market because, according to the companies, the costs of Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trade zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed to the one that is traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and this is probably what our survey of economic leaders shows that a clear majority of the UK wants a course towards a change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This finding, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “meaningful change” that brings the lever of action back to the UK.
It’s about a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a change of opinion at 16% in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the UK economy is behind its plan for renegotiation of UK conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the euro area now moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means for companies an increased focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas station
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, the Gazprom Board said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to provide more diversity on Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which the bulk of Russian gas is stored for Europe, provides an increased risk on conventional routes, as can be heard from official side.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “forever” turned off.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates if the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other countries is expected to begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed to have an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way to get past the real estate location of Germany.
The economic framework data is correct, and the funding options are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the Stock Exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in European comparison.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed to this on the 9th real estate day of the Stock Exchange newspaper.
As German commercial properties are sought, take a look at the transaction volume, according to Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year’s period.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France it was 19%.
“Immobilieninvestments offer an attractive interest rate,” Ulbrich said.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault charges against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) have been charged with child-related sexual offences before allegations against childcare worker Jonathan Lord of Caringbah were raised in 2011, as the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse learned.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that “the organization has never had anything to do with an incident of sexual abuse of children”.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about one case in which one YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another in which a YMCA sports teacher at Caringbah Hall had been convicted of child abuse in 1991.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the Commission’s assistant lawyers that he knew about the first case, but did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA has been recognised as at the forefront of child safety”.
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second-lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started at 21 at the YMCA, admitted that the management had “failed from me down” at Lord’s appointment and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety guidelines.
At the beginning of the year, Lord was convicted of sexual misconduct against twelve boys during his two-year tenure with the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare argues, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations regarding children’s safety.
The staff said they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, cared for them privately as a babysitter, let them sit on his lap, told one that he loved it, and let children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had asked for a training for child protection because she was worried about his behavior, said that the child services manager Jacqui Barnat, who was Lords' supervisor at YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very near".
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements from employees, which they would not have trusted to reimburse their superiors.
Rather, he said, their friendship with the Lord had impaired their judgment, which is why they had not reported him.
Hare stated that he informed the YMCA NSW Board of Directors that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the “Jonathan-Lord incident” was “not about reporting” by employees, and the Board agreed to it.
Hare said the decision to push employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the charges were filed had been made by YMCA’s child services chief Liam Whitley.
He said that contamination of the evidence should be prevented, but that was “overt” and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual abuse of children, the Commission.
He explained that there were “serious problems” in hiring, checking, hiring, training and supervising employees.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would use the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but admitted that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic political issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments have mostly been limited to foreign policy and his role as envoy to the Peacekeepers’ Quartet in the Middle East.
When asked if he would like to return to the prime minister’s office, Blair was quoted as saying by the Evening Standard from London: “Yes, sure, but it’s unlikely that this will happen, so...”
When the horse show experts set out in Scharen in Cardiff to pick the horse of the year, they were aware that there was a fierce competition.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who isn’t even in kindergarten yet and only made his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee broke loose through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable pair, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behavior, and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate cap in a rough angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which is far above his age.
And Toffee received best scores for his performance and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift on his third birthday and has been practicing with the Shetland Pony ever since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and toffee are a great strain.”
They had to compete against the entire participant field and went from place to place with gold trophy and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been teaching horses for over ten years.
Howells said, “The whole audience was like electrified and everyone fired at him and slammed him.”
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares about.
Just as he started, it won’t take long until he’s on the “horse of the year” show – and I’m sure he’ll cut well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The jurors assessed Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten themselves and presented themselves in the lecture ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and the leader – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton’s cute clothes have contributed their part to making it really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be ‘reformed’ after call
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter who had been accused of defamation, was to be reformed on the front page, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fake reports about a sub-state company.
Now the New Express will be subject to a "comprehensive rectification", the regulator said.
The “rectification order” was made by the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the Neue Express was disordered,” the regulator said in a statement.
She said she had decided to "punish an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and to deprive him of his reporter's license."
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to carry out a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant officials at the New Express and to immediately review the management team of the New Express.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence,” he told state-run news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out of money and fame.
It became clear to me that I did the wrong thing.
Following Chen’s apology, the New Express issued an apology on the front page and stated that it failed to properly review the reports.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions will still be routinely enforced, despite a law change earlier in the year in which the authorities were banned from forcing someone to blame themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railroad between the US and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-by-90-centimeter tunnel as one of the most elaborate passages they would have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless inconspicuous warehouses, which makes it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized in it, authorities said.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to court records.
Three men, who were reportedly working as drivers, were charged with possession and intentional sale of marijuana and cocaine, according to the authorities.
They are threatened with imprisonment for a term of ten years and for life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico in October after the marijuana harvest, which poses the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-meter-long passageway with rails running from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actors Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken out about the separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, “Life sometimes doesn’t go exactly the way we plan or hope.”
Kerr and he still loved each other, the 36-year-old said.
"We will support each other and love each other as Flynn's parents."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
According to Lexika, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but differs from it in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cakes, ice cream, or a strong edamer, these mussels are not on a vegan’s menu.
Milk, cheese, eggs, besides the abandonment of meat and fish, the vegans abandon all consumption of animal products - also honey is denied.
What remains, you may wonder, but with a closer look, the vegan diet is characterized by a considerable wealth of insight.
“Breast spreads are very popular,” explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store in Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealander has been living vegan, in Lampertheim he (almost) finds everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
Around the turn of the century the next step took place and I became vegan.
“The belief came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes,” says Proctor, who prefers leather with leather.
He realized that it also goes into other everyday affairs without animal products.
In the first place, veganism is an ethics.
“I don’t want animals to die for me,” says Proctor, the maxim of vegans that extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, stirrers or rubber bears, the vegans quickly discovered brand-new products, the enthusiasm grew.
“It’s a double bonus,” says Proctor today, “in fact, vegan is not a waiver, not an ashtray, but it’s an enrichment.” The assumption that you reduce the choice of food options by changing your diet is more likely to lead to the power of habit.
And it was precisely these conditionings that made some even so well-intentioned attempts fail.
“The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that allows many to quit quickly, similar to smoking,” Proctor says in a comparison.
And say, "Some tastes are not to be attached to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
“But you can also produce the same effect in other ways,” explains the vegan.
For a barbecue, Proctor brings, for example, eggplants, mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should definitely taste good once in a while.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, which is legitimate.
“It’s supposed to taste good, but that’s not just about reducing animal food,” says Proctor.
Health damage up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the transition had a positive aspect.
I don’t take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who only eat vegan.
“My blood levels are good, I get checked often,” Proctor says.
In particular, many vegans warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
“As animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on the pasture, it’s questionable whether the vitamin B12 portion is high in the meat you buy in the refrigerator,” says Proctor.
For vegans, there is also the possibility of taking the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
“My B12 values are fine,” he explains.
Proctor does not have to go far for food procurement.
After all, there are staples everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I find everything I need on the spot.
Sometimes I just buy something special.
“A lot of people overlook that just the finished products are expensive, but that’s the way it’s known for ‘ordinary’ finished products as well.”
By the way, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly thought.
“In the home kitchen there is a lot to discover, with a few small knives you can achieve good, if not partially better results,” says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake, Proctor was also able to impress his parents-in-law.
Family parties give the vegans a new spice.
This has dynamics, when you cook together, it has a new value.
“The situations that can arise here are as different as the people themselves,” says Proctor.
Of course, he was also faced with skepticism.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - on such questions one has to act as a vegan with a fingertip feeling.
"I do not reject people, I am part of this society," Proctor does not want to delay an enclave.
And more precisely, the everyday world doesn’t seem as vegan as it seems – and the vegan is not as restricted in everyday life as it is commonly thought.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
“Many doner shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka,” says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he escapes to pasta dishes, or just order a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow on this.
“When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult,” the New Zealander says, “You have to talk to people, pay attention to them.”
“If there are enough demand, they may be inclined to supplement the menu,” he hopes.
Vegan restaurants develop, such as the Mannheim van or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are the exact opposite of exclusive.
“Meal dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,” Proctor notes.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make the vast majority of the world impossible,” Proctor says.
However, buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at first.
In particular, if one learns to understand that even in peanuts animal additives can contain as coloring agents, one seems to quickly leave courage with following the ethics with so many hurdles and traps.
Not only that, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to the food and cleaning products.
“After a while, you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to,” Proctor says, “It’s sometimes better to take small steps than to stand or stumble.”
Veganism, it is an important moral fingerprint that strikes the consciousness.
Perhaps he doesn’t quite manage to lay down his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits.
The exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in mind.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a statement, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger panels at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the Nasdaq indices had not been calculated for one hour due to data transport errors.
In August of this year, there had been two pans in a week alone.
At first, the U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively faulty purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
After that, the stock exchange operators took almost a whole day to review and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of all stock trading in the U.S. came to a halt due to a computer failure on the Nasdaq stock exchange for several hours.
Facebook had also taken care of Facebook’s stock market in the past year.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sale orders, later established the SEC’s stock market supervision and fined the company to a record $10 million fine.
Constance: Radler drives 63-year-old
According to police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., was riding a women's bicycle improperly on the left sidewalk from the station towards Marktst<0xC3><0xA4>tte.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped off the sidewalk from a local, the cyclist could no longer brake in time, according to police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and pulled a space wound about 15 centimeters long on the head.
A rescue team brought the injured person to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police give Assange a notice of delivery
British police today handed over a delivery notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old Australian had been given an "invitation to stand up" that would prompt him to appear in a police station, adding that if he did not comply, he would be threatened with arrest.
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual misconduct after his options have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
“Scotland Yard has sent an invitation to a 40-year-old man to stand at a police station at a time we have chosen,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage charges after he posted more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website.
Driver who was hit with 210 km/h and hot drink between the legs gets <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 fine
A driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h and driving a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police arrested him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
Before the Colchester County Court, Howie pleaded guilty without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also convicted of paying costs of <0xC2><0xA3>90 as well as a <0xC2><0xA3>100 victim surcharge.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London's speculative bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision of Treasurer George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a stamp tax of 7% on flats, which cost over <0xC2><0xA3>2 million, as well as annual fees for buyers, tenants as individuals.
Revenues from the stamp duty on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which stood at <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in 2012/13, are already in excess of revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increases in stamp duty on high-priced apartments and the introduction of the associated legislation against circumvention, it can be difficult to claim that high-quality real estate is too low taxed, regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system.”
“But this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant when it comes to buying real estate in London, or selling owners out of it,” he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the prosperous London-based Southwest Belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has sold out at a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging “domestic market” in which the south-western part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the context in which a dog’s squealing is related to its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs with their tail velt more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: “It is well known in humans that the left and right half of the brain respond differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this with other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral swans of their fellow species, the researchers monitor the animals as these films look at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
We’ll probably soon understand why the cock is moving in one direction or the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs films with dogs – either a natural-looking version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog moved the tail to the right (from the perspective of the wandering dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail tends mainly to the left (again from the dog’s point of view, which wags), then their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience, what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and the sneezing with the tail is linked in a direction rather with friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you react based on these experiences.”
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand their animal’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and guest scholarship at the University of Bristol’s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right are important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads left when they look at an aggressive dog, and right when it comes to a satisfied dog.
In another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada, “dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog if its ‘tail’ rolls to the left and not to the right, rather than getting restless – just differently than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore stir that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” Bradshaw said.
However, since their behavior is easy to record, it probably won’t take long until we understand why the cock sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to illness Alex Turners
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a gig in Glasgow after their lead singer became ill with concussion.
The band from Sheffield were due to play in the Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert has to be postponed.
The band’s announcement came after it had previously had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys will also have to cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
“Alex Turner was diagnosed with a concussion, which is why he unfortunately can’t appear.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, which was moved to Hydro in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconveniences that have arisen as a result.
Please contact the customer service at the point of sale where you purchased your ticket if you need further support.
Pope Francis appoints the first cardinals in February
On February 22, Pope Francis will for the first time appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who choose a pope, so Francis will thus appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election – this falls to a group of 120 “elective cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the announcement, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the consistory, was held.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of eligible cardinals is likely to decline by February.
He explained that a pope would usually appoint as many cardinals as necessary, so that the number of eligible cardinals would again be 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he would like.
The consistory next year is therefore significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, Valero said.
At present, there is a certain overlap on the sides of Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only have a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who are tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
“Francis has now chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He declared that it was “well possible” for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we haven’t been in this position – that’s all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would be called cardinals, but Francis stuck “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he is appointing”.
GM Calls Back New Pickup Trucks in the U.S. to Repair Seats
General Motors recalled nearly 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks in 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat, according to a statement from the U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulatory Authority on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for restoring the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Vehicle Safety Guidelines for head restraints.
“If the vehicle is pulled up from the rear, it is possible that the headrest does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury,” read the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading U.S. car manufacturer since the bankruptcy restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, rose 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Obama's Disappointment Voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republicans’ blockade tactics
Blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare’s website problems, drone attacks
Obama’s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a very sad book.
It’s a book that I believed would cheer me up during my thirty-second year of medical school and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes Barack Obama's memoirs for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient records in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and a speech could take my breath away.
The election was a landslide victory and news reporters held in order to keep an eye on the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates were crying with joy and my parents were collecting all the papers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had approval ratings of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening, as if you are being torn from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first cast my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just not something I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things Obama has achieved, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the enforced silence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I am also of the opinion that party-political blockade tactics have tipped off too many efforts with which our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
But after defending the Obama administration against colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have come to an end with my attempts at explanation.
I have reached a point of political desperation.
The republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows the interrogation of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are being punished that expose state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are being bypassed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House’s efforts to calm the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at 18 that government work could be contrary to its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the House of Representatives is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public discussion.
But when I look at the examples above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and inexhaustible alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard of for so long.
But with Obama’s approval ratings down to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become so tougher with this book.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to incur a serious loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania pre-elections.
In a meeting with the election assistants after the decision, he told his staff that they should come back on course and follow the purpose of their case.
“I want us to find our magic again,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more strongly.

Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 tax, made the claim as he wanted to clear questions from the table as to whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that are important for deciding whether to scrap or cut CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He’s in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets a vacation or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the election commission declared Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax with 53 votes in favor after the re-counting.
Palmer called for a review of the voting process to make it easier to get rid of.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn’t we have a system where you enter data into a computer, select it immediately, and then at 6:30 p.m. the result?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot.
Do you use them because you can then erase the results if you don’t like them?
Nowadays, matching pencils with pencils is incredible.
The Election Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy is an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “very seriously.”
A public office is about the service to the public.
“We do not seek any reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, according to two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global government investigation into the alleged manipulations of the currency market is rapidly taking off.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with the authorities on investigations in the world’s largest financial market, on which $5.3 billion a day is exchanged.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expansive investigation that the scandal is driving around the Libor interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
“Our investigations on this issue continue and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation said that the RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a former retailer to the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now expected to have been granted leave from his current position as European head of Forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was granted leave this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly a leading currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Usher’s Instant Message group was owned by bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, the people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it has taken steps against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market by a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that banks have agreed to in currency market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks have been combing through instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has stirred traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the deal and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders are of the opinion that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the huge daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks “can affect the market already with very low ticket prices”.
The message came out the same day Credit Suisse announced that she had cancelled this week a trader from her London Exchange Traded Funds office after he had caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them.
“We are confident that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained,” said Credit Suisse.
Painted the construction on the Bechtle foundation
A group of citizens' initiative "Swiss Wiese" has embellished the construction on the Bechtle grounds at the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and spread the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the collapsed house in the back of the property had not been allowed for security reasons, as the site was threatened to slide down.
Alfred Abel, who is currently managing the property, had agreed to the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent message with the message "We are for it" had been attached.
However, this did not disturb the approximately 20 members of the citizens’ initiative in their action.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against Bauruinen".
With this, she wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "building site" it became clear that some citizens believe that with the realization of the project of the city, many will be better off, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city continues to delay these answers, the BI says.
As you may have heard, the mayor’s public statements also have an effect.
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the exit for the thermal bath should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some seem to be frightened, others feel they are a “pumping blackmail attempt” on the population, the BI press release said.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick Shells for Schiris: Do not handle a swallow king
So pleased Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed, the sports director of the "Bullen" proved himself by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Svalbard Kings," he took the two offensive whistleblowers in protection at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3-0 against Gr<0xC3><0xB6>dig last Sunday, during which Senegalese reading became an alleged spectacle of the fallout - which was not, as the TV pictures showed.
"It's a gross failure," said Rangnick, who called the referee Harkam "completely over-demanding."
Harkam would have also contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Gr<0xC3><0xB6>dig coach Adi H<0xC3><0xBC>tter after the match.
He defended his German countryman decisively: "I would have behaved the same way as Roger Schmidt in every situation."
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the Scharm<0xC3><0xBC>tzel with H<0xC3><0xBC>tter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old said.
However, in the face of the race, Rangnick agreed to a praise hymn.
“There are only two words for this: really good,” he said.
There is not much to delay.
Above all, the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on like this.
There will hardly be any change in the winter transfer period.
There is no great reason to change anything.
"Except one player comes forward with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick said.
Supreme Court Confirms Obama's Health Act
It’s a big win for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely associated with Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces U.S. citizens to take out health insurance or pay a fine by 2014 – is constitutional within the framework of the state tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the House, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also held the view that the provision of the Health Act, according to which states would either have to extend the access requirements for medicaid or otherwise not to abolish all state medicaid subsidies.
The lawsuit against the law had been filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been decidedly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place is made light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunshine, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three giant reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a century’s dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" shouted Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremony on the TV2 channel.
Some of the inhabitants of the valley set up sun chairs, while others put on sunglasses for safety.
Until now, sun-hungry people had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
However, this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally approved the 5 million kroner (around 615 000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has provided the Italian alpine town of Viganella with winter sunshine for several years.
I can’t even read the post on Sundays.
“Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red dots for Sunday’s reading are still on different mailboxes of the core city and the districts, but you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find that the reading on Sundays and public holidays is no longer taking place with Ffiedt.
A request from the FDP has confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only in front of the post office building at Ernst-Ludwig-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e 36 and Jakob-M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e 1 in H<0xC3><0xBC>ttenfeld will be empty.
Whether Hofheim and Rosengarten are still being taught on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP’s request.
The Social and Youth Policy spokesperson of the FDP, Fritz R<0xC3><0xB6>hrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
Sunday education is an important postal service right at the post office.
"These thin out this undertaking despite the price increase for letters in January 2013 radically and unimaginably".
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberals’ factions and city associations, supports his group colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that here the learning times are being changed or even deleted."
The post office is miles away from the public.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschlo<0xC3><0x9F> and Rosengarten must be empty again on Sundays," says Bittner and R<0xC3><0xB6><0xC3><0xB6>hrenbeck unisono.
Also applicable to the core city, especially non-mobile citizens would have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday reading also on foot.
R<0xC3><0xB6>hrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration was planning talks with the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
However, there is also a Sunday lesson in Hofheim.
Her party has spoken out for privatisation.
"Then decisions will be made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt's parking fees are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become significantly more expensive.
The city’s magistrate is advising this morning on a presentation by traffic designer Stefan Majer (Green).
Accordingly, the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
For this, however, the prices should not be increased, but the time interval of parking hours and ticket machines should be shortened from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the town council will have to decide.
The Retail Committee of IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea".
The parking option right in front of the store is "a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller retailers".
The Transport Club of Germany believes that an increase after two decades is "reasonably appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick Actions Overwhelming hosts
With a narrow cadre, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to join the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG G<0xC3><0xB6>nningen from the Schw<0xC3><0xA4>biische Alb.
The <0xC3><0x84>lblers were on the other side with an experienced team.
Soon, however, it turned out that, even due to age, they were not able to keep up with the rapid actions of the happy cities.
The G<0xC3><0xB6>nninger were extremely difficult with the hard and placed stops.
Repeatedly, they missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz over the net centre and were not in place in the block defense.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the cheerful cities in all respects.
In the face of this crushing and play-by-play performance, the third set was then slightly beaten and won to the 3-0 final (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be a much more powerful opponent on the field on November 2 with the TV Baiersbronn, which could clearly get through in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik B<0xC3><0xA4>uerle, Yannik B<0xC3><0xBC>chle, Sebastian D<0xC3><0xB6>lker, Felix P<0xC3><0xA4>lchen, Stefan R<0xC3><0xA4>ller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and punctuation; even in the passes, the precision was sometimes lacking in goods and in some critical game scenes, the overriding prevented the view for possible punctuation.
However, in the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto, in this very well-balanced meeting, the great physical effort and a happy commitment of both teams was agreed upon.
Day of care at the small English hut
For the fifth day of care in the aftermath of the Natura 2000 project of Upper Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, on that day in the area of the hut the view into the valley should be cut open, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many hikers described this area as the highlight of the gorge, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect can also find the ecological consideration.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait of the Department of Nature Protection of the Government Bureau of Freiburg following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the wide view is covered with the aim of preserving the now-growing old common pasture with its specific protected habitat types through opening and connection to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
You will need these free connections for species maintenance.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss breaking a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
In this planning, the current measure is not only seamless.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised UNESCO status and thus a continuous complement to the life project and the current care days achieved for the future.
After these different interpretations, Christoph Wehle, head of reverie and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been struck in advance, and the forest tractor was ready to be picked up if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of warts and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the free view from the viewpoint.
L<0xC3><0xB6>ffingen: K<0xC3><0xB6>pfler is still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarst<0xC3><0xA4>dtchen L<0xC3><0xB6>ffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and seniors policy, as well as its own urban structures can be described as an attractive city, no second mayor candidate has yet been reported.
Norbert Brugger, the 46-year-old banker and business owner Dieter K<0xC3><0xB6>pfler from L<0xC3><0xB6>ffingen, is the only candidate to succeed the mayor who is no longer running for office.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, on Thursday filed a lawsuit alleging patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was banned by Nortel for insolvencies.
Rockstar, the consortium that had bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies over patent infringements before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been found guilty of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that aligns search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus meets the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are manufacturing phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and last offered $4.4 billion.
After it was superseded by Rockstar’s Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s library of patents.
“Although Google has failed to acquire the plaintiff’s patent at the auction, Google has violated the patent and continues to do so,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is demanding a high compensation from Google as it claims Google’s patent infringement is intentional, the indictment said.
Egypt Is Committing First Freely Elected Presidents
Mohammed Mursi is resigning, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political strife in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president and thus succeeded Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He laid the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes, who have his seat on the Nile and are imitating an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic,” Mursi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been banned from the organization since its inception 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and unlike the presidential prank of the Mubarak era, traffic was stopped only briefly so that the convoy could cross the usually busy road ahead of the city.
As an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all of those who wanted to target the efforts of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state today,” said Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, to the judges in the wood-plated chamber where he laid down the office seat.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was supposed to give his keynote speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem, which he listened to in a standstill.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of attendees in the largest auditorium of the university with speakers from “The Army and the People are a Hand”.
Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo has developed into a stronghold of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi made a symbolic oath on Friday on Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council has been seeking from the incumbent head of state.
But by putting the official oath before the court and not as usual before Parliament, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursis’ speech on Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season at the Falkenberger Discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On this Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on the next Saturday evening it continues with a <0xC3><0x9C> 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers on both days of course.
Workers Fall from Leader: Severely Injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder while exchanging a faulty external sensor and seriously injured himself.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a faulty heating sensor on the exterior facade of a guest house.
As he climbed onto the ladder attached to the roof, it slipped away and the man fell to the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Rape in South Africa: Two Lifelong Detentions
Nine months after the brutal rape and molestation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice life imprisonment on Friday.
This was reported by the SABC channel.
The victim later died from the consequences of serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act had triggered riots across the country.
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought for the victim’s survival for 14 hours, but unsuccessfully.
The view of the youth was so appalling that the nurses and nurses needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted to being in a bar the other night with Booysen.
He also confessed to beating them and raping them, but disputes that he is responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially assumed responsibility for several perpetrators, but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was not enough.
The prosecutor also stressed during the proceedings that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost everyday in South Africa: there are about 64,000 ads a year for sexual violence.
That’s almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has a significantly more population than South Africa (50 million).
However, police and women’s associations in South Africa estimate the dark figure in sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times higher.
Jumbo visits the black forest hams
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo", the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right from the start: the most important thing for the hams are the pig cages, Turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can hams that you get in every supermarket, so be a quality product?
Uli as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains how the company "Adler" in Bonndorf works.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and kittel it comes into the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can reach for the micro.
Jumbo seen for strengthening at fast-paced brisket in Waldshut
“I’m working a lot here,” the TV makers, Black Forest hams as a mass product, say.
16,000 Colognes per week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what the quality is all about.
Most pigs are slaughtered by six months of age.
Television with level?
Details such as the Ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH value.
“I’m looking forward to measuring Roberto Blanco, what happens next,” Jumbo said cynically.
Here the level of private television in pure culture is presented.
But it's still worth watching.
The viewer sees that the breaking down of the coils is still manual work.
Because: Black Forest hams are traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
The smoke tower and smoke firing visually remind Jumbo of a "sub-boat".
The trick: Tanning branches here provide in the smoke for the special taste of the black forest ham.
20 days in smoke make the hams almost black.
"Now the disk disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feed.
"It's really delicious," said the TV star's conclusion.
This will allow all those involved to live.
You thought travel agencies were part of the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to be opposed to the trend.
The company has increased its earnings outlook for the entire year and expects record revenue from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects a adjusted annual profit before taxes of between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are reached, that means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to a record profit of $290.4 million in the 2011/12 period.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and made a strong start to the second half, especially in the Australian and British private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well on track to record year-on-year income before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which are typically among our strongest earners.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, which equates to a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it was good for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while here also the business customers spend less.
The U.S. business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit for the full year is expected for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools will focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar.
In courses on English literature, students must treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The exam also includes “unseen texts” to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will have to take an independent GCSE language exam, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core compartments will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the supervisory authority for examinations, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech this summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there is “a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence,” stressing that the GCSEs would become “more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies show that in English schools, less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math test – combined with a stronger emphasis on the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to employ more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on "problems from the right life", including financial mathematics.
Attracting beautiful animals and delicious cakes
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and color strokes will present the circuit performance show this weekend in the town hall.
The reviews were already made on Thursday
Once again, the local association W514 organizes this large exhibition.
Breeders of the clubs in the Soest district here show their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobbyists their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges took the assessment of the numerous rabbits and were able to award outstanding animals.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
The next Ecumenical Forum on Monday, October 21, at the Neue Museum des Schloss is about the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological Reflections on Today's Dealing with the Last Things".
The rapporteur is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Churches of Salem, the Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to follow in the forum the question of how today people step up the “last things” after death.
Had the people in the past centuries been too aware of this, and in so doing put on those images of heaven and hell that "form our ideas to this day", the contemporary prophetic doctrine is characterized by the hopes of completion rather by a certain embarrassment or even a lack of language.
“The greater hope has been driven out by religious criticism among Christians,” she said.
She has "provided us with so many question marks that the call signs seem to have come down to us."
Johanna Rahner continues: “But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death.”
The question is related to that longing, "who dreams that in the end everything may be good."
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the University of Westf<0xC3><0xA4>lische Wilhelms-Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleine Heuberg confirm their creed at the firm
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the Soul Care Unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been signed.
In the morning, the Laudato-Si group accompanied the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the firmament, the young people said yes to their baptism and prayed for the power of the Holy Spirit.
The company members had been preparing for the big holiday in recent months, under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous community members.
In various projects, they learned about various tasks of the Christian community life and together they experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthralled participant
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to take the round course across the hills around the lake.
This is shared by Ulrich Knobel from the sporting club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially at short distances of over 15 kilometers and 300 meters in height, were also numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
These two were able to set themselves off from the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time lead to the goal and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was once again placed in second place.
For the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team Albtraum, who managed to get it right on the top of the ladder of victory.
In place two and three came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Drivers from Owingen.
A joyful development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
There were even more absolute top athletes at the start of the main race this year.
Four drivers were able to stand out from the regional top drivers.
Including Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl and a teammate have already been world champions twice in the twelve-hour race.
This year he became European Champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who has already named two German championships in the Duathlon, also has his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was a final eye-catching finish in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Just a second behind, the Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann were third in the overall ranking.
In the women's ranking, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
Areane Blersch secured second place from Binzwangen ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
Travelling through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical care to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people.
Match here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain and there caused a haematoma that was supposed to affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and yet not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell’s father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is for a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a doctor himself and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
In addition, he founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people force themselves in minibuses and ride on the roof with the cordoned medical equipment over unmounted terrain to the villages that need help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as heroes: a party, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and bee – with its broad smile and its boundless energy – is happy to be with the celebration.
The next morning, the team starts with the examination of hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per ride,” says Bwelle.
They come from a circle of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crucifixes, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document required for school, but many poor families simply can’t afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The surgeries usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning on Sunday.
It’s an exhausting mindset, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They’re drumming all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then drives back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free surgeries in the past year and knows that with its work, it makes a huge difference to the people it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a break-in he received now enabled him to work again.
“It changes the future of my family,” he said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in her second year and volunteers in Bwell’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and health care students like O’Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support bees, this is a chance to gain practical experiences they would never get at home.
“We can be involved in surgeries where we help drop blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies with them.
But if she is first in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
“He’s a hero without a doubt,” O’Malley said.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no boundaries.
For bee, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life, and thereby fulfilling a promise he made to his father, brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut on the body of Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hare in his craft, the acting art.
The old man Santiago can't do anything to catch fish.
The two complement each other simply great.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of whom the fisherman’s boy Manolo speaks.
If Santiago is tired of life bent on the chair, this is real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excels at.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately, through his knowledge and also his willpower, wins the fight against the fish.
Janson is on the stage as a soloist.
He manages to focus the audience’s attention on himself, so his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea consists only of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the active scene: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, which sings Cuba’s life feeling with her songs and her magnificent voice.
The four musicians play Cuba’s rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
At about 120 meters in length, a sewage canal from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne.
Those who visit Cologne will not pass by the cathedral.
Around 157 meters, the two towers project into the sky and make it the second tallest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors, who admire the two filigree church towers, suspect that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne’s underworld.
The meeting point for his tours is the service center of Cologne tourism directly at the Cathedral.
The tour begins very unspectacularly: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and so only that which was not too big stood out from the rest of the old city walls.
Therefore, most users of the parking lot rush past the Roman remnants today and only park their car.
But who looks more closely, in the park deck D2 discovers an archaeological site separated by metal grating rods.
You can see about five meters high of ruins made of handicrafted stones.
“It is the remains of the Roman city walls that were built in the second half of the first century AD,” Schulze says.
Before going back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper parking level take a look into a dark, 15-meter-deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which, unfortunately, is hardly perceived.
The nearest station of the tour is the Pretoria, and here the participants climb back down into the depths.
Here we experience the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the priest of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good German as much as "city of Roman law and city of the Agrippinists, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the praetorium is the former Palace of State Holders, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the lobby of the exhibition leads a tunnel access to the Roman sewage canal, which is preserved here at a length of about 120 meters.
"You can quietly walk a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze mutters the guests.
There's still a surprise for Schulze.
After getting the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16-meter-deep, walkable shaft.
“We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,” he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was indispensable for the ritual washings.
To this day, at the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by varying levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work will begin shortly.
However, a few more years will pass until completion.
Leg almost chopped off: re-release of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is rolled up again after more than four years.
A trial for attempted murder, dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Frankfurt (Oder) district court.
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent at the start.
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and then belonged to the Bandidos.
In June 2009, the prosecutor’s office accused them of stabbing and stabbing three men in a car with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were seriously injured, one man had almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hell’s Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
The advance was apparently a chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was a riot and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had been wearing masks and had not been identified.
The Bundesgericht (Federal Court) upheld the judgment after the review of the Prosecutor’s Office and referred it back to the Landesgericht for re-trial.
One of the defendants is currently in open court for another offence.
To start with, it was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes on the night of the event.
As a witness, the investigating commissioner at the time was invited.
In the center were phone calls from the accused and other persons who had been heard by the police.
It’s hard for rockers to stick to a law that’s more important to them than to say.
This also applies to victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had been discharged.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt State Prosecutor’s Office (Oder) said on demand that new traces have emerged since the last procedure.
Eleven further days of negotiations are set for the process.
The throwaway society does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the passenger and back seat, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or sect may be responsible for this!
What’s closer than being told to drive to the next drive-in in order to get a little bit?
I admit, I like to be there when it comes to fast food in the late evening or early morning.
A few potatoes, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and in bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers become noticeable.
Because what is missing that you regularly throw your fast food bags out of the car window?!
Especially on the weekends, discarded paper bags are located on roadsides and on parking spaces.
"Why?", I ask myself.
Are the people too deaf to take the bags home or to the next garbage bin?
It’s not just that the paper is shifting the landscape.
Bags have also already hidden traffic devices such as dashboards and thus caused accidents.
But about what "throwaway society" thinks, she probably doesn't even know what that word actually means.
If you are travelling more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after a busy night: clothes, bottles and other garbage storm there.
There would be a few bags more or less of nothing - unlike the street, where no one wants to tram on the food leftovers of other people.
I can already see the day when the cities and communities will become too stupid to let go - and the fast food chains will have to demand funds for their bags.
Obama's Reluctance in Health Policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama made a retraction yesterday in his often repeated, unambiguous pledge: “If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of resignation, the Republicans complained to the president in recent days that he had misled the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have working health insurance can keep them,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the cancellations, Obama urged those Americans who have received such messages to look at the free market for a new insurance policy.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
“They’re coming up with a better offer,” he said.
The government described it as unsurprising that the five percent of the population who have self-insured themselves would have to pay a different rate, as their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“I would like to say directly to these Americans: You deserve better,” Sebelius said at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement of a raised Sebelius to a consultant sitting behind her at yesterday’s hearing in the House of Representatives was recorded after a dispute with Republican Rep. Billy Long from Missouri, whether she should be required to attend Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly pressed the question of why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily waive state-sponsored insurance to end a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air base
An American government official, who wanted to remain anonymous, told CNN on Thursday that Israeli warplanes had attacked an air force base in Syria’s Latakia a day earlier.
The target was "missiles and related equipment", which the Israeli government feared were destined for Lebanon's Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab Al-Arabiya channel, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot on Wednesday night, and the Israelis were responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which Russian S-125 Newa defense missiles as well as a battery of SA-3 missiles, which, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry explosive heads up to 70 kilometers.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quoted a similarly anonymous Israeli government official with the words, he believes that Israel carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesman for Israel’s Defense Ministry said: “We do not comment on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah earlier, in part successfully.
The Israeli government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons means crossing a “red line” that would be followed by a military response.
John Kerry said in an unprecedented statement that the US spying had "beyondly gone too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected concurrence, hinted at softening the U.S.’s defensive stance on its surveillance programs by saying the spying had in some cases “gone too far.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, was responsible for turning on “autopilot” when whistleblower Edward Snowden’s explosive revelations about NSA spying became public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has entered a diplomatic storm of dissatisfaction on the part of its allies.
Speaking at the Open Government conference in London via video link, Kerry said: “The president and I, along with others in the government, have learned quite a few things that have happened almost by autopilot, simply because of the ability to do so, which still goes back to the Second World War and the Swede years.”
He later admitted as the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government that the U.S. spying had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, “In some cases, it has gone too far.”
The President is determined to create clarity, and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process are not affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added: “We’re dealing with a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is eating to kill people, to blow up and attack governments.
So what if you were able to catch and stop that before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings, and the murder of people because we have learned of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about the alleged U.S. spying and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the U.S. in the anti-terrorism efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board as we work together against terrorism,” said Murphy, who is sitting in the Senate as a Democrat for the first time and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Angels in Washington.
Furthermore, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their annoyance about the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has recorded millions of phone data in Europe have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence service this week declared the reports to be inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata gathered by NATO allies and the United States.
Other disclosures cited Snowden’s leaked documents, after the NSA monitored the phone of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state around the world.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the spying on allies as necessary and declared that this was common on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said his authority is preparing for the Congress trip to take place this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary will still be worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also said there would be some “serious words.”
He said European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spying programs they have been using for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to deal with the fact that we are not the only ones spying,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the squabble over the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance activities.

Australian woman indicts jail in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, filed an appeal against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 of making a false statement after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver had arrested her in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10, while she was suspected of having raped her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
Police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to having made up the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody on the spot.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security facility on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian Rubgy League player who turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back to Australia.
“Of course we are very worried, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 baht on free foot.
In Australian reports it was to be read that she is vacationing in the meantime in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand.
The court heard that Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of travel shopping woman Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand might be trying to improve his impacted tourist image, and it therefore comes to an end.
