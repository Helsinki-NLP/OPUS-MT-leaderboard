Obama welcomes Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Tehran’s destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
The meeting, however, is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s ongoing settlement building and casts Netanyahu’s lack of will in the peace process.
The deal over Iran’s nuclear program, announced by Obama, has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu had delivered a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republicans before the U.S. Congress, which was partly considered an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected, with reference to his upcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor admits to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a somewhat clumsy voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was inscribed on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could make it back, I loved Amy and she was the only woman who ever loved me, and she was the only woman that ever loved me.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said that Lamb made the fateful emergency call sometime after that.
By the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his life when the police locked him up.
One day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped draw an image of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal prehistory.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty includes 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s employment policy meant that the promotion, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not be a guarantee for him of an automatic path to an employment as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing the campus, police later found Lambs' trail when he re-imported to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38-caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent's home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his PhD in Education in the spring.
One of Lambs’ long-time friends called him intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing for a few years.
At the time, he was the women’s swaram.
All the girls melted away when he was there," said Hairston, now 40, and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife", but there was no certificate of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the Backstein House, which adjoins a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss’ ex-husband, Shawn O’Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends remained and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer market three years ago.
Later they played together one or the other gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica game in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the dead professor, ran the first-semester seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the memorial service, while the university scores sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The lesson will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to move our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency call referred to Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two had ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many Christmas season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products dealer says it will give the current employee and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country. In the Christmas period, 45,000 more workers were hired in 2014.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox joking about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was professionally a big moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it becomes increasingly clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me,” he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, Back in Time.
The movie begins, and I think I’m a simulated fence and an arm’s length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "indisputably the greatest time travel movie ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the splits in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have shown in the handling of the crisis in Syria when reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Surveys That Show Donald Trump Is To Be Taken Seriously
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others have dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks in polls, it hasn’t (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the two-digit field, and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomination of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry’s leadership was given to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom won even a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump’s sustainability and begin to let their dollars flow to plunge him.
Here are some recent surveys that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the property mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
These numbers are in the early states.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "angry" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "unsatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the establishment's favorite, was the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation’s first pre-election state, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality of a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to effectively run his office, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they set up their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who will win the GOP nomination the most, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
That’s a change since four out of ten July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the final cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to just 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a large number of GOP voters view Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump garnered the majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday showed that just over half of voters who support Trump say they’ve given their votes firmly.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change their mind.
46% said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Yet Trump’s strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rape” in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration was the turning point in public discourse to 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic expression will keep key Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and damage reorientation efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do the same.
Frustration over the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now missing about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly due to their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new ABC/Post Monday poll that they would rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are also angry at Washington.
A survey by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent “unsatisfied” and 21 percent “holly angry.”
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg you will find the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea Watt.
On the road, a square meter of a reed roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"At Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited," says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows which particular layers cost a square meter the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student booth in Munich are not really little.
Unlike Germany’s top residential areas, one of the prices is like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & V<0xC3><0xB6>lkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros of nothing - per square meter, well noted.
But good, who can afford it...
By the way, Munich is not at the top here, by the way.
Champions League: Bayern's dream start thanks to M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and G<0xC3><0xB6>tze
Double goalscorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas M<0xC3><0xBC>ller has just one run.
A happy match by Thomas M<0xC3><0xBC>ller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it ran.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and Mario G<0xC3><0xB6>tze have given FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the witch cage of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening game in the Champions League with the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to M<0xC3><0xBC>ller's double pack (52./90.+2) and G<0xC3><0xB6>tze's hit (89.) earning 3:0 (0:0).
The series’ twelfth start-up is set to be the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola wants to finally get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third round.
M<0xC3><0xBC>ller received good help from Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto in his 28th match in the Champions League to lead Bayern, who had a shot of the world champion thought to be a flank.
"We won't underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game at Karaiskakis Stadium ahead of 31,688 hot-flowered fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a focused and engaged idea without having to shine.
Piraeus had won his last six home games in the king class, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1:3) also played here.
But Bayern, undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They ran bravely, but often too unimaginably to work in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by moving the game to the left, Douglas Costa, who rarely made it through against former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
M<0xC3><0xBC>ller was more fortunate from the right than his flank from the right half-field in the upper left corner.
In the 67th minute, the World Champion gave the possible 2-0.
The best chances in half one was Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiacos striker Ideae Brown hit Poland's headball off the line (26th).
Then by direct shot, Torwart Roberto paired with the knee (35).
Although the Bavarians raised their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to put needlesticks.
But Manuel Neuer was loyal to goalkeeper.
For example, when he pointed a shot of Ideae over the latte (56.).
Prior to Newer, Guardiola had a four-chain defense with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario G<0xC3><0xB6>tze, after muscular problems back in the frame, sat first outside.
The World Cup hero gave green light only after the final training, Sports Director Matthias Sammer told "Sky": "If you want to make something else out of it, that's already evil".
Guardiola also decided against him on the first move when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beaten Lewandowski (59).
G<0xC3><0xB6>tze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and 13 minutes later made everything clear, by 11 meters M<0xC3><0xBC>ller put another one on it.
Before the game it had come to the stadium to crawl.
After a smaller group of partially mummified Bavarian fans in their audience block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with blows against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was injured and was transported from the stadium.
Who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke not only harm their lungs, but also their teeth - this is close to a long-term study in Potsdam.
The good news is that if you give up, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evident from the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research (DifE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely was 2.5 to 3.6 times higher for smokers.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth decay are caries and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE emphasizes.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent inflammation of the gums in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who quit smoking, however, could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the “Journal of Dental Research”.
However, it could take over ten years for the risk to return to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham.
One has to convince people to become non-smokers, said study leader Heiner Boeing of DifE: "Smoking shortens the lifespan."
Not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and according to our findings also leads to good dental health up to a high age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by tooth decay, the DifE said.
Earlier studies had already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth decay.
The new long-term study underpins the findings.
Archaeologists clash with Cologne-based Rheinufer on remnants of the Late Antiquity
Archaeological finds have been made on the right-hand side of the Rhine River in Cologne.
Near the site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings, museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground memorials.
For all construction projects in the Cologne city district, the museum is always added as an office for archeological soil care.
In the third building section of the Rhine boulevard, archaeologists have now been found.
It has already been known from text documents that there was a fortress on the site in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman caught by freight train
After a young woman at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern is injured, the federal police are asking the population for help.
Early Wednesday morning at about 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the track from the train station building coming at the end of the train and was caught by a freight train coming from M<0xC3><0xB6>nchengladbach.
By recording the train, she suffered the most serious injuries, according to the Federal Police.
She was treated on-site notarized and taken to a hospital by rescuers.
There are no findings on the reason for the young woman’s nightly crossing of the tracks.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Inquiries come residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelb<0xC3><0xA4>ckerweg, Thomashofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e and Leiffarther Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e (L364).
Information about the cause of the accident can be provided under the Federal Police hotline on 0800/6888000 or any other police station, which is connected around the clock and free of charge.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private dispute settlement facilities for disputes between groups and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system, which corresponds to significantly more traditional courts in its functioning.
“We want to set up a system that citizens trust,” EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr<0xC3><0xB6>m said at the meeting.
Sweden intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government has announced its support.
TTIP aims to create the world’s largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically provide for the EU states and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They are supposed to come from the EU, the US and third countries alike.
A second instance is also provided for the first time.
It would allow you to object to judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed on arbitrators, there was no possibility of opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion over the past months, it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmstr<0xC3><0xB6>m commented.
In the long term, she wants to work on an international investment court.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clarified.
The investor-state arbitration procedures (ISDS) demanded by large corporations in particular are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice through which companies can dispute damages at the expense of taxpayers, repeal national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first statements, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the EU Commission’s proposals as insufficient.
Above all, it was criticized for not applying to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as major progress.
The Commission takes into account key points in the reform, which the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel drew up with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration courts is from the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmstr<0xC3><0xB6>m’s plans.
The European Association of Enterprises BusinessEurope warned against restricting the opportunities of the economy through too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular could be adversely affected, it said.
When the talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) could be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been going on since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year.
This date is no longer valid.
Delicate people of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to it is a flip chart on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with a felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost seized by Steven’s lecture.
He tells about his meticulous and delicately arranged songs, based on various places he records on the map.
Where they were born and what it looks like there, in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative fool.
With the 2003 release and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear that are harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
It is rumored that "Michigan" would be the first part of a failed series: each of the 50 U.S. states would be eventually conceived.
But already in 2004 and near Rhein, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and is breaking certain expectations positively.
Reduced Stevens appears here.
Live enough for him guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinois") a comprehensively celebrated masterpiece was released in 2005.
Overwhelming with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album climbs to the American Billboard Charts and is missing in no annual charts of the influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then relies on "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic offset pieces.
This sixth decent studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
As long as the smaller clubs emerge, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon star bands and large fluorescent stage endings.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-headed band.
In the dark kept hamburger More!
He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now seated in their chairs, Stevens, who has become much more mature, returns to intimacy and to the people.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you hear: The lecture is "more popular" and so you can throw away the "plate in the end".
Only thanks to Stevens’ humbleness, he plays acoustically a few older songs and finally succumbs to growing applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn’s debut will be eagerly awaited at the Prime Minister’s Question Time
The new Labour chairman Jeremy Corbyn is set to make his debut at the prime minister’s questioning hour and settle for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will stand up to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely being reviewed by the media and Labour MPs from close quarters.
He called for "less theater and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip a few sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn’s leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour chairman’s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the National Anthem chanting at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is at the center of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "standed in respectful silence" and acknowledged the "heritage of the Royal Air Force in the air battle around England".
But a member of Mr Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC’s Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour president to sing the national anthem “independently” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn’s top team, relying on differences in economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacked" within Labour, according to Mr Corbyn's statements on the position on the European Union and the limitation on profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is making changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labour and pension minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government's plans to reduce the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour president to have faced David Cameron, since he was Tory chief, across the Dispatch box in parliament in the last decade.
The Labour chairman, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has “crowd-sourced” ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the prime minister’s questioning hour is too confrontational, and that he will both stop “beating” and arguing with renegades and instead focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr. Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economy minister, will represent him if he does not participate - for example, if Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also brought up the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the floor, and that he had addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to get rid of politics in the style of a "Casperle theatre", which is often associated with the prime minister's question hour, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of a leader’s judgment and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his colleagues, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
'Shooting in Joburg': homeless youth trained as photographers
The city center of Johannesburg is a bustling place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn a living.
"I What Shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound rises due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound jumped to data showing an increase in the UK’s wage growth, and the FTSE 100 was boosted by the SABMiller bidding target.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This percentage was the fastest since 2009 and generated estimates about the time of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a 20% jump after the takeover bid of rival AB InBev had been received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher, according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – are reporting growth again.
Shares of Glencore rose by 5 percent after the mining giant said it had taken $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the largest losers on the index, down 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had set his valuation for the company's rating on "sell".
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are jeopardizing expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.”
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The costs could hit the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: Auf Bieber-Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
L<0xC3><0xA4>ppische 21 years young, a henfling with super-cheeked fries.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More than even more.
Mr. Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going through.
Like Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard of the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
However, since 7 a.m., the poline has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber Building: Here you live the idol, whose poster hangs high in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite, where the Canadian singer lives, costs just as much a day as her mother Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "Actually, my Victoria would have to sit in the tenth grade in high school."
"I fulfill her a dream."
School duty?
Who's juicing?
Not the fans.
Not even Bieber himself.
He took care of it anyway.
For advertising in the Superbowl's advertising break, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle firm flushed many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the store table, Bieber also cashes.
When Justin Bieber drinks a cup of coffee, you stare at the window sill.
More than 100 million people are said to have used it that way.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is finally in the US and UK with his new single "What do you mean?" at #1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is due to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida Poster Brings Lebanese to Potato Fields Idea
Potatoes or donuts?
It goes both ways – in the potato field toner developed by Oldenburger Imbiss owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the phrase "potato instead of doughnut" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a plate.
The idea was brought to him by a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the caption "Cartoons instead of Doners", which he had seen by chance on television.
Since then, there has been a barbecue in his shop, which is equipped with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," Alhay says.
The idea has now been registered with the Lebanese patent office in Munich.
There, according to the authorities, it has recently been protected as a pattern of use.
Therefore, how much meat and how much potatoes the spit contains, Alhay does not want to betray.
Only so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
Culinary international understanding is also well received by its customers.
Metcash Launches Ground Instancy Campaign to Combat Aldi Invasion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi surge in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground-breaking campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing for the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via Ezia.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice maker Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes samples in IGA stores and shop owners selling the discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the retailer for food, alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy day.
There’s a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the Eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that after 12 months of opening its first markets, Aldi will snap away about five percent of the food market in these two states and remove sales from all existing actors, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and achieve sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and the amounts on Metcash’s high fixed-cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in interest and tax gains, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market shares in the Eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash’s sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly respond to Mr Douglass' comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash’s food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction while simultaneously pushing for revenue and margins.
However, the wholesaler refuses and invests more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and IGA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and a better selection of private labels.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says the price adjustments and store remediation programs will be added to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, in the opinion of Australian tennis association president Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", came into the limelight through Kyrgios' infamous confrontation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaiming, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis bat after a bang destroyed a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was permanently defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
“One thing that I’m pretty proud of is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a bit drawn into the dispute,” Healy said.
He broke a batsman when he lost in the U.S. Open due to a cramp, but he’s not the first player to break a batman out of Frust with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he’s not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a little too harshly.
He’s a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in the team and so on, he’s never had a problem with the other players, he’s respected in the dressing room, he’s trained hard, he’s well in shape, he’s going to be a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves his own.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important pre-decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return as a long-term fixture to the team."
"First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think that Nick very quickly managed to make the ascent, which is what people like Federer and Murray have pointed out to him. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we can try to support him, we try to do his hand
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and blocked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained all those who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man’s-land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled from violence were trapped for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But the frustrations increased.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted "Open the Border!" and chanted insults against the Hungarian readiness police.
Some rejected food and water from protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister said it was “unacceptable” that migrants would be sent back from Hungary as more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc could not agree on a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overcrowded Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would take another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not place its hopes on an immediate action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency, which was declared on Tuesday in two southern regions, gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were employed in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, Hungary has become a major entry point into the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most arriving economic refugees are looking for a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - an opinion strongly opposed to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-meter (13-foot) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher prison sentences for human trafficking.
"Due to the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
The parliament has yet to technically agree to the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters from the Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, the country’s security adviser for Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already entered deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a tractor-trailer with barbed wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people’s data and pressured a crowd to enter it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead to Bernie Sanders halved in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins over her on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the pre-election (58 percent before), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (increase by 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters in the polls.
More than five months before the start of the pre-election, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is firm, which candidates they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton holds a great advantage among women and moderates, but these advantages have decreased.
Her support for the men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind here.
Clinton’s advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has been averted, and she and Sanders are now on the same level.
However, Clinton still has a big lead among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in that group.
About half of Democratic voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton – only about a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say so about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it’s time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she’s the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to deal with the problems and selectability are also cited.
As the vice president throws a potential for the presidential office into the scales, 57 percent of Democratic voters want to see him in the race – though a third believe he shouldn’t.
When democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the forefront.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s lead will increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, that number has dropped from 78 percent in the last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most select" has increased.
However, when asked what is more important to a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about the eligibility.
Similar to last month, no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable for these voters of the pre-election.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features in the voters of their party’s pre-elections.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is best at cutting the three candidates off with honesty, while Clinton’s strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don’t believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don’t have an opinion about him.
Democratic voters in the general election also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server continue to be asked during her term as Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say it didn’t affect their views at all.
But it’s a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no impact on their general opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinion of Clinton had worsened.
They’re mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party’s voters, this remains a problem for them among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters across the country see Trump as being dishonest and unreliable.
However, Clinton and Trump get good grades in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush are best cut off in honesty.
A majority view Sanders as being honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the pre-election is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson appears in a nationwide poll close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson is behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates are now missing half of the support of voters in the new poll, and others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide, growing from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month to 27% in the Tuesday poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The survey also found that Carson is good at demographic groups and Trump outperforms Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been cut off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen most deeply, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll, released last week, shows that Carson is rising in the polls — landing at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side elevations for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathers to find still warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some do not go into the sea anymore: Maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, reports the German Weather Service (DWD).
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees.
Five members of the fraternity charged with the death of a Baruch College Neulings
Almost two years after a student died during a shaky ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi fraternity brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he was loaded with eyes tied to a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked as he tried to reach a target via a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of headaches, then he unconsciously died.
Members of the Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng became disabled and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had the time to change Deng’s clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood’s national president, to seek advice, Chief of Police Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
“At this point, members began to hide utensils and put the well-being of the fraternity in principle over that of Michael Deng,” said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly involved in blunt force injuries to the head, torso and thighs.
“Too many families have been destroyed by the brotherhood’s harassment, at least one student has been dying of the harassment every year since 1970,” Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family, said in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County Grand Jury recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with chicane attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We don't just want to hold the people involved accountable, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also hold them accountable," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity has revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates.
An increase in interest rates is coming, and the house will be shaken, yields for bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the process.
A recession came within 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted for 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial institutions react.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start raising interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could find that the whole excitement due to an increase in interest rates may have been exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the “cheap money” era,” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a statement to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal levels, but still to a low level, leading to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy might react based on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the past month, pre-emption of interest increases can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for asset income to be skewed 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study about what happens after interest increases from the Fed.
More precisely, the market is mostly on the uptrend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to management to increase interest, quite flat in the 250 days after (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past 14 percent passed by.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the yield begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the Fed’s interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 have only doubled the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed, only 1.5 percent.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question "whether this time it's different," the Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have focused all year on an increase in interest rates from the Fed, and all eyes were on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the futures trading only indicates a 25 percent probability.
“In our study, all of the increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and put pre-recession levels very quickly in the shadows after recovery began,” the report said.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is so far 74 months.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, the yields appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, the Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to yields between longer and shorter bonds collapsing closer and leading to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate, although “we are still careful to expect higher yields,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
“Besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded and volatility has increased – all the features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.
Largely and entirely, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will benefit from rising interest rates and becoming more attractive to local products.
Multinational companies with high debt will face worse as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debt.
“The story shows that “quality” stocks tend to respond extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate increase,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Firms with strong balance sheets have exceeded 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital yields and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains from higher yields, even if experts are of different opinion on how fast this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative member of parliament criticized the broadcaster for its "disgusting"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they only imitated The Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "converts" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he is doing something the private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public-law radio station is "stupid" and increasingly no longer distinguishable from its commercial competitors.
“Radio 3 doesn’t seem — I don’t like using the word ‘fuck’ — but it seems to turn into Classic FM,” he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be just under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different — these are two spontaneously named examples where you’re actually just imitating what’s already on the market,” Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director General dismissed the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness.
What I learn from Radio 3, I won’t learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there’s a commitment to live music and music that’s really unsurpassed.
“And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works, I also really think it’s important,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that more work needed to be done to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that, during the hearing on the Committee for the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport, came under fire to step on the feet of the commercial rivals.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice – the BBC’s musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "on special BBC wisdom".
He added that he wants the company to “find a hit from our home stable” when it launches an entertainment series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the ordering of further series of The Voice in the future or spend money on other entertainment formats by the fee payers.
Internet sales rose the slowest in August, and Black Friday could be responsible for this.
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
In the last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in the year 2000
Online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday has slowed spending in November
Virtual shopping has boomed for over a decade, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August showed the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000, with only a five percent increase over the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 then that has always evolved over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now this is collapsing, and we may experience that growth is shrinking.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers will withhold their purchases from this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of shoppers around their computers was five times cut to make their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which buyers struggled for bargains, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of <0xC2><0xA3>5 spending was spent a little more than <0xC2><0xA3>1 online.
In some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims Bury Those Killed in Mecca in Crane Accident - Bin Laden's Family Sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca by the streets
Saudi Arabia blames the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane fell.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane fell at Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Regrettably, mostly dressed in white, filled the trail to pay their respects when the first of the dead joined their last trip to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The grieving process passed at the Holy Place, where only days before a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the beds.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the Bin Laden family's construction company over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beekeepers who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, the father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsh in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Haddesh to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
King Salman said today that the Bin Laden group should not have left the crane’s arm when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Bin Laden group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's management of foreign travel is prohibited.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane, which crashed into an inner courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hajj, which takes place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the cranes, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also fined the group for non-current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca’s Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over larger construction projects.
The late leader of al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a distraught son who was disfellowshipped from the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain, just days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million Rials (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to be paid to the relatives of the dead and the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss Says The Time of Cheap Eastern European Craftsmen Is Over
Britons are increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled artisans from Eastern Europe has increased
This will lead to the opening of 200 more screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher 60 B&Q outlets will close nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British lay down their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes.
If you can deal skillfully with a hammer or a brush to strike walls, nowadays you seem to belong to a minority.
Because Britons are increasingly employing artisans to carry out domestic worker jobs in their homes, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled artisans from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has now been surpassed.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops targeting artisans and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms Laury said she wants to hire more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the employees are mostly men.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that are making more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: “There is still a majority of men working in our stores.
We need to move this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying items by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK company listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has employed exactly 50 percent of the women’s team, including its management and chief financial officer.
Mrs Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in the half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
At the Klagenfurt Landesgericht on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-master Aich/Dob had to be held responsible for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants did not plead guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was acquitted of the charge in May of this year.
The current process has been delayed.
According to Attorney General Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, the defendants used funds from association accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also charged with financial misconduct.
This fact was revealed by the chairman of the Sch<0xC3><0xB6>ffensenatt, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
To cast out the infidelity, the defense was that the association had not at any time created a downturn in assets.
The sports officials would have only paid compensation and the sports club for which they were active from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money out of debt – the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44,000 in 2001).
"At that time, we were faced with the situation: Are we going to continue the club or do we block it?", said one of the defendants, who was a big business examiner at the finance department.
With his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
“We’ve put money in front of us, put our life insurance as security at the bank,” he said at the time of the acceptance.
It has been agreed with the association: you can freely manage the money, it can only be done no debts.
Furthermore, in the case of the corresponding financial situation, the payment of the compensation for expenses was decided retroactively until 1991.
As a result, some of the compensation was paid years later, namely from 2003, when a plus had been on the account.
As a result, parcel and non-detail bookings also appeared, the former Obmann explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, the second defendant said.
Why the withdrawals had not been disclosed to the association in detail, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial agreement, it was important that only the debt-freeness was, according to the answer.
When an official investigation into abuse of office began in 2011, an amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>120,000 was transferred to the club’s account.
This was a setback, the defendants said.
This securities account was held in the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association according to its statement.
“Why?” the judge asked.
The respondent did not know the answer to this question for a long time.
Then he finally thought he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the prosecutor put it in the room.
The accused was informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer has been formulated as a "damage recovery".
Why the damage?, the judge and public prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never caused any harm.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "With that, you're all out of the tailor."
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said he never paid a cent, he only paid for miles and diets.
He charged the club <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 per month on diets, but the actual expense was much higher, he added.
Accurate documents for the early years could not be provided by the defendants.
These were no longer retained after an operating test in which everything was judged to be correct, they explained.
The second defendant had also received a kilometre payment.
All the corrections were carried out in cash, for which he had to drive from his place of residence V<0xC3><0xB6>lkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he said in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on 23 September with the examination of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard expands 30,000 jobs
In addition to the personnel reduction that has been going on for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs in the division of the company.
The job postings at the U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) are not over.
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer base.
As a result, costs of $2.7 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.4 billion) will be saved, the company said on Tuesday.
The move will lead to a special strain of around $2.7 billion, which will hit as of the fourth quarter.
The 55,000 job cuts that have been going on for the past three years have not yet been completed.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP still employed around 302,000 employees.
The Hewlett-Packard share declined by 2.3 percent.
The printing company from Palo Alto, California, is currently growing up with printers: this is how the computer and printer business will be bundled into a new company this year – separate from the more powerful areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services last year added the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo.
In the third quarter of July, PC and printer sales declined by 11.5 percent.
Revenue fell 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
This led to a return of revenue in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds with a split and massive job postings to the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, only responded late that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans are expected to cut some 55,000 jobs in total.
Conflicts: Majority Supports Anti-IS Training Mission
However, a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be mostly rejected: 54 percent spoke out against it, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other countries are flying air strikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
Twenty-four per cent are opposed to interfering in the conflict.
A collaboration with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad rejected 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would do so.
29 percent couldn’t decide.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The focus of the fair is on connected, self-driving cars as well as electric mobility until 27 September.
After two days of press, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Mobility Connects" on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the VDA Auto-Verband expect about 900,000 visitors, as they did two years ago.
R<0xC3><0xB6>szke: Rape on the Serbian-Hungarian border
Hungarian police have deployed several hundred refugees at the Serbian border near R<0xC3><0xB6>szke Tr<0xC3><0xA4>engas and water throwers.
Euronews correspondent D<0xC3><0xA1>niel Bozsik has witnessed the violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
A police line had formed behind it, and a water thrower was behind the police.
40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officials first used non-stop pepper spray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
So the group was dissolved.
The refugees have now retreated somewhat in anticipation.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was dragged out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas cried.
Other refugees sank into each other and suffered from shortness of breath.
Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. bank
The world is watching when the U.S. note bank comes together on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision as to whether interest rates will be raised for the first time in nearly a decade or not.
A survey of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that a little more than half, who were still in the view last week that the Fed would do so, now thinks that the Fed will last a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25%.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed put interest rates on NULL.
“For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank might leave the zero area and start a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is at a relatively good performance level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and only generate low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned markets to opt for an increase, but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision will be announced at 8 p.m. on Thursday.
Deadly shooter at Delta State University leaves letter of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning—and before he shot and killed his colleagues later in the day—Shannon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that it was “sad to do” at the first murder and wanted to announce “he could do something wrong.”
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning.
and said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency department employee that the police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" was in the house, but that "no one will bother" but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it to him.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday that the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" of a "three-way relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said they were married for about seven years as a "good man."
The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19, and she was "destroyed on the ground".
He said that Prentiss's daughter was "absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail".
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car aside, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as stated on the university’s website.
Stars who have lost their lucky bearer
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also reportedly has to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this surely demands his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa to rebuild the Group
Lufthansa is planning to build a large group.
Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save on its own with a better organisation.
150 of the world’s approximately 1000 executives will cost the Group building the workplace.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its corporate structure and reassessing Eurowings’ cheap daughter.
The goal of the re-alignment is a profit contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline said on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business in the future.
The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be in charge of Eurowings in the management team around Chief Carsten Spohr in the future.
With the refurbishment, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000 employees of the strong company has been complex.
The airlines signed under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the tariff conflict with the Pilots' Association Cockpit (VC), negotiations are scheduled to resume on Thursday after the court-stopped strike.
This was shared by the union.
The topic of the talks is the retirement plan for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible “in a year with a predicted record result”.
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to several strikes in recent months.
The background is in addition to the transitional supply of the pilots the concept of savings "Wings".
In the fight against competitors, Lufthansa plans to divest routes to the Eurowings airline.

Manchester United's Luke Shaw can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left outside defender to tears and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be deployed tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, it's very hard and then plays fantastically, and then it happens.
In the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an elf meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the judge, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an elf meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I will come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
With the European Championship in France, the England defender has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player with this type of injury leaves the place, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and then if you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn’t see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foul by Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know the Lorax better?
It’s one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won’t take long until you know it almost thoroughly.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss's 1971 environmental fable.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: “funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it’s a book that I like to read to my children because it always seems to give an image or a message that we’ve missed so far.”
Everything is fine and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the book's action, instead reproduces a content entry of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling his desire to see a real tree, but was silent, and his love interest was fulfilled."
As if that were not yet suspicious enough: The text submitted by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website and so begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, hope is a boy
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book. Here an unnamed boy hears, like the local environment through the money-loving, falling trees, thneed-striking once-ler sneezing in spite of the protests of the name of the loch
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron’s polling station.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron’s employees, but did not make any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
Hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the squad that England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my card.
I would not rule out an outside victory.
Alastair Cook’s site may be less experienced than those three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setup, and the community spirit is strong; they won’t wear scars from 2012, just a youthful-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at the test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth resigns from the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyze.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because — and I have said this before — players are their own best picks.
A long time ago, Lyth's run would have been extended, but he had control over his own destiny.
If he's hoping to make another run for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his position, even though he didn’t perform so well, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test hitter gets to put his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away games.
The only charge that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in top form – but this lost chance now lies in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hit man that I highly appreciate.
He is an X-Factor cricketer, what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge spot, which hit us a lot.
He needs to get at least the same chances as the ones before him, but this obviously depends on teaming up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to beat Moeen next to Cook, which would bring an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, popped up, and I have nothing against it.
I don’t see why a batsman can’t beat there, and this left-hander has already shown that he’s a hell of a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is no big difference there.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He managed three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the frame as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealing with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his stats – an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball – and think it’s a point, but there’s no large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have chosen youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the team, England has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a mastercoup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I’ve always felt he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind, even if the messages are in line with what has been said before.
Colly’s teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not employed at the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that for my part.
Some won’t agree, but coaches and team members don’t set the schedule.
And you have to keep in mind that, as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not easily made by the heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit <0x3D> Britain's exit from the EU) could gain entry if the economy goes into turmoil by 2017
David Cameron’s unrivalled renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day, even without the choice of genius Jeremy “Is it yes or no?” Corbyn to lead Labour or the TUC, which is fiercely fierce for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is now and not always, are fed up with their own debt, Britain’s self-created agenda of split concessions and disruptive treaty changes, which they usually don’t want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it also did not like it when it threatened social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie agenda.
Prime ministers and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they are winning allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK looking outside inside the EU tent – “Don’t let us be alone with France,” says Berlin – and lets see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don’t care whether we stay.
Germany’s cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened to the overly long-suffering ones like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also an amazing force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left.
It’s hard to imagine that they’re going to tear themselves apart to help the selfie-readers whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland’s exit from the UK – something they don’t want to do because most similar separatist tendencies have.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally not plan to make any helpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, while Britain’s 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a plea" and "the UK has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and which EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were during Tony Benn’s 1975 referendum that supported our entry in 1973 with a 2:1 ratio.
You may faintly remember Boris Johnson, the ore-euro opportunist who made a name for himself as an “EU straight banana” Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
With all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fearing crooks, phone-hacking foreigners, and the Pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought similar about it, but found that when you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum swirling, because Blair had laid the principle of the EU’s unappealed constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus knocking him a back door.
The press has never forgiven him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on the back on Monday in Westminster – I told him he doesn’t need more time to waste for me – seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock’s Boycott Murdoch strategy of the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I express it kindly - in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip’s traditional blue dye trend and the wild fields of Tory’s Little Englandism can probably say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week as the trailfinder struggled in him not to admit that Corbyn's appointment as the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues on television without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay “under all circumstances” — Benn’s expression — was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his opponents and MPs after all the reports at her closing meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever Corbyn’s stirring bottom-up image wants to convey – remember that it even touched me – News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the slums of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe, which allows him to hold Labour's support in the referendum campaign for a self-evident, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental ambiguity about EU membership – in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of the petty-bourgeois is a fundamental difference.
As with his multi-pronged views on NATO – Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to leave – foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a meaning for their superiors at home in everything.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, they also have suspicious voters, to make concessions to the British, if all this can be meaningless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, something I was reminded of at the start on Monday of what the British Influence Security Forum called itself.
Experts Criticize Public Health England Report on E-Cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking stemmed from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "basic report" last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the data’s resilience and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the “extremely windy basis” on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked if the claims “build on stone or sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said the public expects that PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision-making analysis (MCDA) to co-create their opinions on the harms of different nicotine-containing products.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director is said to have previously received British American Tobacco Funds (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was expected to receive from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not provided, but this includes several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also indicate an industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco management of PHE.
The group’s research work “significantly acknowledges” that there is a lack of “hard evidence for the damage to most products on most criteria,” wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE’s claims that “there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers” were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ’s claims had already been responded before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Every second smoker dies of his addiction for a lifetime.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to this, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the National Health System <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion per year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfill our national responsibility.
BBC to give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, saying that commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard-hitting timeframes against their rivals’ most popular shows and from broadcasters like BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had been unsuccessful in trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years during his time at Channel 4.
“I have problems with the idea that the BBC is commissioning or sending programs that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidized rivals,” Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the radio fee, which I don’t think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least give its production to programs that others don’t do or commission.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to reach as broad a support as possible for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is of course nonsense.
Johnson said, “I don’t see why a regressive tax program could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm to it.
I'm trying to see what this public-law television should be like.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series that ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC's fault in the hunt for ratings was "because of the ambitions of the people working there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts reflect what Sky's former head, Tony Ball, suggested in his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh that BBC shows like EastEnders should sell.
Johnson said that the rather public-law niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they do fulfill their tasks, and they can argue if they went on their seemingly sacred missions to justify <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion of broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we didn't have to go to the program if we didn't see any of this.
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the radio fee, Johnson told the committee, "I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value out of this.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a great value here for <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year, but for people who are for <0xC2><0xA3>150 a lot of money, ask me if that’s right, because they don’t consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also spoke before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education – he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on radio – and she should take herself to public-law television stations in Australia and Canada as an example of this change in “informing, clarifying and entertaining”.
When asked about the partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the proms, of which he said only a handful are shown on television, and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
‘Sonogenetics’ can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on Motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Further on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new process called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart, and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the one-day procedure could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses to people’s brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did so when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a Nature Communications report.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it uses ultrasound on the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microblades and transferred to the worms where they turn on the modified motor neurons.
The method has some similarities with optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down to the desired location in the brain at an optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right in front of your door!
The ads shame Britain's arms trade
View Amnesty International Anti-Weapon Fair Video.
Horrible killer drones!
Foot joint decomposing leg joints!
A cluster bomb!
And electric shock rods that cause painful pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest arms fair is a fighting parody produced by Amnesty International to bring the British government’s willingness to ramp up weapons to repressive regimes over the Defence and Security in the International Equipment Centre.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and subway trains and that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive with the DLR from September 15th to 18th?" (Docklands Light Railway) read in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which transforms into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will ride with the DLR ... customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a <0xC2><0xA3>6 pack of bus keys that are claimed to "get access to about a third of the bus stop ad space on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists engage with activists within protest movements at work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms trading placards greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding the advertising for the gun fair – through an ExCeL calendar dump – and thought, “We’re giving them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the invention of a more realistic ambiguous company advertisement, but "by inbreeding with bright colors and animation it remains more lenient."
“They’ve done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair,” said Amnesty’s Tom Davies.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and a guarantee that torture equipment will not be traded illegally outside our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors crave fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the U.S. Army over "the AT4CS RS shot from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding after-effects within the target."

Eight golden rules for living in student residences
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved into a student residence, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I have angered—and the numerous, long-standing complaints about others.
Most of what I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entrance to student residences ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening.
It’s tempting to black out: People tell you where you come from, if and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you “honestly don’t love or hate Marmite because seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract HAHA, I’m in my room.”
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you find out the people you like, unlike those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those fire extinguishers were on fire.
Leave people.
People’s rooms often turn into beverage receptions, movie night venues, and municipal meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress up and straighten their underwear.
Related: Don’t Think About Starting a Relationship at the University
Introverts get rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a space-to-space boom culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I spent on interacting with you."
Try to feel when a commiton of sociability is exhausted – and send it a text instead of tapping.
Speaking of taping: Do it.
A guy in my student residences had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship closes by baking.
Since you start college at the height of the back-many, knocking on the doors of people to imagine themselves with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked something for you. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personally."
Providing homemade delicacies is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to have a conversation and may end up associating your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed clumps of flour, sugar, and fat cause people to fall asleep when they tap.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Of course, cloning chickens is a steal, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well?
Check this with the milk owner.
Chances are good that they say to serve themselves, even when they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that’s annoying, and you have my sympathy — but try to treat them more balanced than my roommate, who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
They should not make any noise that keeps people from sleeping or from working.
It’s not just about being a decent person, but that you are in the truest sense of the word among the people sitting in the glasshouse.
A girl on my hallway asked her neighbors if they had anything to do with making Drum & Bass a little quieter, because it was three o’clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for another two hours before she let her own music play, closed her door and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student residence?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be deeply embarrassing to hold a roommate for your future spouse, run to her, separate, and then have to see her every day, and maybe co-exist, as she brings all her mutual friends to herself?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to make some sense of your lower body.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unclosed room, the boundary between a Ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good strike is fun, but it only takes moments until it becomes a boomerang.
Give a valuable and amusing lesson about safety by hiding - but never smother anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close their door, and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but do not lock their holdings on the ceiling more than twice.
Row houses for refugees, single-parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds row houses in the Middle Frankish Eckental for people who do not have a lot of money.
For example, for refugees – but also as a signal: “Not only refugees need living space, but also the single mother and the low-income.”
“I’ll show you how to still build cheaply and well today,” the 44-year-old said in an interview.
Thousands of refugees will be forced into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how to quickly create affordable living space: he is building row houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pushing the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here for a big part.
In view of the refugee flow, we also need enough living space in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when you put people in blocks of living.
Each of the six houses that are being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it is peace again, I am going back.
Then the houses can be easily converted according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184,000 euros, without land.
That's supervisable.
The construction took six months.
That's appropriate.
Did the construction regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: In terms of construction law, I have successfully completed my project.
It always makes the threatening Damocles sword special construction and the parking regulation particularly complicated.
That's terrible.
It is still assumed that those who create three apartments in a row house need at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities is there a place for it.
And refugees and asylum-seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their row house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don’t you intensify the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: True, we have had a building boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that can hardly afford one more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-income.
I'll show you how to build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem engineering in Regensburg and initially engaged in environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tap "General", and then select "Software Update".
When ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation, as they receive an error message that says the "software update has failed".
To address the issue, users are advised to either wait for the storm to recede or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made this more unlikely by squeezing the update. Also, it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger, so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple won’t allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off halfway and this could lead to a shutdown of the update.

You should also make sure that before you download, you have reviewed our checklist of all things to prevent things from running wrong and protect yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as tweaking the operating system.
Rosberg's only currency: full attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
Before the start, the World Cup runner-up stressed in the crucial seven overseas races, "that I have nothing left to lose".
53 points separate the vice world champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from defending champion and two-time champion Hamilton.
The Brit has already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and also takes the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Brite was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will affect the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has been to the spa more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is a member of the Bundesverdienskreuz 1st class and an honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and L<0xC3><0xBC>bbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen was supported by Gauselmann with a donation received by Chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to include chess players who are unable to make the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent-seeking should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>" will be seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
Quartiersb<0xC3><0xBC>ro seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Antonistift Altenzentrum joined forces under the mantle of the Social Foundation and a new meeting point opened at Graf-Staffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take courses there.
The Social Foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city center.
More specifically at Graf-Staffenberg-Platz.
A new neighborhood office has recently been opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, you will immediately receive seniors and advice-seeking information on issues such as health insurance or health and care insurance benefits.
For years, we have been finding with our outpatient care service that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
“Even so, many of the cash benefits are not often taken into account because the complexity of the insurances is hardly yet understood,” explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonystift and the B<0xC3><0xBC>rgerspital as well as for the outpatient service “Amadeus” as a department manager.
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this, the saludis were taken into the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or a physiotherapy treatment.
The offers from the Senior Centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, precaution and reha.
"The Senior Care and Care Centre," said Heike Riedel, CEO of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new headquarters office in the city centre is that both managing directors see particular demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, according to Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) at the inauguration celebrations, the Quarter Office also dedicates itself to the association in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering".
As a result, the Social Foundation made a major contribution to ensuring that seniors can live independently and well in their familiar environment.
The Quartiersb<0xC3><0xBC>ro is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg against W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it’s official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburger Kickers was not yet set due to renovation work at Fuchsparkstadion, October 6 was now set as the date.
The encounter of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian Football Totopokal against the third-leger FC W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburger Kickers has now been finalized.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 7 p.m. at Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
“We’re happy that we now know when the game is over, now we have planning security,” says FCE team manager Karlheinz H<0xC3><0xBC>mmer, who also points to the now-launched pre-sale of cards.
It’s special for our team to play against a third-party leaguer.
We therefore hope for many spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games do have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg went on to win the district league 1st FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league 1st FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5000 and qualifies for the first round of the 2016/2017 DFB Association Cup.
The defending champion is third-leg forward SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna Architect Karl Mang Dies at 92
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the artist’s house reported on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treasure Chamber in the Wiener Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Lobkowitz Palace in the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Park punishment: Tim Wiese sues policeman with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has been unwittingly spotted in Bremen.
Footballer was once, meanwhile Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, is a wrestler.
According to his own statement, he has added 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the last two years.
Intellectually, however, he did not.
Wiese had his hair cut right in the centre of Bremen when he saw a parking guard exhibiting a criminal record for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
Wiese then stormed out of the store, insulted the official, and threw the penniless fine at her feet, as the "picture" newspaper reports.
In the city of Bremen, the allegations are confirmed, but the consequences of the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The matter is still under review," says the city of Bremen.
Only after that will it be decided whether or not the meadow is displayed.
Panama's government destroys 4,500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the typical rainforest climate of the Isla del Rey are best suited for the flourishing of marijuana plants.
For the past three days, the Panamanian authorities have been tearing out the 4,500 plants and burning them.
Afghans beat 17-year-old man
Witnesses are searching for an incident in Bad Soden-Salm<0xC3><0xBC>nster: On Friday evening, around 11:45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salm<0xC3><0xBC>nster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and told them to wait for him.
At that time the group was at the level of the bft gas station.
There were also three people standing on the site of the gas station.
One of these men then shouted at the young man and slapped him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a broken nose and was bleeding heavily from the nose.
When his two friends rushed out and rushed to the beater, he first let go of his sacrifice.
From his friends, the injured young man was now brought home.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and went through it demonstrably several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the butcher and another male person.
With the help of a baton, the victim’s face and thighs were pierced.
The injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrators.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second batter was said to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed in a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and whistleblowers to report on the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank M<0xC3><0xBC>ller takes over Felstehausen practice and invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>310000
Silvia M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Gogoll and Frank M<0xC3><0xBC>ller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Mayor Bernd Bormann, business manager Uta Seim-Schwartz and mayor of Asendorf Heinfried Kabbert are also pleased about this.
In many places in the country doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: there Dr. Frank M<0xC3><0xBC>ller takes over the Felstehausen practice on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still with his successor in the next few months with half a place.
After a conversion phase, M<0xC3><0xBC>ller reopens the practice on October 12, until then he invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>310000 in the premises on St. Marcellusstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met years ago Frank M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and his wife Dr. Silvia M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Gogoll, who is currently completing their specialist training at Verdener Hospital and wants to start practicing next year as well.
"We always had in mind that the M<0xC3><0xBC>llers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was that far, I just called her."
The couple M<0xC3><0xBC>ller liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
“The closeness and constant contact with patients is very attractive to us,” says M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, 39.
"We want to get to know and accompany families over the years."
As an advantage, he also soon sees himself as his own boss.
And so they agreed, the M<0xC3><0xBC>llers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
Frank M<0xC3><0xBC>ller’s two-time family father also grew up there, and his medical studies in Hannover followed him to several medical practices as well as hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a GP in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior notary in the district of Diepholz and is engaged on a voluntary basis in the DRK-Bereitschaft Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From September 19th, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a house doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The M<0xC3><0xBC>llers, both internists, want to settle down as GPs.
“The endoscopy is therefore coming out,” says 38-year-old Silvia M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Gogoll.
After the conversion, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and load ECGs and need a more voice room.
In addition, the EDV will be completely renewed.
The M<0xC3><0xBC>llers receive a grant of a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000 as part of a funding programme from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12500) and the municipality (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12500).
“This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue,” says Bernd Bormann, mayor of Samtgemeinde.
According to Silvia M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Gogoll, about 2000 patients come to Felstehausen every quarter, while the average practice in northern Germany is around 500.
In Asendorf there is another house doctor practice.
A positive side effect of the practical acquisition by Frank M<0xC3><0xBC>ller: The pharmacy remains in Asendorf, according to Ursel Felstehausen.
If she had not found a successor, she would have gone.
By the way, those who attend M<0xC3><0xBC>ller’s speaking class continue to look above all in familiar faces: the seven medical professionals take over and the cleaning force from the rock houses.
Their farewell ends an era in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen recalls smiling.
They feel a little bit of pain after a long time.
“But we are still living in Hohenmoor and many patients will surely still be seen,” says the internist.
Her husband adds with a laugh: "We have a 6000 square meter basepiece."
“So far I’ve always pressed myself before gardening, now it could be different.”
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now the border controls will also be carried up to our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
Controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It remains clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also do this “of course”.
The safety and security of people is paramount.
However, it is also clear that “signals are needed,” the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also like to allow refugees arriving in Austria and Germany to continue their journey and may also be building corridors for refugees.
However, Interior Minister Vesna Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rk<0xC3><0xB6>s Znidar did not see this in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will instead intensify the border surveillance - especially to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, however, Slovenin does not want to block its borders for refugees.
“Every EU member must fulfil his or her obligations, otherwise the system cannot function,” Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rk<0xC3><0xB6>s Znidar stressed.
As the Croatian government said, the first refugees had already tried to enter eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in the night hours to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to seize them in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, since then, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly meeting in the Croatian Tovarnik.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country expects around 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday in a consistent manner.
The government in Belgrade, however, disputes that it is to instruct people to strike certain routes: "We cannot, nor do we want to do this," it said.
According to media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees had arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the early hours of the day, and more buses would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometers away.
"We have heard that Hungary has invaded, so the police have told us that we should go here," one of the refugees said.
They wanted to continue traveling to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
In this way, it could actually lead to the shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly further west.
Croatia: "Extensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia’s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible emergency situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member has "comprehensive possibilities for border control".
Strict checks are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member of this group since 2007, and the EU partners have consistently provided a good testimony to the country in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, around 300 refugees remain trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrader media reports, they had spent the night at the border crossing Horgos, which leads to R<0xC3><0xB6>szke.
According to Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic was still trying to calm down at a local sighting in Horgos on Wednesday morning: he is holding the debate on alternative routes for refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment.
One cannot say yet whether they would continue their journey across Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants to - dangerous - Alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute to the refugees maps, on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area there are still unexplored minefields 20 years after the end of the Croatian War.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of miners had been sent to the border region.
Stockbroker: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals who have been accused of repeatedly gaining insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
With the acquired information, insider deals are said to have been made in the financial markets.
According to the investigators, a total of more than $100 million was recovered.
“Today’s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will eventually be caught,” the SEC said in a statement.
The trials against 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted both in the United States and from Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospizilfe Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz, there is a rainy operation.
People do their worries, some quick steps, some cozy buzzing.
You control the two stations of the Mannheim Autosalon at the Paradeplatz.
Keep city rails.
Heartwarming, glorious life in the midst of the beautiful autumn sunshine and four large tables each with the title "Before I Die I Want to Die"....
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospice helped to draw attention to its 20-year existence and is quite confronted with mixed reactions.
“It’s about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people,” says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospital is available to the passer-by for questions and conversations as well as the volunteers.
While some of the passersby spontaneously grabs the chalk and adds the phrase "behave my life", "can read", "with the camper driving through the United States", "stop the war" or "don't suffer long", others stay short, read, say phrases like "as far as I'm not yet" and then go on.
Again and again, small discussions develop on the edge about the action itself, about life, dealing with death.
Peter H<0xC3><0xBC>binger is also present.
“Only when I realize that the end will come to this world for me at some point can I live responsibly,” says the director of the Diaconic Works Mannheim, who together with the Caritas Association is the bearer of the Ecumenical Hospice.
Therefore, this effective public action for the 20-year-old is good.
However, the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards is understandable, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The theme of death and death is still stuck with taboo, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the Hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening of people.
A review shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The Death and Grief Companion is one of the first-hour volunteers.
Faced with personal experience with the subject, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the death penalty.
When the Ecumenical Hospital was looking for volunteers by call, she immediately registered and was involved in the establishment in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospice of St. Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can cope well with her task and the experiences and experiences she has made.
“I see life from another wait, think it’s precious and appreciate the moment,” she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical Hospice Service is free of charge and independent of confession.
The financial support of the health insurance and donations of relatives and associations enables the training as well as training and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tables described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Further personal wishes can also be noted on postcards.
FedEx Results Mixed, Financial Outlooks Lowered for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook to a full year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
Shares fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to make a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook comes despite price increases, which are on average 4.9 percent and will become effective on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages to be picked up from November.
The company said it still expects the result to increase compared to the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and due to growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "is delivering solid returns considering the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for the holiday employment were announced a day later than those of the rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6% more than in the previous year.
The earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share predicted by twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zack expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipments in recent years, which has stagnated sales in its Express shipment unit.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in ground transportation increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx stocks dropped by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting of the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahogany table to decide if it’s time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
Threatening over them at one end of the ornate, two-storey sitting room is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation’s economic interests above all else.
The central bank has a two-fold mandate from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it, and it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to take off from the unprecedented stimulus by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most data from the economy show that it is growing solid, the recent turbulence in global financial markets could cause the already cautious Fed representatives to worry about increasing this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds – and even by just a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing they see,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is justifiable enough to keep waiting,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself insures the financial market.
About half of the economists polled recently by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
The financial markets, however, expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed’s policy will maintain the set this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise the rates at that point,” he said.
If she does, “she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don’t panic.”
Other experts argued that an increase in interest rates would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Even a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in spring and spring that this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected an increase in the rate.
Although the creation of jobs slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed sees as full employment.
Salary increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was consistently below the central bank’s 2% annual target, Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy “can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the strain on the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world rallied at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
In May, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 16% below its peak, as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would shake global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the May high.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation when to increase interest rates.
“If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy hadn’t occurred in the past few weeks, they would be pulling the strings in this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US-Notenban.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to get the effects better at hand.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts will be on the U.S. economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the currency authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “need” its monetary expansion sparked confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc’s global asset management strategy.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundamentals data."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is committed to raising interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions “despite limited discernible impacts on U.S. growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed’s representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate fixing committee.
Recent turbulences do not come close to this level, he said.
“She certainly doesn’t want to get into a situation where she’s afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are excited,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don’t think it should be ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/camp is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need engine oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the aisles.
If the whole grocery store makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The garage kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this shop is close to the cash registers and has various take-out options.
What is there: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat shop is extensive, as is the fish shop - the staff behind the counter will clean and fill the fish and even fry on request for you.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galant, whole ducks, fish, beef and bile, pork natural gut, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, even individual families and individuals.
The wide aisles are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find: fresh Monthong Durian next to the box.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the shop is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
To give them a warm welcome, does not go without the commitment of countless volunteer helpers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unselfish asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She also likes to teach with her 74 lenses.
She does it every Thursday at the asylum seeker’s home on Dillinger Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is a completely different lesson than at a proper school.
Brazil's Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to shockingly explain to women how important good nutrition is during breastfeeding. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher calorie intake isn’t the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipality of Bernried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar installations.
The plans for the long-awaited gymnasium construction at Bernrieder Sportgel<0xC3><0xA4>nde are progressing step by step: In the recent municipal meeting, the elaborate building proposal was unanimously sealed without much discussion.
Previously, the board had decided, among other things, to apply for a statutory "exception" or "exemption" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" was about the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "satellite roof with non-medium first and roof overhang" is to be built.
Against the background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "This brings together a wonderfully large south roof", said Mayor Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
The "liberation" was again about the inclination of the roof, which is to be below ten degrees for energetic reasons - other than those prescribed in the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is thereby significantly reduced.
A "liberation" was therefore necessary, because the building plan does not allow "exceptions" regarding the refusal of the roof - with the Bernrieder municipality council generally proceeding more restrictively in the case of liberation applications.
However, this is not a recurring project in Turnhallenbau: "We are not creating a precedent with this," says Steigenberger.
Turnhallenbau at Sportzentrum is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
About 2.3 million euros are included in the cost.
Grants are expected from the school and sports promotion.
In the next step of the procedure, the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall is now submitted to the Land Council Office for examination.
Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg clinic moves to Schongau
The Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new Medical Director at Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of employees move from Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg to Schongau.
This is according to the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the district, confirmed by the Landr<0xC3><0xA4>tin Andrea Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>.
However, a decision on this will be taken by the Supervisory Board, which will meet on Wednesday, 23 September.
Should the plans be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg would be further employed.
The vast majority were to move to Schongau with Fischer and the still existing Inner Station.
The rooms are available.
Employees who cannot travel to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>.
Staff should be informed about the plans.
The change was triggered by the dismissal of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been Medical Director of the Schongau Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
On the question of who will succeed, according to Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>, the name "Fischer" came into play, which declared itself ready to take over the management from October 1 and move with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "upgrade" and an extension of the offer in the area of "Internal medicine", according to Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>.
Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the indoor station.
As a transition for the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board approves it, will lead both houses, until next year the former hospital of Knappschaft, which still has more than 35 beds, will be permanently closed in Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018 when the current renovation at the Weilheim hospital is completed.
Landr<0xC3><0xA4>tin Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F>, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, has come across rumors that the house, which is owned by the Federal Government, will be used as a shelter for asylum seekers in the future.
As the real estate continues, Jochner-Wei<0xC3><0x9F> could not say that there are several considerations.
Currently, there are a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatry.
“What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come again,” Fischer said of the quasi move to the Lech, which had been taken by the employees “positively and very understandingly.”
A real perspective for the house, where Fisher has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years, has not existed.
He was asked by Schongau colleagues to take over the post of Medical Director.
The Pei<0xC3><0x9F>enberg Hospital (one hundred beds) has been threatened with closure over the past decades, departments have been closed, for example, surgery and birth care.
The handballers of the Rhein-Neckar Lions are required tonight (20.15 pm) at the Bergisches HC.
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for the superiority.
Last season, the Badeners suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have enjoyed something there.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
During their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon, two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunshots.
During the evening at a cornfield near Pratau (Wittenberg County), several hunters were in use, as police reported.
After a shooting, a 63-year-old and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly it came to the accident was initially unclear.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate Victims of Crimes of Violence
A suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-year-old missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the teenagers and throwing their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old man from Rhineland-Palatinate, who has been missing since Saturday, has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, according to prosecutors and police on Wednesday.
The suspect is also a 20-year-old man who was arrested on Tuesday night, who was charged with the crime and led investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after coming home the previous evening after a visit to an autumn party in Rockenhausen not as agreed.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first encountered personal items of the victim.
In interviews in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing, a suspicion of fact turned out against the 20-year-old.
The alleged perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen where the body was found.
According to the police, the detainee admitted to killing the 16-year-old and putting the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was due to be presented on Wednesday to the detainee, who is being charged by investigators.
Further investigations are to be carried out on the details of the facts.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns of housing shortages
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for affordable accommodation.
The pressure on the housing market is increasing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles in the German housing market have long begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would need to be built every year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the association "Social Housing".
For comparison: 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
There are 140,000 homes missing.
Refugees are no longer required after the first three months of their stay to live as asylum seekers in a first-time accommodation.
Many then enter the housing market and enter the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers were hired last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also accounts for significant failures in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is facing a housing deficit, which is increasing year after year.
Currently, around 770,000 housing units were already missing in the urban areas, complains Matthias G<0xC3><0xBC>nther, author of the study.
Therefore, many professionals were forced to live in large cities in WG-rooms.
Young adults remained unwittingly longer in the "Hotel Mama" due to the flute in the housing market.
In large cities, the number of square meters per head has declined for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing" proposes a restart.
In doing so, new incentives are to re-curve social housing construction.
In this way, the basic income tax could be waived and the basic income tax for subsidized housing could be suspended for a period of time.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax write-off options are needed.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation of Staatsbank KfW is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the available <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million had already been collected on Monday evening with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>184 million.
Now the project could even be stepped up.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridors
After Hungary, there is practically no breakthrough, as more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow the crossing over Slovenia to the north without any obstacles.
The route is dangerous, though.
Croatia wants to reach agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke with the Slovenian interior minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the shelling of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia in order to reach Western Europe from there.
500 people have crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary had closed its border for refugees the day before.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically unnecessary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this possibility."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
Croatian police seized the first refugees on the Serbian border to the EU-neighbor country of Croatia in the morning.
Most of the media reports came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to get to Croatia on foot across the green border.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, however, the refugees do not encounter border fences.
For this, the border strip carries other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Miners should now quickly create a safe passage.
However, after the closure of the border, there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police numbered 366 people.
Shortly before closing on Monday, there were still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws include the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a crime.
Therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern border town of Szeged.
The convicts face up to five years in prison and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of them - 93 - the most important crossing R<0xC3><0xB6>szke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with young children as well as two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 more refugees had stopped there.
Practically, however, no one has any more prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary.
In Hungary’s view, Serbia is a “safe third country”.
The rejected asylum-seekers are to be deported there.
Before the "transit zone" in R<0xC3><0xB6>szke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In R<0xC3><0xB6>szke, workers began to clean up with it.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the side of the road in recent weeks.
Locking gratings were dismantled and one of the receiving camps in the border area was converted.
No one wanted to talk about the purpose of this conversion.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria only reaches a few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants remained in the country, according to government figures.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the direction of German authorities.
In Freilassing, small groups of refugees regularly met on foot.
Mayor drove "strands" across the border
“We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance to the tent,” said Wernstein Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted by train to Passau.
But because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow, it was over in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the beached passengers, along with two other helpers and their cars over the border to the nearby Passau.
Before we first tasted the unexpected guests, with jacuzzi and drinks.
We immediately said we'd take them to Passau by car.
“That was natural for us,” Stadler said in the O<0xC3><0x96>N conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man could not afford to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
“We were very pleased with that,” Stadler said.
The stranded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening in Wels, in order to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that rail traffic was stopped to Germany.
However, the regional train was stopped outside the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border crossing is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday, days earlier a two-bridge race sportingly - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is now sending us thousands of more zigzags is a logical result of a seemingly sacred policy:
Instead of immediately helping to build structures in R<0xC3><0xB6>szke camp that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly put the Hungarian government’s position in the dark circles of National Socialism.
The suffering of this policy is not only those Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to find that the “promised country” they have invited and welcomed is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the ongoing refugee flows and the coming winter, to create humane conditions for those seeking protection.
And there will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter quarters
Konrad has all hands to do with the refugee intervention.
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up neighborhoods for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in Traiskirchen’s first recording centre has already caught Konrad.
“We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen,” he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was also carried out without large vortexes, Konrad said, praising the "master performance" of the organisation.
The interior ministry, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 squares this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodation will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 will be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without soil," Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the heads of state.
These would have assured him that he would also create neighborhoods for the coming refugees.
“It’s going well in Upper Austria,” said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-mandater supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch<0xC3><0xB6>nborn, with the aim of clarifying how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts great expectations into the ORF-action "Help like us".
On the platform, private individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
There is also hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it may not be that neighborhood providers need to maintain a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the headlights.
“Emergency standards” should apply for a limited period of time.
The fact that, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful in accommodation, Konrad explains with his experience.
I am an older gentleman, whose face is not without further ado the untruth.
Convincing power is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cost the Republic, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number to three to four.
So far, my own neighborhood search has not been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container on Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are obviously problems with the approval.
Linz calls for a better division
First of all, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planned by the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, as it is currently possible to accommodate those affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, in case of an emergency, further sites should be checked for their suitability.
Criticism is exercised by the mayor on the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also make their contribution here.
Seehofer: "Limits will not be closed down"
In a longer phone call with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), the head of state Josef P<0xC3><0xBC>hringer (VP) on Monday agreed on the further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders would not be sealed off.
The return of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the first time.
However, the asylum seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
From the other EU Member States, P<0xC3><0xBC>hringer once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue.
Austria’s reintroducing controls at its borders is “a logical consequence” for P<0xC3><0xBC>hringer from the Germans’ actions.
The next runtastic is a question of time
The general refurbishment of the "New Shipyard" in the Linzer Industrial Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T is pulled in, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
“In IT, the smart heads are our raw material – and we have to try to make them work for us,” says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the Neue Werft and later also acquiring those.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next runtastic is only a matter of time".
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 million was invested by S&T in the location, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.3 million by the Techcenter, which is one-third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany (FFG).
The building has been leased from Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the remaining 2,700 square meters in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni owner opens second store in the arcade
In the new shop, Furla handbags are the focus.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to adopt a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to postpone this project in the pigeon market arcade for a short time: after all, she has now gained growth in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla-Shop versus the store, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing of various manufacturers, now it is all about women's handbags of the brand Furla, wallets are to have from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
It was previously rebuilt several weeks ago.
“But I’ve been thinking for a long time about whether I should open another store,” Breit says.
The decisive factor in the decision was, among other things, that the furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were also affected by the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
“We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand,” says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots themselves.
Her fashion interest has been put wide by her mother into the cradle.
I am most impressed when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some women get into trouble when looking at a beautiful handbag, even the expert woman can not answer with the last certainty.
Maybe it’s because a nice bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
Donald Trump’s Palatinate ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are referred to as the Ancestors.
This trait also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become the U.S. president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for bullies.
Whether he is speaking out against foreigners, journalists being rude or revealing gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy – the candidate for the U.S. presidential office is vigorously mobilizing the election campaign.
And cut it well.
This is also registered in the Pfalzian city of Callstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire originate.
The New Yorker with the hairstyle is a term for many in the wine village on the wine road.
Some in the 1200-people-place is over -thirty corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the palace: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Kallstadter Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
“I think they find this kind of exciting, but they’re not so deeply impressed in their call city style either,” says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstadter has filmed an amusing documentary about the place and its famous storylines, among which Trump also includes the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for his modesty, is also mentioned in “Kings of Kallstadt” (2014) – so with the statement that he would surely also be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the king of hearts.
While there is respect for the family’s performance, there is also a tendency to think that Trump is “already a bit of a big mouth,” says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname that the city of call has in the vicinity was "Die Brulljesmacher" - in High German: the Angeber, she says.
Trump comes from the village of the informants.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when his grandfather emigrated to the United States and opened a site for gold diggers.
The foundation stone of the real estate group was the first real estate purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: their desire to return home permanently failed at the Bavarian state to which the palace belonged at the time.
He did not take Trump because he had once been removed without permission, the director of the Institute of Palatinate History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film's start.
Trump is the grandson of an “illegal immigrant.”
This contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the offspring.
He had repeatedly spoken out loud about Mexican immigrants to the U.S. and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
“Just like the poltergeist, that’s not so sympathetic,” says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trumps (“The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandfather was a born Heinz”).
The retired winemaker sees the American more distant, “he’s always so uplifting.”
Do you think Trump will come?
“I can’t imagine that,” says the 72-year-old.
"He never took care of Kallstadt".
The pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadter, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which generally arrived well.
“I can’t imagine that from Donald,” says the 68-year-old.
She would find it better if he didn’t win the election because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good.”
If those who had been saying at the time of his grandfather in the United States were like him, "wouldn't he have never been there."
“There are more interesting topics than him,” says winemaker’s daughter Sarah B<0xC3><0xBC>hler.
And as president?
“It’s not my president,” she says.
And: “The grapes will ripen even without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 moviegoers, even in the United States, arouse interest.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain village".
From the hand of the Vice President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-resident village in the Berchtesgaden National Park on Wednesday received the award for gentle tourism.
There are already 20 "mountain villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings despite Nine's attempts to take over the leadership loss at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report the loss of leadership of the Liberals, but it has not caused major shifts in the ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital, when Malcolm Turnbull managed to bring down Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was set in London as part of a one-week series of international television shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but his number stayed behind from last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise’s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers, up from 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the review!
Written by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
The big news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered this with a clear "yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 spectators – enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire’s Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, The Chase Australia’s first half-hour reached 520,000 viewers and was 720,000 in the second half.
The average hot seat is 620,000.
The decline in The Chase Australia’s second-evening odds will make Nine confident that Hot Seat will eventually take over at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to overwhelm the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man – but who will he choose?
Revealed a secret?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who won The Bachelor.
The woman, with whom Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor, was in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly be awarded if she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before becoming three out of two, you may have accidentally given a hint as to who will be the winner.
Sam Wood will keep his lips sealed until the final on Thursday.
All three women have taken a lyrical look at why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as the reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should get Woods' last rose?", their answers could become the game spoiler who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as Wood's best partner.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
“From the moment I went into the house and [Sarah’s] and Sam’s energies noticed, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought about that throughout the show,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is standing with both feet on the ground, it’s so much fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood as a couple would be well-suited.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the house visit last week made it clear to her that Wood could be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now unconditionally set on him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood would choose, if not her, she was enigmatic.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a disagreement between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the U.S. – and there were many other teams that sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches had thrown Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a tie as did the Aussie Rugby League convert on his first point return on Tuesday in a 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a punt return and also into the running game after an injury from Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies in front of the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his fake catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne agrees with a point that was restored in the first quarter by the Minnesota Vikings
It certainly wasn’t the start Hayne and his massive Australian following for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the fumble and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career.
"That was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his original debut back in 2007 when a pass at his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested on a Siberian rolling field with gun violence.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos seized and his democratic efforts were thwarted.
Because of the high number of refugees, the Free Voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria.
Party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn conclave in Gro<0xC3><0x9F>wallstadt against a severe crisis at Bavarian schools, if there are no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers", to tell the schools Aiwa before the collapse.
"Otherwise, we will get disapproval in the Bavarian education system."
The Free Voter’s Landtag faction will meet in the Lower Franconian municipality until Friday.
Actually, quite different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overwhelm the clause," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN refugee protection zones in Syria, as it did during the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s.
“That’s not how it goes, we have to address the causes,” said the Free Voter Chief.
Rejected asylum-seekers want to postpone the Free Voters as soon as possible.
That’s why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum cases: “We also need at least 50 new asylum judges,” Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticized that several federal states are not consistent: "We need uniform standards of federal states across the federal state."
"Bayern pushes, others don't."
“We need to be more actionable.”
However, national politics in Gro<0xC3><0x9F>wallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-term burnout remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has launched the pilot test "Middle level plus" at 47 high schools, where an extension of the high school level is tested from three to four years - as a result, it will then take again nine years to graduate.
However, this does not go far enough.
"The G9 issue needs to be accelerated," the FW chief said.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.

4 people killed after police shot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr Dhakal said the police had used tear gas and then shot into the air before returning to rubber floors.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber floors used, which are known to kill, but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal’s southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus who wanted a separate state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since the 10th.
Killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been ruled centrally for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers have voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Building area in the city planned
The property at the Emder Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area.
A mix of trade, trade and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a 4,000-square-meter plot in direct proximity to the Alte Post Youth Centre.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of trade, trade and housing.
We are waiting for offers from the city, it is said.
It is not yet clear which investor is in question.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had bought part of the property, which is located on the Ringstra<0xC3><0x9F>e/Ecke Gro<0xC3><0x9F>e Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, a few months ago and let the buildings on it be demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for a holiday home on the Kleine Meer near Emden take shape.
For the first time, the investor presented public plans for the project.
Several investors are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure resort
For months, behind closed doors had been negotiated, scribbled, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home on the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized enterprise "System-Building", presented his plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Emder Council.
This item had originally been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP faction, which accuse the investor and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the system-building business management went into the offensive: "We still do not have an answer to all the questions," he told the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to face all rumors now.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12 million project has been under discussion for months.
Violent reactions among mermaid owners, who had come to the meeting, called out the pictures and new details for the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the seabed and member of the board of directors at the interest of the investors, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant cloister that will surpass all other buildings".
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase greatly due to the intended size of the plant: "There must be whole bus loads to make this count," Schulz said.
What exactly happens on the roughly one hectare-sized area of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
There is no operator yet.
“First we need to have a final concept,” Ralf Behrends said.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans are still variable.
Twins growing up at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is pleased to welcome young people to its Gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years old and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet fixed, as Mother Dian has kept them close to the body so far.
At first, the “picture” was reported.
NHC Predicts 60 Percent Chance of Cyclone South of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday a broad deep-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verdean islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical storm in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined deep-pressure system, for example, in the middle between the Cape Verdean Islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical storm over the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google Launches Duplication Donation Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a doubling-donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have rolled over European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
“Our journey included many dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $11 million on Google.com/refugee Relief.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
“The mortality data take a long time to show something,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote a lead article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss operations or adiposity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgeries to treat type 2 diabetes have proven to be effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill-fated with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected since 2007 in a study comparing two types of adiposity surgery – gastric bypass and gastric tube formation – to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained approximately the same for those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% completely resolved the diabetes disease and 28% in part.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes completely resolved at only one percent and in part at only about two percent.
In addition, the results on blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol were “generally better in the ‘surgical’ group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7%, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average haemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" — as reflected in the improved haemoglobin A1c level — did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass Surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1 % vs. 2.1%), and had a greater overall increase in haemoglobin A1c (3.1 % vs. 16.9 %) compared to the gastrectomy group.
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent an adiposity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years – compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any benefit for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was calming for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the critical point of this study because it says this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group,” she said, without increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think once you’ve collected these genetic changes that your body has firmly linked to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard.”
Love story plays in the Hunsr<0xC3><0xBC>ck
It is a topic that is currently gaining more attention in the fine arts: A young woman, unpopular and unsympathetic at school, meets the swarm of her youth after years, and he falls in love with her.
So also in the recently published novel "Actually we are not like this" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel should be especially interesting for Hunsr<0xC3><0xBC>cker readers, as it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to put a literary monument to her hometown.
"It's impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugee homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that under the given circumstances, the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, but the situation is not appropriate.
“It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany’s and Austria’s efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“To care for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long-term solutions, how a real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries,” he said.
Finally, we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
“The use of violence has never solved these problems,” he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attack and highlighted that the violent US response drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the use of hand sanitizers by children in the last 4 years
U.S. poison control centers report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who ingest highly alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand sanitizer intakes in children under 12 who report poison control centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them are going into the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children intentionally drink disinfectants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Young people have reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcohol-containing mouth water to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for it,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange fragrance that are very appealing for children.
Hand sanitizers contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, few sprayers can lead to alcohol poisoning.
“It’s highly concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison call center at the University of Kansas Hospital, the Fox 4 transmitter in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn’t let a sip of whisky stand around, but people leave these hand sanitizers in the reach of children, and if children come to it, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four syringes of hand sanitizer that smelled like strawberry in school, was taken into an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice as high as the threshold considered legally drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah sneered at her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl fell through the alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
“It was very scary,” said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and store hand sanitizers outside the child’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizers that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in the state of New York planned to poison their “common” teacher by laying out antibacterial products around the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizers and banned them from her room.
The police considered the deplorable plan a "discussion" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a car accident on the Querspanga between Nordring and Auf Herden.
A 60-year-old truck driver was driving on the Querspange in the direction of the circular traffic industrial area and realized too late that two forward vehicles had stopped at the circular traffic.
As a result, he shoved his truck into the back of an Audi and pushed it onto a Ford Fiesta standing in front of it.
The vehicles involved in the accident were subject to damage of around 10,000 euros, police said.
The 33-year-old’s Audi was no longer ready to go and had to be taken off.

Griffiths plays down talk about disharmony
There are rumours of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don’t think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores the Netherlands - de Boer
The former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show highlights of the Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what interests them.
There’s a lot of tension in the old company games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malm<0xC3><0xB6> and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen followed, who are now clearly at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll be back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel that way, but we have to keep going.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Now to stand together is so important.
Warburton Careful with January Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new accesses and insists that he does not want to disturb the unity of the Ibrox cadre.
Brentford’s former chief executive said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal note
Swansea striker Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation, has indicated that he can withdraw if his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with an annoying ankle for two years and has not managed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA Battle for Neilson's Comments Cancelled
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the Defender's Red Card was later cancelled - Collum's third Red Card, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson stays with what he said and insists, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The unimproved Hibee was assigned after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place at a Roseburn area pub in Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the striker said, adding, "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle if it's not for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United-Management
Simon Donnelly insists that Dundee United’s board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around – but admits that the downturn must end on the pitch.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We will bring the boys back to Trab," Donnelly said.
McInnes was happy to "win badly" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team desperately had to fight Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league win that brought them a five-point lead ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's 11th in the first half.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues that have not even won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising overall in the United Kingdom.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter – a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Scotland Secretary of State David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
The drunks interfered with the process
As the security personnel were unable to satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
It was only with the use of pepper spray that the officials were able to alert the rioters.
A breath alcohol test resulted in a 16-year-old 0.89 promille.
The adult was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old man had 2.15 promilles and initially remained in custody.
Why I Will Be Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn’t, I’ll sit in a spectator gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the U.S., and since more applications are often available than places, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will watch it emotionlessly.
I can't do that.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip’s closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to bring a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the prisoner’s story as he wants it, and you get access.
I complain to her.
She admitted that she “could have formulated it better,” but she still thinks it’s wrong what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write.
When he dies, he thinks that the public work of the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I do not want to go back to all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the deed.
But I think there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will see him die.
I can't say I'm really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man Convinced After Wet Police Persecution Hunt to Come From the Canning River
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a Perth man to hang the police was unsuccessful when he found himself in the shallow and swampy water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "simply persuade him to return to shore."
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for a house-break incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspects, he tried to escape them in the direction of Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to wet his uniform, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiated".
“Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape,” said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the trenches to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s Late Scratching due to a racing treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt-tupper test at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had abstained for 18 months because of the spying allegations and did not want it to “look like too high-hanging grapes.”
“I didn’t intend to say anything about it, and I’ve been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that everything comes out all at once,” Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to go around raised head, and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don’t do that, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Earlier, Moody had let the bomb go off in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man — whom I will name when I’m asked — and offered him a job in my stables to deliver information about what I’m doing inside my stables,” Moody said.
You seem to think I'm a fraud.
If that’s the case, they should definitely stick to their noses because they failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saudry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still today.
Is that supposed to make me think it's going to be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardlyly and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what’s going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think that I am.
Maybe they’ll have to take my license and break me, and I have no doubt that what I’m saying will make them think about it now.
But now I've come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The trainer’s frustration levels were built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say that he “could throw his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, called the racing days treatment rule "sad" after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
“It’s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
“One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday, whatever it was.
It was the same on race day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation into this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don’t know anything about the horse.
“We all see that we need rules, but here you have gone too far,” Moody said.
Man arrested after driver's flight
Police arrested a man on weekends after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver's flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver continued to drive without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia stood up to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with a driver’s flight and neglected assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital and is in a stable condition.
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy backs up against rivals over allegations of ring fights
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players' tackle as an "agenda setting" by two NRL Premier League favorites.
Sydney Rooster's coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the storm players "ring fights" with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled remark to the Storm team after his team scored the final win against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening. He called the game a "pattern example" of the Rugby League and said the two from Queensland were not "too good" in Rigen.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said they were only focused on their "contact" when tackled.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team confidently voiced him as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the storm team.
"It shows up again and again - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about ring fights when they beat us 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques all year round, but over the past six weeks, we’ve made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that’s been a trend shift for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he’s probably not used to losing it, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It’s funny how this happens again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "sad" football.
Wayne is talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he's going to take care of a piece of shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football – not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build up more confidence because they say these things because they’re a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters achieved a higher result than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven’t looked at it yet, but what was the result? 16:12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are pauses and no points something exciting?
For me, these are the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet them at some point.
The Storm team is free this weekend, as they have won the right to receive either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on Saturday evening in the AAMI Park pre-finals.
Serbia with $200,000 bail after drug charge
A man who may face a life-long punishment for his attempt to get possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released for a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and landed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his fellow defendants at the marina during the morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life-long punishment for trying to own a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there is no evidence that he was trying to own the entire amount and that the cafe might have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has a clear relationship with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maximovic’s mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 security deposit together to secure his release.
“After reading the affidavits of the two people, it is clear that the release of a $200,000 security is a real financial burden,” Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, on condition that he hand over his Australian and Serbian passport, report to the police on a daily basis, and stick to an exit lock from 18:00 to 06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: F<0xC3><0xBC>hrerhaus breaks apart
On Tuesday evening, a truck driver was seriously injured in an accident with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried unsuccessfully to turn left at the last moment, as police said.
The driver's cabin of the accident driver completely broke apart.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for more than six hours until 2 p.m.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone from girl to lure paedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl’s phone when he slept, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages, and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and looked at the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered “relevant” web searches that used terms for searching for indecent pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to “pedophiles on the Internet” and then “gave up being a police officer to scare her”.
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a scam - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: “When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was sitting and crying.
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the defendants with it.
The girl was interviewed and said the accused used the computer and playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to taking indecent pictures of children on 14 June last year, violating the conditions on 25 January of this year and not appearing before a court hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim asked for Hogg not to appear in the sexual offender register as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" can be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
Before the date of the judgment, he was included in the list of sexual offenders.
Locksmiths flee to small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken up off the German-Austrian border by large checkpoints.
Many locksmiths let people more and more at smaller border crossings out of fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side out, said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
More than 1,000 refugees have been arrested in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had arrived on the German side on foot over bridges and dams.
There, they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to the registration.
According to federal police reports, there were significantly more refugees at the Munich Central Station than at the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
By 8 a.m. alone, around 700 people had arrived in the country’s capital, a spokesman said this morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, on Tuesday 1759 refugees had reached the city.
Stuttgart: Tropensturm "Henry" in the southwest is expected
Meteorologists warn of storm surges in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart reported.
The mighty deep is the end of the "Henry" tropical storm, which has been pulled over the Atlantic by the Bermuda Islands in recent days.
Severe storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, even in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance with buoys from 60 to 90 km/h can be expected until Thursday morning.
On Friday, the sun can be seen for a longer time.
The mass is doing it: every two years the carmakers at the IAA show their news.
2015 is mainly to be noted movement in the compact cars, which currently sell particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in high demand: around 28.1 percent of new approvals fell on this segment in August alone, according to the German Federal Office for the Automotive Industry (KBA).
This is also reflected in the IAA (Public Days 17-27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars, many new compact models will be introduced this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be with the dealers in the autumn.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us,” Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the trade fair.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
For the volume model to sell well, the new Astra is also not to be much more expensive.
Opel is set to launch below VW Golf’s biggest competitor, which will start at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17,650.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra comes with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hesse offer additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only five-door.
As a second variant, the combination will follow in the spring, which can also be seen on the IAA.
Besides the Astra at the IAA, what are new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-doorer in a conventional and a sporty GT version.
It will be sold at the beginning of next year, then also as a truck.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is brand new in the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan Ableger wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment.
With its curved lines, the compact Infiniti fits fully into the brand’s design line.
The base model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
There is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbocharged engine with a power output of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to manufacturer data.
The sale of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n ranger placed their hands above all at the front: here the radiator grille was redesigned and the modified headlights are equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and Apple’s CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, the IAA in the compact class includes a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are unworthy of humans
The Federal Constitutional Court has acquitted an ex-prisoner of the Tegel law enforcement agency, who had been housed in a cell too small for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can hope for money even if they were locked in the rooms too tight for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
An ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was thus successful: he was housed in the Berlin-Tegel judicial district between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space; the toilet was spatially not separated.
After that, the man, who, according to his lawyer, was now again on a free footing, had been moved to a larger cell.
However, his official complaint about the unfair conditions of imprisonment against the country of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional Courts upheld the ruling of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re-examination there.
You see the man’s dignity violated.
Chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of imprisonment from the period in question were decisive for the compensation, there was a claim for compensation, it was said.
Otherwise, it would be "a coward of the legal protection of the personality to be feared".
The court must now clarify the amount of compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of conscience.
So they only spoke to a prisoner in April for damages because he was locked in a cell naked.
According to a 2011 decision, it is also unworthy to have a cell with no separate toilet.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 an unworthy accommodation.
The plaintiff at the time was housed daily for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case.
The Berlin prisons had also come to the headlines in recent weeks due to lack of personnel.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly detained for 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even at beatings it is said to have already come because of the tense situation.
According to the Justice Press Office, 21 places in Tegel are not occupied due to lack of young people, 19 are due to fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: “We’re doing it”
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What is happening in Germany?
Around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accommodate one million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say over and over again: We can make it, and we can make it".
What is happening in Germany gives the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built so far (250000 apartments).
However, the lack of living space is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rental properties: Every year, 60000 to 80,000 social apartments fall out of the rental price bond, and refugees will also apply for these particularly affordable apartments.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million euros to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the perspective of the Pestel Institute: 80,000 social housing must be created annually and for this the Federal Government should invest a funding of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, says Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thr<0xC3><0xA4>nhardt.
In Germany, according to Thr<0xC3><0xA4>nhardt, there has been a political shift: from the ban on work for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there used to be an employment ban for asylum-seekers up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residency requirement that asylum-seekers be restricted to a place of residence.
In society, also because of the lack of skilled workers, the majority of the view has been that refugees should be allowed access to the labour market more quickly.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of German knowledge.
To date, there is not yet a sufficient range of general and professional language courses.
Research also shows that workplaces are most often mediated by personal contacts.
The establishment of networks is therefore, in Thr<0xC3><0xA4>nhardt’s view, the King’s Road to Work Integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to the Kitas, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: “For the uprooted parents, it is very important to hold the family together,” says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
However, in order to convince the family of the advantages of the kita, the administration distributes hand-written notes in different languages.
Should the need for educators increase greatly due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity – for example, by allowing more vocational schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge in welcome classes are prepared for the lesson.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patients from studying - the only exception so far was Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his position.
Student-voluntary refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
Because refugees with a residence permit or a residence permit will no longer receive benefits under the asylum-seekers’ performance law when they start studying.
In principle, the latter do not get a buffalo, as they do not fall under the circle of the buffalo-eligible persons.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far to be eligible for Baf<0xC3><0xB6>g, from 1 January 2016 this span will be shortened to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, demands Steffen Krach, Berlin’s Secretary of State for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should immediately receive a Baf<0xC3><0xB6>g.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop the existing state-church law to a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic Welfare Association that takes care of the newcomers professionally.
The rights also include duties.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant it certain control.
This includes the willingness to take bold action against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to evict such conflicts in Germany "have immediately exercised their right to stay here, in Germany," he said on the Bavarian Radio.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more than it is today a topic of the whole society.
This will also mean that the majority of society will have to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more pressing.
Germany has had, as a result of European decisions, an anti-discrimination body and a general law on equality for almost a decade.
But it is very slowly learned, as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long called for and what international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention Germany are committed to must become a reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees, according to Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
“As far as manpower and capacities are concerned, we’re doing that,” he told the Daily Mirror.
However, for this, additional money has to flow into the system.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery asks all arrivals to hand out health cards immediately upon registration.
The services provided could be billed later with the federal states.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of benefits provided by the asylum-seekers’ law.
In other words, doctors tend to create language barriers.
Even so far, according to Berlin health scientist Thea Borde, migrants are being made worse aware of their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practice, interpreting costs have to be taken over, she demands.
Many refugees would have been helped, but also with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic view.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people it is about HIV education.
However, with the partly other images of the disease, German doctors came out of their training, according to Montgomery.
"Parasite seizure or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as for the medical shortage, there may even be relief in sight by the refugees.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, some refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be allowed to practice, they would need to prove their qualifications and possibly take exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates by the Federal Psychotherapists’ Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, says Dietrich Munz, president of BPtK.
A recent study published by the TU M<0xC3><0xBC>nchen shows that one in five Syrian refugee children is traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart rate and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe fright, and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply to social workers for psychotherapy, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social workers would usually decide whether a therapy is necessary or not, whether or not it is necessary to work with specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental illness.
This often leads to miscalculations, Munz says.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new staging "Passion", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to lure every age group into the ban on fascinating acrobatics, animal costumes and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you into the mane on the brick to dream.
“Our passion is the circus.”
“I can’t imagine living without my circus family,” says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior manager.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current mannequin staging.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift of enthusiasm is in the blood of the family.
“It’s important for us to get people out of their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours,” says the 27-year-old.
"Managen cocktail with Weltstadt-Flair", so director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometer tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with jokes and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of silent films, it wants to capture the Cuban duo loosely.
Lightness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art on the mast is designed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon ointments, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with fingertip feeling and joint.
Balance with the unicycle on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinated with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
“The animals belong to our family,” emphasizes Stephanie’s mother, Brigitte Probst.
Disadvantages in the attitude of circus animals are only too often the subject of various animal protection organizations.
Stephanie Probst added: “If our animals are not well, we are not well either.”
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each strike unit.
The "four-legged artist", as they are affectionately called, is read from the eyes as much as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel well, it does not want to go into the mange.
The most important thing is to take good care of the animals.
Especially on her zebroid jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland ponytail and a zebra stew, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together in a cage for eight years and nothing has happened.
“But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there,” says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the mange, but for this it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There should be something for every visitor.
“One thing is for sure,” says Stephanie Probst, “Whether it’s five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are with all our heart.”
The Circus Probst invites you every day from September 17th to 20th at 5pm and 8pm.
The program starts on Sunday at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, prices are reduced for the performance at 5 p.m.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe Speaks Wrong in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread across social media.
The opening of the parliament was also tarnished by allegations by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe’s appeal with bribes.
Last month, they had beaten him up and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones, which they warned of disrupting Mr. Mugabe’s address.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the concerned Members of Parliament that immunity in Parliament ends, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to the politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving efforts in the company’s services.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and service business operations.
The expected job cut will result in a burden of over $2.7 billion as of the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP’s chairman and chief executive, who is to lead the unit after the split.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and “will be focused on delivering unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for businesses,” the company said in a statement.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical plants and whose Palo Alto garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on the belief that closely focused companies deliver better performance.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can’t play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame about this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre-season.
“This kind of injury doesn’t threaten careers,” Wenger said.
It is a bone that does not heal well.
This is not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not associated with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation by Premier Injuries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have the most injury days to record.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat strength," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begin their Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger sets a rotation within the team.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta could start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need a little bit of a break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to continue through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the venues with the biggest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the judge’s scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with his management.
“This drive is immense,” Wenger said.
It’s never happened at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I’ve been in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar depictions in shows is evident, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the goal of questioning the culture, preventing men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-driven communication, with its focus on style over substance, the immediateness of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, life-affirming and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values – our inner yearning for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can’t buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
Joey’s and Chandler’s humor, frequent hugs, moments of watching football in cozy armchairs, and Ross’s longing for Rachel – all of this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of the telehealth department explained to me: “My listening role for people who feel depressed and suicidal has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference.”
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying “I’m coming to terms with it” has a huge effect, such as the feeling that it’s perceived as a weakness when talking openly about problems.”
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
So much so that my objective outsider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you’re visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, then why not take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - the total 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malm<0xC3><0xB6>
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malm<0xC3><0xB6>.
Di Maria will meet in the Champions League on Tuesday and help PSG pass Malm<0xC3><0xB6>.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took the course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malm<0xC3><0xB6> at the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who set off the French champion, but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored a header in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they not only aim to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn't a class game by Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances before the goal. He was later traded in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustrious career already in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it’s a good start to win 2:0, cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed, even though there are certain things we still have to perfect over the course of the season,” Blanc said.
“This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I’m sorry we haven’t scored one or two more goals.”
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes, which was able to hold a 2:2 draw in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was kicked out in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentinian winger was named the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malm<0xC3><0xB6> defence before passing Johan Wiland in the long corner.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a big victory, he was disappointed.
Malm<0xC3><0xB6>, who beat Celtic in a playoff to reach this stage, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who far ahead of Kevin Trapp’s post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some missteps and bad endings, not least by Ibrahimovic, who, in no less than five attempts alone, stepped in the first half and then gave up after Cavani had used him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that turned Di Maria into a shot that was deflected by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank by Maxwell.
This ended all the thought that Malm<0xC3><0xB6> could get back into the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the end result low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi opened a gate at the end.
Malm<0xC3><0xB6> coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
Qualifying games are not enough.”
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore Raises $2.5 Billion in Share Sales
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which is affected by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt relief plan.
The London-based company Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth around <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China’s economic downturn pushes demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of reference rights brought Glencore’s share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange in trading early Wednesday morning.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced the $2.5 billion share sale last week as part of the broader plans to repay around a third of its $30 billion in debt.
The company sold the new stakes at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term inhibited growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people will reach Weimar City Hall after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House said in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi’s first official in Washington, takes place on September 25 and echoes President Barack Obama’s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening, after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
“President Xi’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, but at the same time also give President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of disagreement in a constructive manner.”
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before moving on to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of contentious issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and its growing self-awareness in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
440-PS sports car borrowed and scrapped
A 29-year-old man wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway came the evil awakening.
At a company in the district of Gotha you can fulfill the dream and once borrow and drive a V8 sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
So did a 29-year-old from the district of Gotha.
On the A 71 at Arnstadt, the dream was over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, got on a wet road and drove into the dashboard.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage to the property is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 move to FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern obviously stood just a few years ago before the commitment of Spain’s superstar Xavi, who then played for FC Barcelona.
Eight-time Spanish champion, three-time cup winner, four-time Champions League winner, two-time club world champion, two-time European champion, one-time world champion - Xavi's title list is stunning.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already ahead of the 2008 European Championships before leaving Barcelona.
“I was told that Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a wanted to sell me.”
“Madrid won everything, we didn’t win anything,” he says.
This was also reported by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change did not occur.
And the decisive man for this is working today for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: “Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a has signed Guardiola and I played a great EM.”
“Pep told me I wouldn’t change, that he couldn’t imagine the team without me.”
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern’s 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against the Bavarians over the entire distance on the grass, switched off the red (4:0, 1:1) and finally celebrated the king-class triumph.
Matt Damon Plays Diversity in Filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said it will not be needed behind the scenes.
During a Sunday Night episode of HBO’s Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when she stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the chosen script of the project.
“When we talk about diversity, do it when you’re doing the film and not when you’re doing the show,” Damon said.
Brown responded in shock, with offended disbelief, and shouted "Hoo! Wow. Okay" as the actor's comments from The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think about — whoever the director is going to be — how they treat the character of Harmony,” Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a nut that is beaten by her white feeder.
The producer of Dear White People advocated for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for directing rights to the film; Damon replied that her directing "could ultimately give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded before disapproval over Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts".
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement took effect nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to ban discriminatory practices against color-blinding.
In February, the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
“Albums still matter,” he said. (Albums still have their meaning.)
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have released a statement in response to the question of Fox news personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be viewed as a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' wins first champion
Professional sports climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $1 million.
The competition show, which just concluded its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, managed to make it to the final.
The last task was to climb a 75-foot-long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time, making him the first athlete to complete the strenuous Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, however Caldiero finished the challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard-fought victory, still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $1 million.
“I mean, it’s amazing to think about how I’ve never earned more than $10,000 or had to live,” Isaac E! said of his pile of money.
All of a sudden .. like I can't even imagine how it is... the future is unknown.
Lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britons, although he first finished the track, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's making any sense about it.
He's just as happy to have done what he did.
He has received numerous awards from fans.
He is such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had swapped the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, filming will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season wasn't particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Formerly they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to climb within half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard spot.
For Detroit, though only for one night, it was a return of the three letter F word, which was so difficult to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
“All victories are fun, no matter what happens,” Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) batted 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
“I want to finish strong this year,” Simon said.
It’s hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and that’s why I want to go into the game very focused.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He's swinging the beat wood well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at (beating), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it straight into the game.
With three runs in the back at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a point, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy passed Wall, the only man he faced, before the designated rookie striker Miguel Sano, who left the right-hander Drew Verhagen a two-run.
With a pair of runners and the finishing run in second, Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe beat a double play.
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Wall scored an RBI double against the Tigers' closeer Bruce Rondon and reached the 5-4 standings.
However, the right-hander pitched Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from the start of the game from a still-moving Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been knocked out of the injury list before the game, after missing more than a month due to a back injury.
"Obviously not the start I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable when I got out and felt like I would make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, which created a single "up the middle" during the first round of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, scored another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third, ending the threat.
The Tigers placed second, scoring a one-out double from Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from Center Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
“It was a big hit,” said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by the relief right-handed A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez fell out due to a shoulder injury.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injury list since mid-August due to a shoulder injury, is due to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is eliminated from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 on four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange for LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 due to a fracture in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are expected to stay in Wiesbaden
A train carrying hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who visited it will then be accommodated in emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
It estimated that there would be between 450 and 750 refugees arriving.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, 7,500 people have arrived in Hesse, according to the government bureau responsible for the first admission.
Due to the large number of refugees, Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria a possibility.
“I believe that decisive thinking about military options of action should not take place without Germany,” he said.
He called on the European states to “collective away.”
Four years ago, we were glad that the swirl of military participation in Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict is crashing outside our door," he said on German radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive surge in international aid for the refugees on the ground.
Austria Controlled at Southern and Eastern Borders
After Germany, Austria again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV channel ORF, no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany also did not send any refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement that Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said, there have already been talks in this regard between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention specific figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, called for a special summit next week.
Germany had begun temporary border checks on Sunday.
So far, the EU countries have not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
EU ministers will take a new approach to the mandatory distribution of another 120,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday (22 September).
In view of the strong refugee drive in Germany, the Federal Government wants to support the countries in the initial admission and distribution of people.
The Bund will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after nearly four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor’s Office in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection also get it.
However, those who do not have a residence permit cannot stay in Germany.
This view has been strongly shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now has to cope with a "huge effort of force".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175-kilometer-long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent Schlepper from looking for escape routes over Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey, according to eyewitness reports, thousands more migrants were on their way to the Greek border.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the ice panzer of Saturn's moon Enceladus, a global ocean is swept.
This includes researchers from observations of the Cassini spacecraft.
According to this, the moon easily swirls around the ring planets on its orbit.
While this movement is only small, it is still too big for a permanently fixed celestial body, according to a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice cap of Enceladus.
For example, Cassini had already discovered ice volcanoes on Saturn's south pole in 2006 that spit out water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the Saturn's so-called e-ring.
At least in the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama is missing from Munich in 1860 for several weeks
In 1860, Munich had to give up on offensive fighter Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation has resulted in an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association said.
Rama had already complained of pain at the beginning of the week.
According to M<0xC3><0xBC>nchner L<0xC3><0xB6>wen, the diagnosis means "predictably four weeks of forced rest".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a terrible loss."
"Of course we have to think now," said Sport Director Necat Ayg<0xC3><0xBC>n of the "Image" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a united professional.
However, as a training guest, the Sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract at the VfL Wolfsburg.
Croatia currently has "the opportunity to demonstrate its capabilities".
Torj<0xC3><0xA4>ger Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his stroke.
As of Thursday, the Austrian national player is scheduled to enter the race training.
Okotie had injured himself in the match at Fortuna D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf (0:3) in a fierce clash at the head.
Despite his first fears, however, he remained without a serious curse.
No Diet Fruit - Mangoes Contain Much Sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
However, those who want to pay attention to its slim line are often more advised by them.
Because mangoes contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Above all, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone does not tell you how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can taste very tasty too.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet foods.
However, a mango also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, sheep and wild.
The U.S. parcel service UPS is again providing up to 95,000 aid for the Christmas business in the U.S.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
Especially the drivers are being sought.
As early as last year, UPS had raised its staff for the holiday season by 95,000.
In the face of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements since last year to be armed for the Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First a thunderstorm, then a marked cold front
The following night, in the valleys of the Alpine North side of the F<0xC3><0xB6>hn, as Meteoswitzerland reported on Tuesday.
On Wednesdays and on the night of Thursdays, the fjord partly blows with storm force through the fjord valleys.
After sunset on Thursday morning, a marked cold front crosses us, bringing heavy rainfall, gusts of wind and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently on the front page of an extensive low-pressure area over the British Isles in a powerful southwesterly flow.
On the north side of the Alps, the valleys break through the valleys at night to Wednesday.
As a result, until Thursday morning, the fennel will blow into the fencing valleys with buoys of 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in the Urnerland, partly even with over 100 km/h.
The wetland can penetrate to the adjacent central country, and even hurricanes of over 120 km/h are possible on the mountains.
While in the north on Wednesday, stormy hay provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity begins to stagnate on the alpine south slope.
This is where rain stops, which lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, the south of the Alps must be calculated in the next 48 hours with partly over 100 liters of rain per square meter, after already falling large amounts of rain in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the wind blows out, as a result of which a cold front rolls over Switzerland with heavy, partly-fat rain from west to east.
Along with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and temperatures decline significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north in the autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it becomes more sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless place in the park on Opio Hill was christened on Wednesday on the name of the German reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Luther" he is now recognized as "German Theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located right next to the Colosseum in the middle of ancient Rome.
The naming was requested by the working community of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the Popes, as a minority, were often able to live their faith only in the hidden.
With the square, it becomes symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcomed.
Martin Luther (1483-1546), a young Augustinian monk, stayed in Rome for several months at the turn of the year 1510/11.
At that time, he felt the city as a fallen sinner.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him in the opinion of historians in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther then, with his theses against the slave trade, had initiated the division of the church in the evening.
Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not in the Otmar-Alt Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has received the 75-year-old - but that is by no means equivalent to "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, it can seem quite dark.
About three years ago, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective-artistic selection from the many themes of the "Book of All Books".
Cycles have been created that focus on topics such as crusades, plagues, commandments or fathers.
As a result, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.
And there is especially the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible sites on the basis of the painting.
He interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into today's contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt’s painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical quote by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts about the particular situation.
The jewelry ribbon has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old twice allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
“There has been an education with the pipe stock,” recalls Otmar Alt.
“I have tried to work this out, to perhaps also carry me back with the Lord the Father.”
His second concern is to help art become more important in a fast-paced time: "The perception of visual worlds today is marked by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is thrown away.
Artists have a different desire and desire to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into" the images, let them act on themselves, discover and feel what power they have: "The image seeks its opposite".
Klaus Altepost stated on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation that he "always" have been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Old did not take care to fully grasp the Bible, but chose the topics that were important to him, even mysterious.
"This was not cooperation at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text only explains."
For Hans M<0xC3><0xB6>hler of the Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt’s images speak for M<0xC3><0xB6>hler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, which will open on November 15 at the Otmar-Alt Foundation.
Construction start for BMX-Bahn near
Plans were made, space was found, companies were commissioned, earth mounds were modeled for a round course: a year later almost everything was finished - but even before the official opening of the BMX railway was done.
Failures in politics and administration caused confusion, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the train.
So, the hills were removed, a new place was sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit.
The approval will be approved in October, the First City Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock has now been able to inform the Committee on Children and Youth.
“I hope that something visible will happen this year,” she said.
It should then be started without "further pause" with the work at the former indoor pool.
DFB Intensifies Commitment to Refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga is setting a clear sign on the weekend.
Football reacts to the growing situation in Germany and ensures that politics helps to cope with the problems ahead.
"I think that's the biggest challenge our country has faced since reunification."
"In principle, no one can say it's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
“It has to be of interest to everyone to tackle this issue,” said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be in the Chancellor's Office next Wednesday and there I will meet the Minister of State Mrs <0xC3><0x96>zo<0xC4><0x9F>uz and the Chancellor."
“The issue will certainly play a central role,” he announced.
Football can and will help.
However, the decisive steps must be taken by the policy.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative “1:0 for a welcome” by four years.
“About the Egidius Braun Foundation we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019,” Niersbach said at the edge of the UEFA conference in St. Julian’s/Malta.
Some federal legislators also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs are putting a clear sign if they will be wearing the "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey sleeve instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo (hermes).
“We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only,” Leverkusen’s Sports Manager Rudi V<0xC3><0xB6>ller told the “Image” newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as “self-evident.”
“The refugee drama is for everyone, no one can see it.”
“We football leaguers can, no, we have to use our radiating power, our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly,” said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim’s managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a “prominent sign of the league”.
On Friday, the women’s national team invited 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the European Qualifying match against Hungary.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community work of German football".
That all 36 licensing associations in their locations have started their own projects is great.
It is equally great that small and small clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have issued is lived in football.
“That’s huge,” he said.
In this and next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the federal government, will provide <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000 each for the integration of refugees.
“The clubs have already collected the entire amount for 2015,” Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in the event of an accident
The CEO of Europe’s largest software group, Bill McDermott, has reportedly lost his left eye by a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother’s home in the US, he fell on a water glass he carried in his left hand after midnight, reports the “Economic Week” on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeding, he was powerless, then he dragged himself out onto the street - that's what he told us last week," said "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could follow his work.
“In early October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf,” Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "full-time".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutschen Zeitung" (Thursday issue) that he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm here for SAP, I'm here for my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman, Hasso Plattner," McDermott told SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the US, but since the summer he was no longer at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
To him it is important to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Everyone can do something like this."
“It’s important to get up again when you’re down.”
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of battle...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and stated that he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He therefore comes across as little as a reserve driver for the two domestic pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button during the night race in Singapore on the weekend, as a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller im Tor
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback from Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally been shattered.
The national player will also miss the leader of the football Bundesliga in the duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19:00/Sky).
“Unfortunately, we cannot rely on him,” Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach said: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday".
Given the high strain of his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his pedigree on the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of chief keeper Roman B<0xC3><0xBC>rki.
"He's training at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League games in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
With a high probability, he will also contest the second game.
The research statement by fellow player Reus that the final draw for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, considers midfielder Julian Weigl to be clear: "This is not so wrong with Marco."
"I think we have a good chance to take down the title."
Robot Cars: Government Wants a Lead Role for Germany
Germany is to be a technological pioneer at the will of the federal government in changing the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided on a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA Motor Show about a "new age of mobility".
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport’s strategy paper emphasises, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital audio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being developed on Highway 9 in Bavaria.
To ensure that the driver "no additional liability risks are incurred", the federal government wants to "check the legal framework conditions and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to make an international effort to increase the permissible maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km/h.
The federal government also wants to work towards an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
With automated driving, the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more the passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on highways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "not to be expected until much after 2020".
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the site Germany estimates the authors of the study for 2025 at around 8.4 billion euros.
“The digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic,” said SPD transport politician S<0xC3><0xB6>ren Bartol.
However, the issue of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the German self-driving cars still look skeptical - much more so than the French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the inspection organization Dekra, presented at the AA on Wednesday, found that only eight percent of Germans believe autonomous cars will be implemented in the next ten years, 32 percent expect it only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect self-driving cars by 2025, while in the United States, 33 percent.
After all, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give up control throughout the ride on all roads.
On the highway, this could be 15 percent in the traffic, in the traffic jam 45 percent.
Almost one in four would not leave the car in control under any circumstances.
Boll announces team and double start at table tennis-EM
The D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorfer wants to score only in detail at the title matches from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision is due to be made no later than 22 September.
“This is a huge loss for our team.”
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Ro<0xC3><0x9F>kopf during the EM course in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
At that time, Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed-upon sponsor’s appointment in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
“Without Timo, the downside is that we are no longer such a clear favourite,” said Dmitry Ovtcharov, the European champion.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 European Championships in Schwechat.
"At the time, Timo was also missing, and we became European champions."
“We should focus on that,” the World Ranking Five said.
English footballer Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
During the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was met with a tackle by Héctor Moreno and was replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis was made by the 20-year-old co-player of Bastian Schweinsteiger for a fracture of the spine.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mix of a very large fashion show and a wax figure horror cabinet: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: window dolls that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who, among other things, became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna’s stage outfits – and by putting men in skirts.
“I can no longer say today that I am the terrible child of the Haute Couture because I have white hair.”
"It used to be pale, now it's real," Gaultier said.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From B<0xC3><0xBC>rgerssteig on the Run) which can be seen from September 18 at the art hall of the Hypo-Cultural Foundation, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially declining attitude to a look at his person.
In fact, he was against it, because, “For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death,” he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in Montreal, Canada, and Paris Station.
“It’s about so much more than just beautiful clothes,” said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who wrote the history of fashion without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellent choreographed overall artwork for which a lot of effort has been made: In order to hair the dolls, for example, a stylist was specifically engaged.
According to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material were transported to Munich by the makers.
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest there was another special flavor: a leather trousers outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier’s old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer’s first, bold fashion walking attempts.
As a child (he wasn’t a good student and he wasn’t a bad player in football) he wore his Teddy bras and clothes, Gaultier said.
Playing with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as told by Gaultier in Munich.
Later, I bought them, of course.
For his first fashion show, he was unable to pay for the models.
They got nothing, but were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener lace as fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines went in and around plaice to make meters.
The knitted fabrics and laces were created in large quantities for customers who further processed them, for example, into ceilings and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Fashion Peak Plauen.
Instead, fashion is again important.
In the early times of the Plauener lace, fashion played a larger role, was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt cites some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which leans on past style periods, represents an increasing potential for order.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze und Stickereien.
Only they are allowed to carry the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have been cut off.
There are almost no more private specialist shops and also wholesale.
Our products barely reach the customer in this way.
Today, mass goods are manufactured much cheaper in the Asian space and distributed almost exclusively via chains.
In addition, exports, currently to Russia and to the United States, are weakening.
There are plenty of reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to point out through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the Stick Pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have been holding a quality seal, which shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible".
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger outpost of the Westsachsische Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian space, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
It creates a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and the companies that need to think economically in particular,” says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball peak.
In some places, the machine sticks small balls.
The Plauen goldsmith master Bianca Hallebach-Krua<0xC3><0x9F>e was inspired by this: "Before I could not start anything with traditional Plauen lace".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, it shapes the pattern in silver.
“Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Tipte – young and old,” says Reuters.
It also delivers to the USA, to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in plaues and surroundings and who want a piece of memory.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney is planning a new Mary Poppins movie.
Legends are not to be touched, but Disney still ventures into a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to "Entertainment Weekly", however, it is not a re-filming, but a kind of continuation that plays with the magical little girl 20 years after the first film.
It is about the experience of the Nannys with the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
Whoever plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director already stands firm: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy more broadly to the world
The economy needs to open up more broadly to drive growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday, a group tasked with guiding reform.
"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group to deepen comprehensive reform.
Promoting new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The management group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list for regulating market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state-owned enterprises (SOE), private capital, and overhaul of the resident reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important as it assigns a greater role to the market in allocating resources, ensures a state-of-the-art business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," the statement said.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee, to carry out their activities, and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, as reported in a statement released after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the thresholds for mercury in large predatory fish and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve poison.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, sharply criticized the plans: “The risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are passed on to pregnant women and young children with full force,” explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury that, on the basis of the limit values still in force, about 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsold.
In return for this loosening, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to increase the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
However, Foodwatch referred to this as a "trick" because smaller fries, such as carp, are usually so low-loaded that they already maintain the planned maximum values today.
Therefore, the reduction in small fish is “a perfidious diversion maneuver that helps the economy alone,” Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans, which is highly enriched by the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The federal government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause, especially in the case of congenital damage to the nervous system."
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment states on its homepage regarding the applicable maximum values that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury comes primarily from the combustion of coal into the environment.
According to a written statement from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal power plants emit more than six tons of mercury a year, two thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example, in Elbe, Rhein and Danube, was "persistently and comprehensively exceeded", the "mirror" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU’s RASFF warning system.
