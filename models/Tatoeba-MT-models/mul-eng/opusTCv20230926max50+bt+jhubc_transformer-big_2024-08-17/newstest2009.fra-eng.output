At the end of the exchange, the Prague stock exchange fluctuated in the negative
After the fall on Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trades.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the trade, the Prague stock exchange resumed with its fall from the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the stabilization plan of the US financial sector, is thus also noticeable in our country.
The fall of actions in Asia
Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even though the indices managed, during the day, to wipe out some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Hang Seng index lost four percent during trading, but later it wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index following the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five per cent, but ultimately managed to reduce losses to 4.3 per cent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
“The hesitation about the rescue action in the US will affect financial markets around the world,” notes Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its own monetary policy, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will suffer from this.
The Bloodbath of American Actions
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the draft support for the financial system, which it was expected to devote up to $700 billion (nearly CZK 12 trillion).
The lawmakers thus denied the call for support for President George Bush’s project.
According to Bush, the project is expected to address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday and major stock indices experienced the biggest drop in the past 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced a drop of this magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress ceded: U.S. government could inject $700 billion into banks
U.S. Congress leaders and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of financial aid agreement to the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a decisive turn in the talks on the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of financial aid of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns), granted to the U.S. financial system.
But success is not so sure.
Indeed, before being able to publish the final version of the law and put it to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout plan will be adopted should be a major psychological factor in curbing financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which aid to markets can be effective, there will be a "disillusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent opinions on the form the package of measures should have for stabilizing the market," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could be held on Sunday.
On Saturday night, lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give the government a final form.
It should buy back from financial companies unsold real estate assets that cause financial firms to suffer considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are on the verge of agreeing on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
We still need to pursue this plan of market recovery, but I think we are there,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the declining stock markets.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the lawmakers are making sure that Congress comes to a final agreement as early as Sunday.
They want to calm investors before the start of Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress’ decision could affect Monday’s trade.
But for the moment, it is impossible to say with certainty when the two Houses of Congress will proceed to vote, or if negotiations are not likely to be blocked, at the last moment, by one or another problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, there will still be many changes in the law.
The total amount allocated to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, should be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress feels that the program is not performing its function, it has the option of blocking the grant of the remaining amount, in two steps: first, an additional $100 billion, and then, finally, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomes progress in the negotiations
Although the president can veto this decision, the Congress, he, has the opportunity to put it in a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted in obtaining funds for the purchase of bad real estate securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
“All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed Sunday with the vote of the law, and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
U.S. President George W. Bush is pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of Golden Parachute
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said lawmakers agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the settlement agreement, the progress of the time-based plan.
The new law also provides for limiting the so-called gold parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee, which will oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and will be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for real estate owners, who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new installments in the case of mortgages it will buy back, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: A psychological aid
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
“And this is due to the fact that we do not know what the mechanism and price of buying back troubled assets will be.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek told the iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, according to Marek, is not as important as that.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree, as of this week, that they support this plan and that they will dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, anticipating the adoption of the plan, matters the most at the moment," said Marek.
A fight pushed to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise you how to choose
While virtually all mobiles know how to play MP3 files, no MP3 player knows how to phone.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
Do not prevent there are enough reasons to get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a high-end expensive gramophone to put the new Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl, and from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are vinyl records in your shelves, with rock art, jazz or blues, you at least probably dream of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during travel, i.e. compressed music, to put it simply - MP3 music.
There are also categories depending on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for one reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have difficulty bearing earphones purchased for twenty crowns in the market.
There are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are unknown features, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phone calls and texting, it is able to read music and movies, record them, it has a camera of varying quality and can, for example, even serve navigation.
And if you take into account smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator can grill meat and no TV will take pictures, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without drawbacks.
The greater the number of functions you use, the lower the interval between two recharges.
And the reading of music is one of the most important energy goinfres.
There are few mobile phones that are able to read music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases, this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are much more efficient.
In the case of cheap mobiles, be aware that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, make sure you get a second charger for the job - this is true even for more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are capable, as a result of a recharge, of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing ones.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, that a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
You can, of course, record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to take it without a discount, given the tiny dimensions of the memory cards used in mobiles.
As far as readers are concerned, you do not need, except for iPod, any software.
Simply fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or by the judgment of the user.
Some devices display only an index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
In choosing a specific device, you are most interested in the battery life, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of ordering.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it only for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, it is enough for you any mobile reading MP3s.
Virtually all mobile devices are capable of doing so today.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to read.
Everyone gets to play the MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will arrive until you will have exactly this format.
It is one of the most popular formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also read WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding operator’s web pages (or those of another provider) and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason to acquire a musical mobile.
The supply of operators is unfortunately miserable and it is limited, in most cases, to radio tubes quickly made.
The prices are also not the lowest.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether by GSM, internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you’ve forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in speakers, which have virtually all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical mobiles is their price.
The cheaper ones usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, one can have a very suitable walkman already.
But, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of output for regular listeners.
The price of the best phones and the best tools, also provided with an input for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Truly anyone who manages to ensure the ordering of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the command with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even if you take into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models basically only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones come out even with 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already own a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, choose specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the ease of control approaches that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the furthest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) higher, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force traditional operators to lower prices.
It may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned many times on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> (Czech Telecommunication Office), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher for us than for the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming charges regulation, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), who has repeatedly stated that in the Czech Republic there was no more room for another operator, made choruses with the operators.
It is probably true that a classical operator with his own network apparently no longer has much luck (for now, he would only find it difficult to find frequencies).
But there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a considerable drop in prices, to which, subsequently, the traditional operators also had to react.
However, even before the introduction of party disturbances such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to those heard today in our home were heard in Britain.
Now, it turned out that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
Moreover, we are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you about the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let’s add that behind Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which owns, among other things, the U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order for their operation to be effective, they actually need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
This is how in the world, virtual operators are profiled as low-cost carriers – they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offering.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least twice as expensive as its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity shot.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
“Real men choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would be likely to work at home as well.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD>, Vodafone’s spokesman, said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
All the more so as it is relatively saturated from the point of view of offering services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the successful expansion of this project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very encouraging.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the Penta financial group, told Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were, at any rate, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible so that a potential competitor can not appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonica in the field of corporate customers, has not, for quite a long time, hidden its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
“We have a lot to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile.
And the sooner the better.
We have already held negotiations on this possibility several times with all the Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have succeeded in making progress in the negotiations,” said Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
The future may be promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we might be able to host the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by a total silence.
“At the moment, we don’t think there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared with other very specific ones.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of the press department of Telefonica O2, in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> said in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project for the time being, which could serve as a basis."
She added: “It’s virtually ruled out that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate within such a limited period of time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Instead, Vodafone directs its attention to the fulfillment of requests to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructures.
This, in our opinion, means the most input from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore a decrease in their profit.
What is the point of making it easier for such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to understand each other like larrons at a fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U:fon also bears witness to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, when the U:fon was created, was that exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by information accessible to the public from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> web pages.
Now, today, the U:fon lends itself to use as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> said: "Competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and especially his services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators as here, the indifference of the Czech regulators seems disconcerting.
However, it is not only the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at the moment, as the offer of potential stakeholders has not previously presented enough interest for classical operators," said Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa, from the Department of Foreign Affairs of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Such a statement would not come as a surprise on the part of the representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care, that no one benefits from its position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "Foreign, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services."
However, putting pressure on the honest functioning of the market and on falling prices is apparently not in the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching chord of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, arises quite naturally.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to the chance and hard fight of competition.
"The Office has not reported any signs of anticompetitive behaviour in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and therefore none has an increased corresponding responsibility for their market behaviour.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even the telecommunications regulator," Chaloupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different view of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained at all times.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that three mobile operators are visibly acting in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the company GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Repealing responsibility for <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common shift in communications, through which the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS washes hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to pass the telecommunications law, recently adopted, an extension of the powers of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement in the situation.
The representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS must know this very well, but their interests appear to be elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work
That said, the operation of a kind of virtual pseudo operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists of mobile phone services, but these are only partially public.
In most cases, it’s about companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Specialized mobile phone services are offered for example by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually only reach elected officials.
The magic round consists of the fact that the company in front of the operator is a classic company client, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it gets special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you're talking about is happening, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions we would be considering and that could result in a termination of the collaboration with the company in question," said Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity will not be reached to those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned there can be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, opposes such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-negligible profits, and at the same time, as opposed to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the manner of ordinary customers of mobile operators."
But that is precisely what should seem strange in the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, there is another question at the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has relatively broad powers to be able to disclose such activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would occur, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When We Are No Longer the Most Expensive Country
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has resulted in a considerable decrease in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, classical operators sometimes tried more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies involved in the developed countries, which were not defending the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they ended up getting the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are dealing with this issue in the manner of a hot potato, which is eliminated by transmitting it to a nearby target.
Following the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in their skills is more than profitable in these cases.
But don't throw away the handle after the cognac.
If the slide information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear at our house, the Czech mobile market may be moving.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain impassive in the face of rejection (to discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with chorus and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremi<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers Czech national anthem as one of the most beautiful anthems.
As he had previously entrusted to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rzhlas (Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of the solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to take care that both singers, as well as the chorus, have a good diction, so that one can understand the words, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech National Anthem will be celebrating its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j first reheard in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the Theatre of the States) in Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka (Kermesse des savetiers), a Czech original piece by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl, accompanied by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couplet became naturally an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
Public transport (MHD) in Prague will introduce the chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik (the Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible for about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day or 90-day voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and have it registered on their smart card in the information points and offices of the Transport Agency (the Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Kole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, Anz<0xC4><0x9B>l
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy the coupons online on the web pages of Dopravn<0xC3><0xAD> podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service in the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can definitively forget the outlets in the metro stations, where they had to so far to walk impatience in long queues in order to get paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon online and it will be recorded on their Opencard in one of the thirteen M<0xC4><0x9B>stsk<0xC3><0xA1> knihovna (municipal libraries).
"At these points of contact, there is at the disposal of the passengers a window with trained staff, which will help those interested with the purchase over the internet and, in addition, will record the coupon they have purchased on their card," says project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the lobby of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, recall the machines to compose the tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> added.
An automaton will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Simply enter the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
In the periurban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated in Pra<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xA1> integravan<0xC3><0xA1> doprava (integrated transports from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of the tickets Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal of the organization Ropid, who transports the horts.
Periurban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's cab.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the indicated place on the side of the box.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the recorded coupons.
"In the event that the passenger needs to verify the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal said.
Passengers who do not take the suburban buses and will not remember the date on which their voucher expires can rejoin the automatic distributors, initially used to register the vouchers on the card.
It is there, on the screen of the device, that the information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
Sudanese demand a referendum in the United States
In 1945, the Germans of the Sudeten Islands demanded that <0xC5><0xA0>umava be integrated into the United States.
This comes from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>esk<0xC3><0xA1> v<0xC3><0xAD>dek<0xC3><0xA1> knihovna (The Scientific Library of South Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This results, among other things, from a preserved letter in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jiho<0xC4><0x8D>esk<0xC3><0xA1> v<0xC3><0xAD>dek<0xC3><0xA1> knihovna.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov pray in the letter to the US president not to allow "<0xC5><0xA1>umavsk<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC5><0xBE>upa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation well and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, signed “People, to whom the fate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava is at heart.”
Given that the reunification with Czechoslovakia is not purportedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - that of brutality, attitude without regard, misunderstanding, oppression and serfdom, the authors of the letter now ask the US president to always take into his hands the protectorate of <0xC5><0xA0>umat.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter of a million people," the letter said.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, he would only have to hold, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat na<0xC3><0xAF>ve, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans at least had to find out that the question of their expulsion from the Republic would arise, very few of them saw such an opportunity.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would obtain for the Sudeten a certain type of autonomy.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German of <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein region's capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to see him for his Czech lessons.
"They believed that once they got home, the Czechs would be profitable to them," Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war estimated, according to him, that, following the Bene<0xC5><0xA1> Decrees, he would be expelled from the Republic.
Don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
One way to characterize the emotional media campaign is to launch, on Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
This $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and from driving alcohol.
But also remind them to take the belt before they start.
Above all, she wants to touch the consciousness of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, without forgetting professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack the emotions.
It also bears witness to the slogan "bloody" of the whole campaign:
Don't think - you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is written in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a blood spatter, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
This should symbolize that you can pay for a moment of inattention from life.
The spots will "handle" the viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen commonly with drastic images of the victims of the accidents.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whip against drivers
“What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they grill a red fire.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be recalled to drivers," says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n, the transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertisements, the psychologist believes.
Panels that signal the danger to drivers are already less effective.
“When a static panel that warns of a danger is installed, it will likely quickly merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it,” Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n said.
Olmert would make in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli Provisional Government, spoke in favor of the restitution of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), even all," Olmert said.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), because without that, peace will not be done," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked, referring to several people who were fleeing from the two attacks in the city, when he fled.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" located inside the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he later said.
Retirement of the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed support for Israel's retirement from the Golan Heights, which he said was an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a Golan Heights retreat," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to give up the constant support they accord to the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), of al-Qaeda (Terrorist Network), of the same (Terrorist Network), of the same
Questions that arise after the accident: Stewards in the car are illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic bus accident of the company Student Agency near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can travel inside the bus during the journey.
“If you want to comply with the law in a strict and formal way, a steward’s activity is contrary to the traffic law,” said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the path of the bus.
The young girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat in the vehicle, although she has two other seats at her disposal.
Now, the bus can have an accident, or even brake abruptly, also when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is equipped with standing seats or not according to its technical data sheet.
If this equipment for standing seats is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
Student Agency long distance buses do not have standing seats; this has been confirmed at Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz by the company's director Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"This is a matter that we have dealt with with with the ministry and, at first, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they cancelled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the trip provided they have their own seat," he said.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription takes care of this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement also prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The road transport law knows only the term vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," added spokesman Hanzelka with more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, the director of the traffic department of road vehicles, believes, on the contrary, that the law adequately addresses the problem.
"It all depends on the fact that the coach has permission in its approval to offer standing seats.
Everything is in there,” he said.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are standing seats and a limited maximum speed, interurban with standing seats and a higher authorized speed and long-distance standing buses with the highest authorized maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n, expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport safety, does not see the movement of on-board stewards as a major problem.
"There is no danger in regular traffic, the situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
Nor is it certain when a turbulence will occur, and the hostess of the air can hold her head."
"Now, in the event that the bus suddenly braked, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as in an urban bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewards by internal regulations," he says, and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the issue is not resolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer the services of stewards.
He hires two cents.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their profession to be a risky profession.
“However, as soon as I get the impression that this is a risky business, I will delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and their newspaper upon boarding.
It would also reduce costs,” he said.
The safety concern is the reason for the absence of stewardes in its vehicles the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, which ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have hostesses, we've been opposing them since the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, at T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz.
A huge tragedy has come.
A young hostess from the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region, who had been working for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using a flashlight and he blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter to try to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he froze it on his right side.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to book these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but with regard to financial compensation, it also counts on the culprit.
A change of law?
Not in view
An amendment to the law, which has been being drafted for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the movement of the stewards on board the bus.
"Now, it has not come to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, the maximum speed on the highway, and the use of the laptop at the wheel," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards to be a matter that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers,” Hanzelka concluded, noting that the control of the safety of buses is under the control of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorfers rest on Frankfurt.
The big words were not lacking in the letter sent by the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the entities of the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf financial institution with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central financial markets institution of the Sparkasse financial group" could be constituted, according to the mail released Monday.
The WestLB would bring a “competence block” doubled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive blow to other concentrations in the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee is trying to demonstrate its capacity to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is still under a lot of pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority that has, only recently, made it clear to the Government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was counting on seeking a future solution.
However, it has been a question for some time - also on the side of Frankfurt - of a relationship of some form between Deka Bank, which knows Sparkasse clients by their investment funds, and WestLB.
The head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas told at the presentation of the figures of the end of August that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, either the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each of which is supported by the banks of the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder and the savings banks, has appointed the Steering Committee to conduct discussions with the WestLB for joint business activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it.
The talks, however, have only just begun, it is said in the financial space.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, counts for one of the most important employers in Frankfurt’s financial district, comes into play when it comes to consolidating the savings fund sector.
In 2003, it was believed for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Land Bank of Rhineland Palatinate and the Halbab.
However, nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
The plans had scarcely been made public that the government of the Land of Hesse was speaking against any participation of the Hellaba in them.
After that, the other two houses did not join either.
The Land Bank of Rhineland Palatinate was attached to the Land Bank of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the regrouping of the Deka-Bank with L<0xC3><0xA4>nder banks.
Last but not least, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, spoke out against any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Irrespective of this, the feeling seems to be spreading that the grouping of the various public sector establishments is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian Land Parliament has passed, a union of BayernLB with the Land Bank of Baden-Wuttenberg could come to fruition first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure on new mergers was to increase, the potential partners would gradually escape it.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far resisted the crisis better than the banks of Munich and Stuttgart.
Hesse-Thuringe’s savings and transfers group, which owns 85 percent of Helaba’s capital, pulled a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
The NordLB would remain rigorous.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, only reflect one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely which business model should ensure the future capacity of L<0xC3><0xA4>nder banks, had not been resolved by the German grouping of savings and transfers funds.
In the end, a playoff of the WestLb could take place, a playoff that is obviously not desired here.
This is also what is discussed in the letter of the existing Steering Committee: in any case, a 'global solution' for the establishment would be sought.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, almost a ton of five liters of Kaiser brand beer, stands a well-built barbeque that shows about 200 visitors to the beer party what deep sounds its owner can produce.
Elena first taps Luca, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta nueva station, four buses depart tonight at 23:45, <0x60>destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arrival scheduled at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travel exclusively from Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot, South Americans are singing bears and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also loud, explains Marco Guarda, it’s not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with fake fur and glasses with large silver frames.
For five years, they’ve been going to the beer party, already three laps only this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and go home at 22:30.
Spending the night would involve unnecessary expenses, explains Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with Bavarian law of purity, health insurance and a head of the German-speaking group - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already buses run at night on the Autostrada direction <0x60>Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes calm in the bus, travelers sleep.
Better yet, they will still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates will once again take a break just before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco’s group finally arrives at six thirty as planned on the parking lot near Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Square, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco makes one last speech, explains the attack plan.
First of all, take a look at the little yellow hat.
Above is written on the left <0x60>Beer Festival', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency <0x60>conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: ‘When the doors of the capital of beer open, we run,’ cries Marco in the morning.
<0x60>Run!' Run and reserve the seats at the bottom of the tent.
'Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, we have to distribute them in the room!'
The chop, cries Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the order!
<0x60>Show the security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they are gone!”
Thirdly: ‘To be back here tonight at ten and a half hours!’ Understand?
And that's it, it went to the beer party.
Along the way, someone brandishes yellow hats to the trees to find the way back, to the panels and even to an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We're supposed to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the ‘Italians’ weekend.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 who set off across the Alps and crash into the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come specifically from Italy this weekend.
The police in Munich are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross who perform statistics on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the Hofbr<0xC3><0xA4>u brewery tent.
Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate Shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance that the politician would use the word 'relatively' and that he would slip that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This one actually happened this weekend.
Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), alongside DAX, receives a $1 billion loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits were granted up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would thus be entitled.
The money comes from both private banks and public law banks.
In the background, it is the subsidiary Deffa that bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, been refinanced very short-term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since due to distrust of markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, while the equity ratio had also slightly decreased from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
The current and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period the previous year, down to zero, the profits from the allocation of defined receivables and securities as well as the termination of provisions in credit operations had fallen by more than 5 per cent to millions.
And it is only thanks to the significant profits derived from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Deffa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the deficit of gains increased by about 16 per cent.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier had initially misconceived real estate industrial credits, which had then been branched out to Aareal Bank.
Because classical state funding was not profitable enough, Deffa had then engaged more intensively in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private and state investors (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Hypo Real Estate must make amortizations that should have on the calculation of the group's gains and losses an essential material effect that is still quite vague.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had been cut to two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of the Deffa, Hypo Real Estate has been a very important investor in state and infrastructure.
It is stronger than other refinancing institutions in the interbank market as it has no client deposits.
With the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of credits between banks was again considerably tight, with banks having accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a short-term means of refinancing for a portion - about 50 billion euros - of all Deffa credits annually.
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the group's need for financing is met with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of state of operation at present.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through the funds until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have to rely on medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Establishment (Bafin) are based on the principle that the Hypo Real Group’s market capacity is now secured.
The bank’s shareholders and creditors have nothing but hope for it.
However, in view of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is also not unthinkable that funding should not be used in its entirety.
But the opposite cannot be avoided either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest announcements, still at the door of insolvency at the end of the evening, this rescue for the least provisional will not succeed in reassuring the spirits either.
The share price fell from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The bond prices, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While the debts to the first boss have barely moved, the rates of the second-tier loans are escalating.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg Hypo subsidiary and, of course, those that have a lifespan beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate bank previously seemed to be an alternative speculation investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that caused the crisis to enter the institution by the buy-back of the bank.
As long as emission institutes, governments and less-affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, a resorption of the delays can be expected over time.
Or it will happen what no one dares to hope for right now – that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of a partial nationalization, the probability of approaching certainty has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should book nights of insomnia primarily for long-term creditors about deciding whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they’ve drawn a line on to constitute a deferral of losses for the next few years on the income tax on equity capital gains automatically deducted.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is due to attend Tachibana High School for the first day, the girls start to laugh: Germany is so “kawaii”!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she speaks of Japan.
“The first day of class in Japan.
What was it that I was excited about?
I was already on my way to school and I was scared.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, thankfully I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be fixed as strictly as in our country in Lower Saxony.
The students appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until at nine o'clock less than twenty, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I don’t like to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn’t have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue up socks and black leather shoes.
So in this outfit, I showed up in front of the pulpit, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low calls, bursting with laughter and making signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew him already thanks to my manga.
It belongs to the vocabulary indispensable to the survival of Japanese adolescents and means "friendly, cool".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor for the correspondent to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was pretty quiet, but when the gong resounded, I was assailed by the rules.
Everyone was talking to someone better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's pretty hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all came out their Bento.
My host mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really different from the miserable German casseroles.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sauces, a cucumber salad and algae, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what exactly I’m eating here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the salty plums confits, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of being able to make the boy's acquaintance a little better during the break.
I read this in my manga.
I'm curious to know if I could watch it here, too.
“Why Japan in particular?” my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
So I always replied:
"Because it fascinates me, what?"
After all, reading manga, that’s what I’ve loved for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and culture that is there, at one point, I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, you and customs.
And here, they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have sensations.
A rat or a cockroach flees from danger, does that mean he also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he experiences the same thing when he behaves the same way we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without which I or anyone else has until now been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, one can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or generally of consciousness, we enter hard-to-work terrain because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees, or attacks.
Humans behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a similar subjective experience.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult to transpose our subjective experience to that of animals.
One aspect is that the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and management and execution functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
At least for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to suppose that the human being differs even from the other primates.
Another significant feature could reside in the linguistic nature of man: since much of his existence is related to language, it often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness should not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is so difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, is neither allowed to be measured nor, because of this particular Hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its observation causes us great problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without taking into account their content, and this is exactly what happened during studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what does this mean for the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a conscious brain of its own activity.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the state of mind in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its sequences, such as the reactions of the body) captures living memory.
In this way, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our voluptuous nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others than ourselves.
On the contrary, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations from primitive activities are born in the regions of the corporeal sensation of the Cortex and the brain stem, as well as Jaak Pankseep which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
As this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could fully participate in transversal sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I can't contradict it, but I think it's unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in both Men and rats is probably as felt as it is in both cases: how could one check whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach flees from danger, but what if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain stems, but cockroaches don’t even have a brain.
But is the brain stem at the origin of sensations?
And even if one could prove it to Man, how could one prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is made on the nervous plane to the extent that the same is observed in rats and in humans.
Since I don’t explore language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I don’t know if they exist.
One might judge this as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly leaning against a wall.
I am, in fact, an emotional pragmatist.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government considers UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships,” Wasjunik said.
“But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the calendar of the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
“We can no longer waste time.
We need to work at the maximum speed,” Ukrainian League President Grigory Surkis said.
"Uefa has been watching us all the time."
An even more radical measure has been decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act in the rules," Drzewiecki of the Polish press agency PAP said.
"We assured in a letter to the UEFA President that preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer from this."
Several members of the First Division league were already convicted in the previous season for handling mandatory relegation; in the end, the start of the League even has to be postponed to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid angry counter-attack
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about her privacy in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her ex-adulter Dennis Quaid.
He spits - and counter-attacks.
A war of the late Roses for former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors commit themselves to an unfortunate battle – in the sight and knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview with the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the marriage failure: “Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful.”
It would have taken notice of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to her infidel husband’s rating fell clear: it would be “Monsterous,” he told the 54-year-old New York Daily News that “Meg relives the story of our relationship and manipulates it.”
It would be more "regrettable", that "the punishment and upsets that involve a divorce for each child would be relived in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and soon becomes the father of twins.
In response, he said, “In any case, my life goes on.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that goes well.”
Prices of airline tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would have been advantageous again - this is the result of a study by the financial services and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and, after a price increase in the first quarter, established a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After hotel market prices have increased for years, hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined by an average of 6.9 per cent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would reside for American Express in the low price of the dollar which led to a “desire for declining travel of American tourists.”
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would be even more affected by falling hotel prices such as industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are rising by 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was increasing in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, economy class passengers have to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, very fuel-consuming, have even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, prices for economy-class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, in business-class and first-class, however, price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even higher than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this price fall would be on the one hand a slowing economic growth, the firm explains.
The demand would give way in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased pressure from competition under the "Open Sky" Treaty, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the tense situation is the removal by airlines of non-profit routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet in the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV with Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the first of the rankings.
In Borussia, Luhukay still failed to find a functional eleven.
De Kristoffer Klein. Expand. Landing disaster for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player was only late to return to the game and his shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
“We need this second goal,” said Hermann Rieger in the halls of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the dressing rooms, the half-time was over and most had raced in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of HSV for almost three decades, he enjoys a great reputation as well as former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received at the strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol took over and lifted his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Of which the orders seem to have been similar: and that it jumps with this second goal!
The implementation was lacking.
"Everything was not very nice to see today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhard would have “the desire to be more relaxed as well.”
This 1:0 (1:0 at half time), the Hamburg team owes it to a head-to-head hit by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not hurt the weak Hamburg players.
"It was a dirty victory," Marin Jol summed up.
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate its 121th anniversary this Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the fans celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional standings on the giant screen that marked their club as the first in the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to step back,” said Marcell Jansen.
It is doubtful that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the first League than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its late entrants – Brazilians Neves and Silva, goaltender Petric as well as Jansen out of Bayern FC – is training softly, but it is not shining yet.
“We need more charm and more dribble,” Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
In Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the rescue plan's failure brought down the Dow Jones temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones got a little caught up.
At about 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock market index was 10,579 points with a decline of five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The Dow Jones losers were American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could bring any profit any more.
Goldman Sachs’s shares have fallen by almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffett had partnered with the company.
As part of the bailout plan, the means must be mobilised to purchase what is known as "broken mortgage papers".
However, the amount must not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the state should recover options on the actions of the financial company that can be exchanged in relation to the course's evolution in order to reduce its burden on the Public Treasury.
The courses of the actions aspirated in the tourbillon in Europe and the United States
Billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not pander to investor concerns.
The stock price of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index collapses despite the rescue of the state’s planned financial market.
Spectacular declines in the rates of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The action of the Bavarian real estate financier has lost three-quarters of its value at the moment despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank has blamed a decrease of more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the important psychological bar of the 6000 points and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Worldwide, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion hefty bailout plan could not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809.25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate is expected to follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also had only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index reported a 3.2 per cent decline for the moment, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11,743.61 points after an increase of 1.26 percent.

The commercial and tourist multinational has also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Due to soon-frozen fuel lines, death cries out the threat.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they obtain an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example Earth.
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
That’s what researchers have been amazed at for years: Flying objects don’t always behave 100 percent the way we expect them to according to the venerable laws of gravitation.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the level of speed.
Probes suddenly become faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They named it the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still believes it hard to believe that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
“Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to Earth,” he wrote.
Space researchers have known the existence of black matter only for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it an attraction force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, particularly no visible light.
According to scientists’ calculations, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The Sudanese raiders had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting prior to the release, six hostage takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom would be already underway.
The Germans are constantly in the collimator of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Al-Arabija Arab TV channel and the Italian media have reported together.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are well behaved and safe, Egyptian national television reported.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the hostages were released remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the abduction, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting at the station.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom,” the agent said.
It was only to collect the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" happened.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday shot down six of the raiders in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostage takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money had to be handed over by the German woman of one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom said that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to free the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men had to be held until the raiders found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the story.
Abusing a father-in-law who leads to suicide
A court has been informed that years of abuse by her father-in-law have led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was jailed for six years after admitting eight heads of indictment for indecent misconduct.
Truro's grand jury found that he regularly tied his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, to five to seven years.
Trerise wrote in a confessional letter: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that 34-year-old Miss Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and banded her before forcing her into sexual acts while her mother was working in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornwall.
Her daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Melle Randle, a volunteer assidue of the National Trust, was haunted by the abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told her that Melle Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter’s beautiful father who had written a confessional letter that ended up like this: “I would tie him and bandit him regularly.”
“I didn’t abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim had to be definitely terrorized, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended in the suicide of the victim.
And what’s even more surprising is the fact that if she hadn’t committed this act, her story would certainly never have ended in court.”
He added: "I particularly highlight, as his father and mother describe it, the effects of your crime committed over the years on Stephanie.
“Without these, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today.”
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office ministerial officer who had forgotten top secret documents, in June on a train, will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC said.
The man from the Department of Defense was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train heading for Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
“They would have thought that this case would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet Office,” he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is charged with a violation of section 8.1 of the act, i.e. of the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the highly sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Companies of the building facing the B&B invoice.
British companies in the building may have to pay a bill of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million to cover the bailout of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys' 2.6 million savers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect the money from the savers, including 59 companies in the building.
Building Societies Association (BSA) CEO Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay for broken pots...
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are released.
But the interest that will increase at the same time will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have had prudent behavior... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay an amount proportional to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will rise to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to settle first-year interests.
Adrian Coles, director general of the commercial committee of building companies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have had prudent behavior during the resumption of the real estate market now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
“We need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent the building companies and their members from paying this salt bill,” Cole said.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the whole year, which could double.
Since the building companies are non-shareholding organizations, their members end up paying the bill either at higher charges, or at lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five pennies per liter
Jerseyers have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk, from five penny per litre, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows a two-penny increase in February, and comes as a result of research conducted by a consulting firm.
Retailers have to decide if they go in turn, increasing the price to consumers.
. Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had changed for the last time, in 2002.
Bangladesh's ex-PM has been denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former PM Sheikh Hasina, who is at risk of being arrested on his return to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to give her bail because of her examination for extorting a businessman, Taka 50 million ($729,000) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many charges brought against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s longtime rival, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, demanded that the country’s interim military government first give him his full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release were contradictory because if she was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they could not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request saying it does not require bail given that it had been allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former Awami party leader said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government assumed power, but was released in June for treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina, like Zhaleda Zia, denies the charges against them.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign, due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign in all six provinces.
But she says she has failed to contact the children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located to the south.
A U.N. spokesman said this happened despite Taliban promises not to attack or obstruct the thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the judicial battle of ITV
BSkyB lost its case following the judgment of the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission stated that MSkyB’s participation in the past had prevented competition and had allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 following an agreement to actually prevent NTL, now known as Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that the purchase by BSkyB of ITV shares raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, thereby inciting the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin’s boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and regulator Ofcom were all against this purchase.
BSkyB has retorted that forcing her to reduce her ITV shares would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just renounced her voting rights.
A new investigation into the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to verify the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole was born from the account of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
The Special Prosecutor, Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation, lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
“Serious allegations of potentially criminal conduct, not grounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved,” Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of his biggest recommendations.
The dispute began in December 2006 with the removal of nine U.S. prosecutors from the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were fired because of mediocre benefits.
But then it emerged that the fired prosecutors were no more critical than their other colleagues, prompting some observers to attribute political connotations to these dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others reportedly refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting the courts for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, eventually accused himself of being involved in this dismissal case, and in the end, he resigned.
A number of departmental justice officers also resigned from the Department of Justice.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "the first person responsible" for these dismissals, and ended up "abdicating" his role as leader," succeeding remarkably not involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush's former collaborator, Karl Rove, have been critical of failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic must be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored at the Q Awards for his epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to receive this recognition.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title of the hit of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The night of the award ceremony is presented by Coldplay, with this year a limited selection of four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly a party.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was commercially released in the UK, as a single in 1979, ranking 15th.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained in the English charts for nine years, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name- has suffered from a health problem in recent years, even undergoing surgery to heal his heart beat became irregular, after falling on stage, in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then he was found a cyst in the vocal cords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and May Soon Be For Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents can't give directions to go to Extra Place, because they've never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide by 120 feet long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repair Extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to the shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-time neighbors, said to be charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the house pie.
But the City’s Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development, which manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the neighborhood owner committees, city agency and Avalon Bay representatives drafted a proposal authorizing the real estate developer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the city’s hands, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There are only a few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to retain Extra Place," she said.
“They could propose to rehabilitate and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public.”
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repair the small street and install seats there, some of which would be used by a cafe to which the manufacturer will grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay’s spokesman, said that while the company wants to exploit the street, that doesn’t necessarily mean it wants to be the owner.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to relook at this abandoned avenue, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city that suggested the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street well, stressing that the agency’s mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place bears this name since 1802, when the legacy of Philip Minthorne's large farm was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since been abandoned.
The back entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of the Ramones album Rocket to Russia.
“This place was beautiful,” said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of irons, hails, barricades, posters, leaves and strings."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the East Village’s evolution to luxury, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarity—a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be recorded in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: An Am<0xC3><0xA8>rement Nostalgic Look at a City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow, dark bag-ass, day and night, and bounded by the doors of a rusted iron warehouse and persians, full of newspapers from last week that fly along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always has the same allure.
A rat runs agility at the bottom of the street, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce beer bottle, sits next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
A few passers-by said they rarely thought of Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, for his part, said he believed that some of the underdogs appreciated the street’s appeal in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “have taken place in dark, wet and disgusting places.”
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates’ position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former California student, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think. Why Middle Classes Should Be Able to Choose Their School.”
Attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example of this.
Mr. Obama’s campaign emphasizes that “African American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama’s education program particularly supports among so many other topics, “bilingual transitional education” for those who learn English.
However, the question that arises for Obama is whether his desire to pursue a bilingual education that defends instruction in a class of languages other than English, goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are largely Hispanic, and low income.
More than a third of the students, made up of many new arrivals, study English.
Of the CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 state of maths exam, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students have passed the English-language-arts exam.
This incredible success was achieved thanks to an ingredient other than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street is focused on analysis, practice, constant capacity assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here’s an example that Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, head of Sixth Street, this school has instituted the instruction of the English language “full immersion.”
The total immersion in the English language focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Ms. Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you were going without her class, you wouldn't have had a chance to identify her."
"It works," she observed, "it worked for us."
Mr. Obama should not take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results obtained by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education obscure the prognostication of the answer.
Although it is favorable to the fact that immigrants learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he proclaimed that we should all stop arguing about the English language law.
On the contrary, he said, "you must make sure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than demeaning them or considering them as insignificant.
The net fall of oil following the New Concerns of the World Economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, as people fear that the bailout plan in favor of financial moves will not be able to bring the economy back to life.
Crude oil futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel, the New York Mercantile Exchange, during sales this morning.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After experiencing an increase of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 per barrel last month, before rebounding again in view of the deep uncertainties of financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again worried despite the rescue agreement, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the very last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will purchase the Wachovia Corporation's banking operations, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have in part nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said the week-end frenetic negotiations, concluded with the bailout deal, “seem to have failed to revive the market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape this contagion.
“As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular, in China.”
Bank analysts have cut their expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, so they were forced to decrease by 20 percent, oil and gas price forecasts for 2009.
The celebration of the Second Determinant Time for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he had seen it all.
He was looking at the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," Ellis said.
The second half began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played sally under dark clouds.
Then quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass to Laveranues Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor to an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds into the half.
“I didn’t get out of my zone,” Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
“He’s a poor player.”
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense was beating Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards until the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens escaped the ball because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of Bowens' ball could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard goal taking an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best the Jets could have scored in a while.
“The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said ‘the second time or the third?’
When told the two- the Jets let 21 undisputed points pass in the third half- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second half more than the third.
." A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, exceeding her world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, an Ethiopian, once again proved worthy of her title as the best bottom runner of the century, after beating her own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a 2:03:59 victory of an accommodating race on the plate, Gebrselassie beat his record of 27 seconds of 2:04:26, played last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, from the marathon’s 1600 metres.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing—may be exaggerated in today’s eyes—that air pollution does not increase her asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees from the start, 55 on arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into background runners, have contributed to the decline of the marathon record of more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05.
After Sunday's win, Gebrselassie told reporters that he had suffered from cramps in the calf two weeks before, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I got there last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best."
He has been accused - especially in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia - of having too much orchestrating his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually counting on the hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering more world records than the meaning of the race.
But this criticism does not diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie’s abilities as a background runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. on my way.
Two Kenyan elite racers, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the leaders disappeared.
A little over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final climb to break away from Kwambai, which finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year earning the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Englishman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone who won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She was not allowed to participate in the Beijing Games due to a hypothetical back injury, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a skillful strategy, allowing the Ethiopian and Kenyan group of runners to take a good advantage, then surpassing them about 18 miles 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 later.
Ethiopia's Askale Tafa Margasa came second in 2:21:31, while Kenyan Helena Kiprop finished third in 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, Pride and the Trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, lies a small quiet town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first completely black town to integrate, childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so easy to make these days." The city at five lakes, three short croquets, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goons, two is
It has now become a pilgrimage town.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in a variety of ways, the city she describes has become a tourist thanks to her inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project- remains a place apart.
She is as independent, worthy, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston told us that the rural black population of Florida was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, we don't know what he's missing."
Although this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also invoked an open dialogue on the topic of race, many here remain cautious from a foreign perspective.
“We’re very careful about how to tell the story,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a long-time resident and the city’s oldest parishioner.
“It needs to be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and combat.
It represents both a historical model of a takeover of blacks as well as a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point, but also an example of a southern black rural culture—sometimes defiant, sometimes acclaimed—that recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere, dialectical books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide turned this city, located just off Route 17, a road that crosses downtown Florida, often forgotten, which ends in a chapter of black history and human drama.
Audacious as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parties.
“Passed the road on the left,” she writes, “you’ll find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and these well-preserved play areas that Howard Miller has always taken care of, though he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can serve people passing by.
So, in barely a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with a self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not like that.
It wasn’t actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora well described the reality," said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's young girls who Hurston immortalized, citing colorless songs, performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added: “Some people didn’t appreciate it.”
We still remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who often returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, on board a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and was wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed at her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But he adds, swinging in his chair from the back patio that overlooks Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
At Hurston's death in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she used to be a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don’t think they understood the contribution or legacy it offered to the world,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a Hurston biography published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County public officials wanted to pass a five-lane highway into the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the community’s two-lane main street.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over race mixing led to hatred at the doors of the community.
“At that time, a band of white youths were throwing oranges or objects at people sitting on the side,” Franklin said.
"a lady has even died."
They threw a patch of their car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court’s request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education “insulting rather than glorifying my race.”
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened young people's confidence.
“The black children used to be kissed—I remember well—we kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening, too,” said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins as well as Chief Guard of the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until the teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
“You wouldn’t kiss your white teacher because he’s white — I mean, there’s a line of cultural demarcation here,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston-black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as she, armed with joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: "How can they deprive themselves of pleasure!"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's anonymous grave and began to struggle to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography about Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best-seller, reintroduced it to American guns.
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville’s most famous girl had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences this highway would have.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the proposed highway.
"The fiasco of the five-way highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Melle.
Melle Boyd summed it all up by stating that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A mono-themed library (renamed of course Hurston) will open in 2006, on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, renovated.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be considered a back street on a summer rainy day, as small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(There are now 90 percent blacks.)
Strangers who come to discover the story of Eatonville, his reason for being, are still treated with caution.
You have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things—such as the walls of the old Eatonville church, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields—must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Miss Jones, a courageous teacher who has a low for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will not be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular, tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed as the other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is well of sincere civic affection that is heard in the voice of Franklin’s nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger ones, like 11-year-old Alondra and 11-year-old Alexia Kenon, twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned the description of Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, who pass in this area there, will think, ‘Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,’” Alondra Kenon said after the mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
After all, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stood away from the kiosk and huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t realize they’re in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, have been spending the worst “working day in the office” since the 1929 crack.
Deliverers continue to sneak on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffins trays for morning meetings.
Latinos always drag between the residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hung on a yoke placed on his shoulders.
Office workers continue to queue up to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4pm and 7pm on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I was planning on working late in the afternoon, as I would discover my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, about twenty people making the tail.
Not in front of cashier’s counters, or to withdraw cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service counter, where regular customers ordered their checks, tourists asked for management for the Macy store, and new customers would open accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker", all queued for the same reason as me.
Not the same way, because they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, and that claim to treat customers like their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327-dollar bank has resorted to bankruptcy, and while New Yorkers were returning home for the weekend this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and store employees who are in front of me, afraid of another potential breakdown, have transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, the one that makes the most bailout on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
“I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and its slim CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge in my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or deliveries from my fruit and vegetable merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
“I’ve changed, I don’t want to take risks.”
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria swings to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who has left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right wing Vlaams Belang, are taking part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "city against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs illustrating mosques in red striped.
The police accuse the far-right extremists of having desecrated an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend of the victory of the far-right political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun Cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; according to the police, this is an organized action.
Criminals have painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, detectives think this could have been done to disguise the extremists’ sense of hatred of Muslim immigrants.
This accident could in some way be related to the elections.
A spokesman for the Islamic local community said it was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this profanation, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that touches its end.
Austria is seriously considering regaining its courage, as a result of its swing to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which accounted for almost 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led an anti-immigration campaign, some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, to be xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, led his campaign against wearing scarfs and burkas, and even voiced his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to avoid the rise of Islam.
The two parties tried to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out just after the elections have defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who have made the difference, because they are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter has banned travel abroad.
The courts have banned the glamorous rock star, Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed his intention to travel to Spain through France to the authorities that controlled him.
Police in Kent issued a travel ban last Thursday after proving Glitter’s guilt for child sexual abuse to the magistrates.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing in Ashford's limited court, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: "On Thursday, September 25 at the Ashford court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present at the time."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leaving to be registered in the list of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss any particular cases or potential Glitter movements in the county.
A Kent Police spokesperson said: "The Kent Police will do everything in their power to protect our children like those from abroad.
"In our view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
“Protecting Kent residents is Kent Police’s most expensive intention, and we closely monitor the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimize potential risks to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month, after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, 10 and 11 years, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he said he did not feel well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from controlling passports, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and so he was forced to leave for Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the limited jurisdiction court in Uxbridge, West London, for the record in the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the UK for possession of images of child abuse.
A Ministry of the Interior source said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior was reassured and glad to know that Glitter had been banned from travel to France and Spain.

The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other, the person.
Inseparable except in privacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where one discovers intimate gestures and stolen looks of artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of a few stagings with singers, dancers and guitarists with this lesser-known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the Flamenco Photography Month programming, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, bigger every day," explains the creator, who explains that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typified images.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of conveying on stage passion, sadness, joy... by capturing the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you do not have to take photos on stage.
They have a clean personality and character.
What interested me was creating an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the personality moments of the flamenco stars.”
With the festival "Chant populaire des Mines", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, recalls classical photography.
The implementation of various stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about dancing or singing in and of itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the public with his art.
The search for essentials and magic has been the constant of this work that is presented these days at the gallery El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project turned into a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book collection of portraits exhibited at the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of Old Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph people's portraits, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a moment more or less.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult kind.
You find yourself in front of people, characters you sometimes don’t know or who leave you only a few minutes to be able to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco - people", is on display at the Galerie El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata, located at number 20 of rue de la Mata (street parallel to the People's Square of Hercules) which will be open until October 16th.
Vargas Llosa admits that the novel he writes is “really bold”
The novel takes place in places that no one knows about and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he is working on, a novel that has for the main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived twenty years in the Congo and is passed by the A'ma.
The Nobel Prize winner for Literature admitted yesterday at the Hay festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it "is a real daring one" and that "everything shows that he should not write it".
“If I were reasonable, I wouldn’t, but I’m going to do it and I hope to finish it,” he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts which for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists parade in the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and completed his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award with the majority of the participants’ votes, filled the room at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself in the face of a fascinating audience who did not see the passing hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, retraced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "how he learned to live in the new
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is pure fun, an ephemeral experience", pointed out Vargas Llosa, who said that this "has no effect" and "was not afraid to"
Bad weather destroys Pozoblanco fair
The flag celebration that concluded the bullfights at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after horse-drawn toreadors verified that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Boh<0xC3><0xB3>rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather has caught up with this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
Saturday is the rain that prevented the celebration of the second bull race planned.
On the poster there was José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista, who had to face each other in the arena of Castilblanco.
So only Friday’s party took place.
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was worn in triumph, after making arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The very afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two flags planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered stairs applauded more than his fight itself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the Los Llanos arenas without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Five hours less than ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Euskadi police (L'Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armin<0xC3><0xB3>n (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two begin to flee.
His load, more than two tons of hachisch, what to stop them from.
The police pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A. A. J., according to information released by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident occurred when different officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle control on the N-1, at the border of the Municipality of Armin<0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, abruptly accelerated, and control began.
Police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further down the lower side, where the two occupants descended to escape into a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hachisch they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch balloons, then transferred to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "falsified" as it did not match the one written on the grey card of the van, which is also why they accused the detainee of a falsification of documents.
Ertzaintza continues his investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A.J., was alerted to carry out the various procedures and will be tried within the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of a drug
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda from the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California police patrol that revealed to People magazine.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "foundly leaned on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going back and forth several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, noticed that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of her vehicle.
This person, at the time, called the emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
“She looked disoriented,” that’s why the agents drove her to the drug and alcohol specialist center to conduct a test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was dismissed from the outset, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalucian Federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The General Coordinator and Member of the Left of the Union, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of carrying out treatment.
"In those cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to take on its responsibilities," Llamazares said of the political party's behavior, which he will have to adopt in the Seville City Council.
However, the leader of the Union Left called for the investigations to be "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva might have committed: "The Union Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has “very strict ethical codes for all civil servants.”
"Blood of Mayo", Garci's bold bet
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Blood of Mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with almost 15 million euros of budget.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the top of the long list of actors.
The two-and-a-half-hour film, Blood of May, will be released in theaters next Friday, which will then become a TV series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’ literature, José Luis Garci assures that with this shoot he has realized “a dream of a child” thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to shoot a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2nd Madrid, which he has always accepted.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 million provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that has been mistaken as a leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence has led the people to revolt.
But the filmmaker regrets not having received funding as for the films "Captain Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Mayo's Blood" - because he was unable to shoot some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with whom he collaborated.
The filmmaker of "Back to Begin" influenced his usual way of working, the staging of the actors, with whom he usually repeats before starting filming and to whom he does not cast, since it seems to him "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker to be informed is to be understood".
Many actors in "Blood of May" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times an Oscar nominee (he won one), Garci considers that the three films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Blood of May", "Seven tables of French billiards" and finally the winner, "The blind sunflowers", are not representative of the Spanish "mequileum".
With this film Garci does not expect a price.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize you’re only working for prosperity, and now you’re just making one more film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n puts herself in the shoes of the Sevillan dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will pay tribute to a also Sevillan dancer.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and who at the age of three will live in London with his family.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
She had an exciting life, a pioneer of women’s liberation, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated for the abolition of corset which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe of the interwar period, fascinated Isabelle Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter offered me to play the Sevillan dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me.”
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The title of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the dance of the butterfly" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the dance of the snake" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to hers,” she says.
The staging was made thanks to two notable contributions: Miguel Poveda's one that would again sing Isabela in one of his shows, as he had done at "La puerta abierta"; and Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally well wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I’m happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me.”
The stage was also made thanks to the musical composition and the guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the percussions of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the violin of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanqui Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in places so far away, especially for the time, as in India, in the United States, or in Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think it’s these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and showcases her work,” Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n said.
The show will begin at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a newly married poet" concludes the Triennale
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a Recently Married Poet" in the Church of St. Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of the Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a de la Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" comes to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: This People of Light" which was inaugurated in New York from May and was inaugurated in May.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a newly married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was a part of that.”
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice", and illustrates well the desperation of American cinema, and of the whole of America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had a hard time getting an Oscar.
He hasn’t played since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels exceeds any expression, and now I’ve lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better because of its existence.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and homeland has died during a particularly obscure period, where terrorists and stock markets are afraid, the esteem of Americans has fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and without a reason to live, it remains to human beings only admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drug fight created in honor of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that had difficulty imposing itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to either nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond had died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the peak of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
“He put us on the high bar,” said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today who tries to break through the screen like Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and away from goals.
It’s still not easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, whom he was loyal to even though he did not miss opportunities to not be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his girls with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
“Among all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as that of the devoted husband, the loving father, the thoughtful grandfather and philanthropist,” he says.
Madrid in the race to organize the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can host the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday’s race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would have been the subject of an elimination note.
But let’s examine everything in detail and from the beginning.
Errors begin with the removal of the backsliders, which forces you to go ahead.
This is not bad but if they make you move it would be better if they give you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, not
They made you go there just to take the back (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the shirt (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy that small-sized jerseys with less fabric and then cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Apart from the fact that it is necessary to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, in addition, it is necessary to leave its backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and raids of the barracks took place.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, we won't even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that, I think, didn't correctly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, this one would not come up with the idea.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Microsoft Emerging Technologies conference, a new system of image recognition and human interaction was presented, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, sending the shuttle to
Through a camera and facial recognition system, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remembering which positions they occupy - and listening and listening to the key words of their conversations.
But also group them by conversational groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but realizes that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she's here to visit someone and she tells her that she'll respond to her in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But, of course, that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we discussed in addition to a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and there will be no more associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of useless applications, they would go five times faster.
This is a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding features and "extras" to Windows.
Change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on Google’s part to compete with Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for the computer hardware and software to be understood.
It does the same job as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never go away, but one must see the “death” of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We turn on the computer only to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing through windows.
Who is responsible for half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can do the most can do the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, month-long, less complex.
At the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of the restrooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, one displays their request to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is delayed and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the outfit of the Association of Muscle Gays.
And if we start to enumerate all its appearances, we could also mention this mustache costaud that was lifting weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a simple men's cotton jersey, moulding and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all the others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with the sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The ' Marcel ' is distinguished from the others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (unrecognizable) that the most famous body shirts have in their neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand not only produces tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it is a pity to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
“I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn’t bother me.”
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters take their new fashion business very seriously.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new fall-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but at the same time exciting day awaits us.
What is the basis of your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s enchants us and we are very inspired by it for our collections.
I love walking around town and watching women see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Ever since I was a little girl, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to look in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers really like to dress up for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you wear the clothes, that's when you really put yourself in the character's skin.
All of a sudden, it's all connected.
You haven’t been in 30 years, has it been hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30s make me happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I’ve done all the things I wanted to do since I was a kid and it gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think you're going to be a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me to, and I also want to be a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you wait for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
That's right, I'm looking forward to them coming out.
I am a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and anxious, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I’m looking forward to the release of the films ‘The Last Hour’ and ‘In Search of the Tomb of Christ’.
To see what you think of it...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't climb the bridge to make the model.
Simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I have known her for a long time, to invite me to participate in a charity show in London for her association in support of women and the clothes we exhibited - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction.
The people that Naomi is a tender-hearted person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, a lot of things are not true.
Also, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to walk for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Alcohol recidivists at the wheel will have to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcoholism to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting intoxicating, or if it does not breathe.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now appearing in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last one year.
Its purpose is the reinsertion of the driver by offering him road re-education courses.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety as well as the Directorate General for Road Safety and the Institut Technologique pour la Sécurité de l'Automobile will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once intoxicated, the car resumes.
The alcoholock would avoid this as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the haleine and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before; or when the alcohol level of the driver is higher than the authorized one.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is at the expense of the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced offences by up to 65% during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people each year.
This measure only applies to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviors before they turn into criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means but, however, criminal reform requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental one.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as it was done in France.
In Mexico without ‘peep-toes’
At 5:40 p.m., the Spanish Air Force aircraft in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the presidential hangar of Mexico’s Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez airport.
The sun was on the eve of bedtime but his rays still forced him to put his hand as a visor so that he could see the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver if he was aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to complete their official journey.
- Ah, very well, then we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... are you from here or...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking two years.
- Ah, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
They are several to wait in the airport hangar near the red carpet and in a military row consisting of 27 Marines.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is dressed very overly and does not wear her usual peep-toes; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop at the photographers before moving into the room where the official cortege is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a Mexican TV journalist is waiting for them.
The Most Prestigious Price of Fashion
There is certainly no more appropriate place in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is certainly no more extraordinary and good living cartoonist than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in the Mango showcase at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried with emotion.
Certainly it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the competition, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With a table next door to the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown up on the heart and doing against bad fortune good heart, because of the recent death of his brother, Nati put on a garment of Mango and some of the walls of ELAH, which cut off the breath, and arms on it, arms down with his son Luis - a handsome man of almost two feet tall.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron de Rotchil ended the evening without a jacket because they had loaned them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with a pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner was metamorphosed wearing a sexy and black long dress, moved when during the night visit of the opera, a great one, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they turned their backs to us and waved at us
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the dependencies of the palace, but she showed us before on her mobile phone pictures of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez – another beautiful man riding a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked in advance, that there is no smell in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, it's life.
1001, the number of anti-stress
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to crown it all, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to bookstores on September 30.
The matinee wakes us up almost every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse when we think of the agitated rhythm that imposes our present life.
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is titled '1001 Ways to Relax' and will arrive at bookstores directly from Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If one believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquility in relationships such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' detracts from such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn’t run into your veins to restore your body’s balance and if stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind, and focus on reading.
Talking in a Dormant
Some children talk during the night.
I do not refer to those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk during their sleep.
The first time it happens it may surprise you, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
This is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquy.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, there are more than one who speaks during the night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, nighttime enuresis (pip in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very strong fevers, stressful or overexcited situations.
However, it is an unexplored phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a small quiet voice, with isolated words, whispers or vice versa with screams, tears, long speeches...
In the event that sleepiness becomes very frequent, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to get an explanation for this problem.
We have said that this is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep alteration that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV shows that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children and those who are struggling to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the sleepwalkers appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will no longer remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and so rests.
Remember that if he appears very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), don’t have the temptation to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because while sleeping, he's not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
Moreover, you will hear what he is saying, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so pay attention to how you will interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can ask him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhausern finally found his way to victory on his field after a long period of dissension.
Without making a big game, the Yellows and Blacks created the largest number of opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the match.
The pace was not very sustained during this encounter where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann who was rubbing the lucarne on a long shot, Illhaeusern was going to take slightly the ascendant and turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn on top, Romain at the end of the foot or Diebold came to taunt Dannemari's defense.
In front, we were blocking in the middle of the field and we were just leaving the rumbling Riahi at the head of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two opportunities signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhouisians by Marais, well positioned to take a rebound on a first attempt by Diebold (53e').
But the butcher Illhousiens will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return the lockers a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose any major problems to an Eleven Illhousian who has just retreated a little to "compact" his defense, except in the last seconds of the game where, after a big dive, the ball passed very close to the cross.
Sarkozy at the meeting of angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of the strength of the fishermen who greatly disturbed the access of several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, to meet their representatives there on Tuesday morning.
The latter have promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he will "come up with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of the fluctuation of the price of gasoline, which has reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the president “will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors.”
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted cargo operations in the Morbihan and Calvados, causing plugs of nearly 10 km.
Quiberon’s marina was also blocked, but connections to Belle-Isle were not stopped.
A filtering dam has been set up on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets in front of fuel depots in the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic and Manche fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades, such as the Sands of Olonne, in Vendée, where the trawlers stayed at dock, or at Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the movements of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday whether to give the movement and its participation in the planned interview with the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not leave anything" and "don't want to move to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on the gas oil, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but they estimate that the profitability threshold of a boat is reached only with a gas oil less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
Butch Cassidy and the Kid has died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes welcomed the film legend and engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian aviator tabled on 215 aircraft delivered this year in spite of the recession threats that are looming on the world economy.
The world’s fourth aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 aircraft delivered, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half, the airliner delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes much of the Chinese market especially for its range aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to divest more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have bailed out, is considering ceding more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that has been advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activity in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the file.
AIG’s board of directors met on Sunday evening to discuss possible assignments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG plans to separate include its International Lease Financial Corp. air leasing subsidiary, its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings reassurance company, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT said.
No final decision has been made on these transfers, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly cash in to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of U.S. authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders in proportion.
Analysis Paris Historique de la séance Morning Meeting Historique Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s bank bailout plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the highest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of exchanges after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-dominant Nasdaq index yielded 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed at the start of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank bailout plan that was supposed to bring some stability back to the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 for, the representatives refused the Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“This is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“It shows how much the market was on this plane,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would not arrive “too late.”
“If the project is indeed moribund ... then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed (the US central bank) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, “every passing day brings the downfall of a financial institution” in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the repurchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, signaling that markets are facing “not just an American crisis, but a global crisis,” FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday night, and the 30-year-old to 4.161 %, compared to 4.357% the day before.
Obama, winner of the first TV duel
In Friday’s first debate between the two candidates for the White House, another one followed to find out who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, took him.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaigning QGs proclaimed their own victory in this TV duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, though honorable, was not “brilliant” enough to allow him to speed up his decline in presidential polls to five weeks.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), believes it was the Democrat who pulled his pin from the game.
Among undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama was the winner for 39% of the polls, while 25% of them concede victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the expected good performance of his sidekick, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts," Clinton said this weekend.
Seventeen-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his undisputed experience in foreign policy, while emphasizing his opponent’s “naiveness” to these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” he accused several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be president,” he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television commercials.
Obama said he was representing the future.
Without disassembling, he turned out to be concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States around the world.
“McCain still hasn’t understood, while Obama, if,” he said, retorted this weekend, a Democratic spot accusing the Republican of not having taken the full measure of the impact of the crisis on the “American on the street.”
“During the ninety-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in the midst of heavy rain.
He did not even pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial downturn clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by the Americans to be the most able to save the economy at the edge of the precipice.
“The coming week could be a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to Bill Clinton’s during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle “is the final eight-year verdict of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that he would still be able to reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street surcharges, the Illinois senator also noted that the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country by promoting renewable energy systems was a priority, with the first priority being to place renewable energy in place.
McCain, for his part, wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudently, the two candidates evaded questions about the $700 billion financial bailout (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) passed by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, “Did you notice that there was an election, you?”
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday night in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislation.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening as polling stations in Minsk’s central square closed to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admit they didn’t even vote: “How good, since they will do what they want with my voice,” says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has done well to foreign observers in order to resume language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered to be proper by observers.
They were not according to the opposition.
"We have been kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the devolution," said Iouri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former presidential opposition candidate in 2006 and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in us it is the executive power.
If opposition MPs enter parliament, it is that they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions, and legislative proposals.”
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters a crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote.
She points out that the turnout seems too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the door to all manipulations.
"You noticed that there was an election, you?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls back on the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The interview - Your blood has become safe
Héma-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, as Héma-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he regained the public’s confidence that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and public outrage, the Government of Canada instituted in February 1994 a public inquiry, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would not happen again.
While Judge Krever was delaying filing his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
“In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, just 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec,” recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
In an effort to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field over the years that followed, we have regained public confidence,” she said, before proudly affirming that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94 percent of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, maintains in her mind that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, there were many cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the one that has held the fort since its foundation in 1998.
“And we didn’t know at all whether this disease could be transmitted by blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when this is not known and that a serious illness can result from it, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we can measure death.
In April 1999, the blood of people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
Now, a few years ago, it was shown beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.”
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV screening technique appeared on the market: the nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow detecting directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
TANs have shortened the wet period, which extends between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, says the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
In this way, the risk of some donors being infected has been substantially reduced and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today one can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health,” says the head of the management of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant,” continues Dr. Décary, before stressing that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
“Needs are increasing because the population is ageing.
As anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a refill in red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the blood donor network, which on average accounts for only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
Any healthy person, 18 years of age or older, who meets the eligibility criteria, can still donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where malaria is prevalent, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With these 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become regular donors.
“With today’s life so frightful, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving blood,” Décary said.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These fabrics are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth sample of cord blood and are expected to pick up more than one thousand a year.
We should start offering it for transplants at the beginning of next year," said Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
“Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it,” as Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - The Impact in the Semi-Final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL First Division playoff series, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, in the second and decisive game of the quarter-final series, from the finals to the finals.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a goalless first half on one side and the other, field midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other nets of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first game of the back-to-back series on Friday, Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win it 4-3, but the Whitecaps still got access to the 5-4 semi-final round in total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Kovalev's victorious goal
The Canadian's number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 win by the Canadian to the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preliminary matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to do too much in the first period,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
It's a beautiful ovation."
Charest set to the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out triggering elections before the end of the year
Soon after the Liberal Party’s general council was completed, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected on the occasion of today’s partial election.
"Rejecting the boundaries of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in the big lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a sort of Moulin to images.
On three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec, as seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc. were looping.
Great resources as in the election period.
In a press release, the prime minister declined to rule out that he would trigger the elections this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth bread of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, simply explained why the North was "a jewel of immense potential", but did not give a deadline, investment amounts, or a specific priority in future projects.
At least a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydropower, forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains “nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond,” according to Mr. Charest’s enumeration.
This "territory twice as big as France", "it's home to us, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it home to us, but it is in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was applying for a national founding myth.
Quebec has built up a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
“It’s up to us, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said at the press briefing.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, and when the opportunity arises, I repeat this position on behalf of the government," he said.
“With climate change, we need to rethink our vision for the North,” he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open all year round due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Peking MP of Ungava), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerned, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of Liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the Liberals who preceded us, we thought differently about turning the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a big cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival at the party’s head.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Centrale in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made James Bay, our party was able to forge the future,” said Charest.
In a press briefing, he invoked another conservative reference, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing Eastmain1a-Ruper’s hydroelectric dam project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning was scheduled for 2012.
“There’s still between us, but I plan to be there,” he told his activists, raising cheers at their homes.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering a vote this fall, which the law allows.
He points out that his schedule is however fulfilled, notably by a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, in particular "constitutional aspirations" that have been passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission and to have a veto over decisions made in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the main lines of the North Plan were welcomed with skepticism.
The Peking leader, Pauline Marois, issued the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, refused to implement it.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (the poll that is taking place today), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supported the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
“But what we want is that it’s not just a show,” commented leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns on holiday today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (ironically) at Harper's office, who allowed herself last summer to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
To cast the blame on this woman who has waged an incessant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration for saying so much about the Prime Minister’s entourage as on Stephen Harper himself.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its imprisoned citizen to the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts that are blamed on him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child-soldier to rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Let us recall, in memory, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are appealing for the repatriation of Omar Khadr for a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that is keeping an eye on torture: it does not matter that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of torture.
We don’t realize it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” the word that Harper continues to speak and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
This is the time when there is no morality left: one can be misled, tortured, arbitrarily imprisoned a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a head of government until now a minority (so what happens after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates virtue, law and order: they do not see that this government has renounced what was doing the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, she's here, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine.
Pursuing Orwellian logic, he claims that the world’s largest gold company has filed a defamation lawsuit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without the sou in order to launch a “transparent public debate”.
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
For, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to lead to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of the Black Canada book will have to spend considerable money to prepare their defenses and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers backed by the mine’s almost bottomless pockets.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is in fact often to ruin the defenders in order to impose a friendly settlement that will bully the opposition in addition to scaring anyone who dares to look again at the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before the public that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is happening in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually conducted through the exchange of ideas rather than by a no-brainer.
It was therefore sufficient for the mine to open its books, its records and to establish a real debate, through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects the back of hand petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate at the same time while disregarding the views of that same public?
In the world of the vice president, it seems that this word refers only to fat-paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does so primarily because it rejects the brutal way of the mine.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilised exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a barrage of prosecution (because of the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a settlement in place of the authors of Black Canada).
Beyond Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in block, the right to citation of credible sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that displease the wealthy businesses of this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of repeated prosecution, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic environment, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate prosecution clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, as it is for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms that limit this kind of abuse.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan aimed at curbing the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months is yet to be endorsed by both houses of Congress.
It provides, inter alia, for better control by the electors of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the return of committed public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for default of payment, and a right to look at the salaries paid to the leaders of the bailed-out companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
“Everything has been done in a way that protects the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis in Wall Street,” she said.
“This is the fundamental point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos, and disruptions to Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” Republican Judd Gregg said.
Negotiations had taken a turn in the last few hours for fear of the effect of a new failure on investor mood.
The time limit given was the opening of the markets this morning.
Associated with the negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential election proved rather favorable to the agreement, without failing to express their dissatisfaction that one is forced to reach that end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama attributed the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including the one aimed at allowing homeowners to keep their homes and the one on the salaries of state-backed business leaders.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on U.S. television.
Asked on another channel to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
“The big lines I’ve read [show] that it’s something we’re all going to have to digest and with which we’re going to be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky, and unsold debts of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgages at risk (subprimes) before it spread to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and decomposes on a bank loan.
It was a group of Republican elected officials who had the first draft of the agreement, last week.
It is believed to have come out of this impasse since Democrats have accepted that some “toxic” assets of struggling companies are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round the corner for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to take losses for five years with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of $250 billion to which an additional $100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion is expected to be approved by another congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will obtain shares in the relief companies that will be worth dividends to him in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the turmoil is over.
The federal government will have the option of delaying the procedures for seizure of housing attached to the real estate loans concerned by the plan, as well as setting limits on the remuneration and severance payments paid to the leaders of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and that of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Indeed, voices continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camp.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that benefits taxpayers.”
Animator of a small group in Congress called "the caucus of the skeptics", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred prominent economics professors, including three Nobel Prizes, have written to us to tell us: Congress is being asked not to rush and to carefully examine the way forward,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (US16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it had refused to acquire its competitor in full shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion U.S. dollars) in the US loan crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and 10 largest insurers.
"This is not money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In exchange, a right to vote is recovered from the bank and from the influence.
It’s just something that savers and households now appreciate that times are uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed about to nationalize another bank tainted by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take back all of the ongoing loans from the Bradford and Bringley bank, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion US) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the UK bank’s branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an engaged icon
Its beauty in the eyes of azure has long been its advantage card, some will say its weakness.
Had he been freed from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His prowess, sensibility and talent that flowed from the source will also have kept him away from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the early years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a kind of screen rival, more cautious in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without disproportionate ego, ultimate mark of quality.
For a country full of self-made man, of the Pacific War fighter, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale and then attended New York's Actor's Studio, before triumphing in theater, television, soon in cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second at the 24 Hours of Mans in 1979, dubbed a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow zones of this secret, discreet, committed, allergic star are also disappearing with him, whose enigma has not been fully penetrated.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
Paul Newman’s disappearance brought the vertigo to movie theaters this weekend as his big roles intersect on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation parades through it.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a burning roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we mention his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, reprised after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic villain in the brilliantly brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and vengeful in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will reprise the character on the return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 on nine nominations.
This face through the ages was him.
Again to him.
The times are moving through its course.
He is best known for his iconic George Roy Hill Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as sponsor of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes’ Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
As opposed to several film legends who left the job early enough, Newman will remain in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its bears, its fasts and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging its overly supported performances.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles fell for a long time all cooked in the beak.
However, he played less often the first youths than the marginal ones: neuroscientists, alcoholics, savages or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed poorly known aspects of his true pudical sensibility.
Her Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew an end to a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated to him his film Harry and Son in 1984, work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes that passed yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former fellow gunman Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very excitedly, "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a challenger of Hollywood’s drifts.
We will have seen much of his binette throne on cans of vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of rather bad taste, though gag at first.
However, the profits from these sales were paid to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will be committed to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
Citizen model, in sum and above.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company do in their invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings will begin, against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, which has caused particularly serious damage; other heads of indictment have been held against them, such as false and false use.
According to the prosecutor's office, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money from the state and municipalities, about HUF 65 million in total, went on the one hand in the boxes of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to touch upon the money from the subsidies obtained by issuing expense invoices, behind which no actual benefits were provided and thus, the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they procured invoices at the J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros market, while they made the caches at Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, among other things, during tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados, at the request of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag.
According to the latter's statement, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model on which they made the other invoices they were going to introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his accomplice Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with writing the files necessary for obtaining the grants.
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados's choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place has ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont S<0xC3><0xB6><0xC3><0xBC>lét.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy the place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, which would later bear the name of Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, was in error of form and background.
A guesthouse, located in Badacsonytomaj, had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. However, the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty guests.
The over-imaginative invoice issuers also fell into overstatement when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, which also belongs to the Horeca sector. In their accounting, neither Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért nor Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>’s name appeared, according to the information given at the prosecutor’s office.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s manager, told the website hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in the wrong place on the cache."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that, according to the invoice, 100 people stayed there did not stick either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
In addition, the invoicing agencies in Budapest did not inform themselves about the travel agencies of their choice, but they only organise trips abroad, so they naively indicated stays in Hungary on cash bills, which also goes against the rules of practice.
Moreover, as appeared in the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while benefits related to travel activities, the destination of which is located outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Révf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p Hotel on the order of Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért was incorrect, since the company's services do not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. In addition, the hotel employees only issued invoices, as printed
The prosecutor’s investigation reveals that the “issuers” also made mistakes by mentioning as a benefit the transport of goods by road, which the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, given that its profile was the investment council.
In addition, it is also for defects of forms, such as types of inadequate invoices and false caches, that the invoices issued to the order of Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt a Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Cultural Association and Biztos Pont proved to be false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3>’s sports internship, both of whom deny to be the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., established in Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Association was supposed to have a meal at their house.
Invoices deliberately established
Another category of invoice issuers is that of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The foundation Esely Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, at the request of the grouping of Young Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Sozialist<0xC3><0xA1>k, has established an invoice to the order of the foundation Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt in Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi.
Similarly, he cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003, issued invoices to the order of the foundation Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, of the association Atlasz S<0xC3><0xB6>l<0xC3><0xBC>get and the association V<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>sfeny<0xC5><0x91> S<0xC3><0xBC>lét, for a sum of millions.
No financial movement took place, either, given that the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this was well avoided by the agencies to mention it in their accounting.
The next category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the CEO of the company Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft., dealing with the fuel trade and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was allegedly purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov also reportedly had documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
From what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the companies Atlasz, Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> and de Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt in the Third <0xC3><0x89>vesredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, and that he pocketed their counter-value.
It is precisely at the request of Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov that Romanian Masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies worked, which the defendant explains by the fact that they did not receive work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the founding acts of the companies, he established invoices in their names, on the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3>.
Kubatov gave organizations, 15 invoices in total, issued by the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor thought that 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices as well as the VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictitious invoices that were used as part of the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generation and Sz<0xC3><0xB6>vetség for Modern Hungary submitted a grant application to the public utility organization of the Socialist Party, T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny (TMA).
They obtained this grant for a sum of two times HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To prevent this from happening, five fictitious invoices received from the company Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
Moreover, it was these invoices that were found during the search carried out in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
During the hearing, some of the defendants will report the method of manufacturing the invoices, as she had already done in front of the prosecutor's office earlier.
What could be really interesting would be that the main prosecutor, J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his statements are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the smallest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his best interests, or if so, the socialists would have reached an agreement that, in exchange for the repayment of a large part of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably tainted, since the demands for his placement in supervised residence, based on a reduction in his conditions of detention, continually fall into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater harm, and those who commit irreparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait at their own home for the end of the procedure.
The psychology of overexploitation: why are we spending more money?
When selling at auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Researchers in neurology and economics at the University of New York have managed to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, humans don’t want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that’s why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
These researches have attempted to draw up a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" using sales at experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was playing the lotto, while the other group was taking part in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (MRI) process, the researchers analyzed the active brain domains of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction of which an essential element is the overhang of a third, the set under the brainstem, called striatum, was moving intensively during the loss of the part.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the leak in the face of the violent reaction of striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial surveillance analyses.
During these, three groups over-enhancing against one partner, under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they did so.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they came out winning the game, then they would receive an additional $15, in reward.
While the third group received this $15 before the auctions, the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was placed on one victory, while on the other, on failure.
Thus proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the player team "against failure" were willing to make higher bets than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
“These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them only explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped remove the contradiction between the two theories by now leading to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
Around the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
It is estimated that patients with the hepatitis virus in Hungary are one hundred miles away, but only seven miles are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and diseases generated differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to the pathogens, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g., contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is recommended to get vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis A symptoms appear two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, usually accompanied by a poor general condition, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then a visible jaundice develops on the skin and on the white of the eye, the stool becomes clearer and the urine takes a darker color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Worldwide, every year, one million people die from the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one in ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are unaware of the virus, because the pathogen destroys the liver cells in a surreptitious way. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your treating doctor as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of infection disappears and the development of a cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its goal is to draw attention to the cirrhosis of the chronic liver, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does the one who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of painkiller, which would have already helped make the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article in which researchers at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment by analyzing the extent to which belief in God could influence tolerance for human pain.
As part of this experience for the least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were electroshocked, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the suffering.
Thanks to a palpation technique of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More precisely, the experiment takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and broadcasting electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings in a sustained way, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady in Hermine painted by Leonardo de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experiment hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, concerned its calming effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time, received 20 electroshocks in four successive parts, while looking at either the religious-themed painting or the more general-themed one.
The Catholics said that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt like "safe", like someone they were "taking care of" and they "quietly calmed down, and peace invaded them".
In view of the painting of religious themes, they accounted for 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonard’s work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, thinks that one can achieve the same effects with any other strong image, in atheists, provided one finds the appropriate photo.
“We should find an image in front of which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, Anglican Bishop, welcomed the results of these researches.
“The practice of faith should change and in many cases, it actually changes our personality,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, it is only a question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if one showed the believers a Madonna painted by Leonard or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would the sight of a better-quality Virgin Mary lead to better results?
You are what you disclose about yourself.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found at the bottom of people’s pocket as the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what are their centers of interest.
However, that is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in the society.
While with regard to skeptics setting a parallel with Orwell’s horror vision, they just don’t see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times recently that Google’s main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that Google’s founders can meet their initial goal that sounded like this: “Let’s collect in a system all the information in the world!”.
According to Google’s manager, after ten years of global change work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all the information.
To the question: what will it be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What could I do tomorrow?" or "What is the job that would be best for me?". However, the software will not be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first sight, only at first glance.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer that launches the search, and the pages then viewed by the interested persons are precisely listed.
Using the Personalized Search Predecessor program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they have searched for, what they clicked on. Thanks to this, long-term registration, recommendations, programs based on the same logic, we will be able to provide many more answers
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask the users, who are worried about seeing Google’s information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not murder, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or possibly the revolt against power that can provoke a counter-reaction in Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in this kind of legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most resounding example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Internet users concerned about human rights were able to push a sigh of relief in May last, when Google, arming above with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right to the court in front of the FBI. According to the judgment rendered, in the future, Google will still not be able to be obliged by any of the information of the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years earlier. But in the end, these two failed to obtain the most recent lists of internet searches from private users and mois)
The judgment of Google is therefore quite contradictory: it is contested by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they begin to use the services of Google. Therefore, they keep their multi-faceted company against them in the spirit of revolt.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "wilds" bringing together enthusiasts, activists and computer enthusiasts who appear in many countries see in Google the next generation of big companies, the "chained corporation", as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, even cataloged as the world's most invading Windows.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The document code and software package, constantly refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in the face of the practice of the official giant software.
The reason may also be that geeks see very exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what the Web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, pulls right behind it.
Indeed, Web 2.0 is about nothing more than collaboration, than the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use communication channels at our disposal, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link these to other services, such as on Twinter, or at last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can automatically link these to a system of pursuits, such as photos on FriendFeed or Blip.f.
While one can get acquainted with many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands in the view of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that fired one of his employees, nothing can be said of his honest opinions about the
One who lives an online life is made up of what he shows himself, and this is how one can define the principle hiding behind the behavior of today’s young people.
He wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to circumvent Google’s monopoly, he can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who, deliberately, do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the smallest. The services of Google online, through the processing of text to the processing of the image, to the reading of information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not yet connected to our day, which are no longer connected to
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion).AdWords/AdSense advertising domains threaten Microsoft's revenue from advertising agencies, but more than $400 billion in revenue, while more than $110 billion in revenue is expected.
However, critical observers find, in addition to all this, contradictions which have a disturbing effect on the company: for example, the top management of the company has rejected, in its entirety, the protests of the employees, after it has doubled the price of the enterprise motherboard and after the company has paid too much attention to the
According to one of the internal rules of the company, the new services are not announced in our database only when they can be used. What is on, is that in the coming months and years, they will make the world move on new points. While some think that the project of scanning and archiving the contents of our database will be able to
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half-tones of Orwellian, describes the future in which a man could be effusively approached only through Google data.
Two minors helped to clear the traces of <0xC3><0x93>zd's double homicide
"Police have called two minors to interrogate them in the case of the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd. Based on well-founded suspicions, they have helped to make the traces of the crime disappear," said a spokeswoman for the Borsod Department of Police.
Young people have recognized the facts that are being blamed on them, and for the time being, they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
The complicity of murder can lead to imprisonment of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double homicide of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old young man from the corner, was placed in provisional detention on Sunday.
The charges brought against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and by interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn’t want to settle his debt and that’s why he lured his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him, as well as that man’s 9-year-old daughter.
According to the information from the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the crime scene is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the repurchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the proposal that the Poles made despite the fact that the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state that wants to separate from more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid that has been made so far for the repurchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche B<0xC3><0xB6>rse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new best owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent stake, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, which is getting worse day by day, the European press’s leading newspapers already mention a “second September 11”.
“The global financial disaster, we owe it to the American president,” La Repubblica said. “The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised at last, aimed at bringing relief to a desperate situation...”
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett called it, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it is the failures of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is increasing every day, and as a result, the whole world will pay a heavy price for it.
Bush’s plan was far from perfect, however, according to the congressional vote, a real threat, one that Washington does not propose as a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just at a time when in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
One cannot ignore the threat any longer - emphasizes the Anzeiger Days of Geneva.
Some states can still lend a bailout to their incumbent financial organizations, and thanks to the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to make few cases of their national selfishness, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
Only on Monday, weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - the Vienna daily, Der Standard, recalled, adding that fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands in their pockets, very deep, in a way similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis further.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses, in part, the old continent.
The “salvators” should not immediately brand a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise to note in which case it would be rational to touch taxpayers’ money, with the aim of preventing further damage.
The smart car mimics the flight of the bourdon
What method would be better to develop technologies that are capable of avoiding an obstacle, if it were not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
For example, the bees.
In the amazing project presented at the CETATEC, taking place in Japan, the buzzing bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic idea of starting, to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a self-driving bio-inspired, BR23C-type self-driving system that it has equipped with bee qualities, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own oval-shaped space, which in reality looks a lot like our protected hull - explained Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the brand's research and development and technological public relations department at the exhibition.
The bee’s facetted eye plays a crucial role, since it is able to see in all directions, at an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the facet eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser rangefinder.
The latter identifies the obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which turns it into an avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it at an angle sufficient to avoid the collision.
Unlike any system currently in existence, this avoidance maneuver takes place entirely in an instinctive way.
“If it wasn’t, the mini car robot wouldn’t be able to react fast enough to avoid the obstacle,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the time being the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid the other bees.
The process must take place in a blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees have to avoid the other bees, in our case, we could only use rotary movement, acceleration as well as slowing down as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses polymer lithium batteries that are lighter and whose energy concentration is greater, making their lifespan longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the intelligent instinctive reaction that is paramount, not data processing, and even less the ability to store.
This mechanism should only process a few incoming signals per second, and respond to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
There is no need for memory of a capacity of giga-bytes, or even mega-bytes.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology for instant avoidance, which Nissan estimates will make its entry into series-manufactured cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on its way.
We even gave a name to the baby out of price
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout plan, aimed at buying back the dubious credit from banks, and using it multiple times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that in the course of new debates extending until after midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, congressional leaders have agreed on the controversies that have existed for days and days, around the $700 billion bailout plan.
“We’ve taken a serious step forward,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, according to which it’s time to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born out of the plan, is backed by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, however other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the wheels of the economy.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8pm, Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2am, according to Central European local time), but did not cause a dramatic rise in stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in the name of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, and then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we strongly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
In addition, the program diverged from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which it mentioned that the $700 billion would have to be spent at one time, in order to buy back securities with questionable credits.
From now on, a maximum of half of the sum of 700 billion can be spent. The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the passing of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. This first amount will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to buy dubious debts from the banks.
The program will be supervised by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
Spending the second half of the $700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: it will be able to simultaneously purchase dubious claims, securities relating to dubious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The department's competent persons stated that the repurchases may take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury secretariat guarantees the tools to cause concern, for which companies will have paid a premium equivalent to foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast buy-back of dubious claims, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system causing the collapse of a major financial institution or other.
“We will take the necessary measures, to be ready for law enforcement, as soon as it is signed,” he added.
On the other hand, the leaders of the banks in bad postures and waiting for state aid can expect their starting allowances, simply called gold parachute overseas, to be capped by the government.
Salary ceilings are mentioned only in very specific cases, and the limitations depend on how the Treasury secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The capping principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat purchases as part of an auction, they will levy a surcharge on the gold parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Immediately after the purchase of dubious claims, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not overstated.
However, in order for the image to be complete, it must be added that the existing gold parachutes are not modified. The ceiling only concerns new contracts, this in order to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal caps will be in place regarding the appointments of the directors-general - said the chairman of the committee in charge of the financial benefits of the House of Representatives, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State provides itself with a right to acquire shares in the participating banks in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can even be victorious in the case as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved will fall back on their feet.
The bill states that in the next five years, the President must introduce a proposal to Congress that will determine how the losses will be returned to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That’s not why American citizens mandated us, it doesn’t protect taxpayer dollars,” said California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa.
His fellow Ohio Democrat, Mary Kaptur, thinks that it is the same people who are pressing for action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Next year, will you still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga G<0xC3><0xB6>ncz believes that there is a good chance that by January 12, the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will come into force, which is what the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, in front of the local Hungarian community leaders.
According to her, "now, everything depends only on the moment when electronic entry and control systems beyond the Atlantic will be put into service."
At all times, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations starting today in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will hand over the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisors of presidential candidates, the Democratic nominee John Bara.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank’s bailout plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, like John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, secured their support for the government’s $700 billion bailout plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the U.S. secretary to the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives of Congress and the Administration finally announced on Sunday morning that they had entered into principle agreements on the bailout of the banks.
This funding plan, aimed at the thawing of the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain themselves, each as more apt than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the introduction of economic issues, Obama again managed to get a little ahead of himself. McCain’s advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a colister just after the Republican convention, has melted.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly vote on the $700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains the passages of consumer protection that he also supports.
“It is now that we must act responsibly ... a danger threatens your work, your economies, entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy,” he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain’s economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, “We’re all going to have a hard time getting through it ... but doing nothing is not a possible way.”
The Republican senator stated that the proposal mentions the creation of a Treasury Control Commission and the capping of the starting fees of senior leaders, and that he was, personally, very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Secretary of the Treasury.
Nancy Pelosi, president of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The Press Review of the German Linguistic Territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, is mentioned.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing information magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the CSU’s dramatic defeat in his article entitled “The Revolution in Bavaria Devotes its Fathers”.
According to this recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took up his duties.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process came to an end that was likely just ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU rose by 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devoring its parents", set up in the region in a consistent manner by the CSU.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong about the pace, but secularization, the results of education and the establishment of North and East Germans in the developing Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of the faithful.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more headstrong.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have rather distanced themselves from the CSU, such as independents, artisans, baccalaureate holders and graduate students.
In these groups, support for the CSU fell below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who? With whom? The party presidents stand on the reservation in the face of coalition issues", the conservative Austrian daily takes care of the situation of confused domestic politics that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SP<0xC3><0x96> wish to discuss with the conservatives of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The populist BZ<0xC3><0x96> party is open to negotiations and the Greens are not yet ready to agree on the coalition.
Elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; in debates organized on public television, party leaders have barely let their cards be seen.
Werner Faymann, the SP<0xC3><0x96> president, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that the collaboration of the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor, remains open on Faymann’s part.
As he mentioned, the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red proposals.
As he has already said, a collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is currently an open question, and these issues must be discussed in the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, the president of the BZ<0xC3><0x96>, is once again open to all proposals.
“To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities,” Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, has begun in Paris as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the Plenary Assembly, as one of the main speakers of the expert consultation, L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to the segregations in education, because it is a violation of the right of children to the most important part.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened, on the one hand, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and, on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the people invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz People's Party group, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka warned that in addition to the distinctions found in the hiring process, Roma disappeared from the labour market, primarily as a result of their low qualification.
"An overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have a high school diploma, and as a result of poor elementary education, only a tiny part has the opportunity to obtain a higher education degree."
In addition, J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka insisted that education as a basic human right plays a key role when it comes to enforcing other fundamental rights.
The investment in early education of Roma children means a strengthening of the economy of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the earlier a Roma child starts school, the more he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the state budget.
"By their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low-quality and sectarian education," L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
According to the honourable Member, the European Union's cooperation towards an objective and action is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the process of school segregation, which is why compliance with the existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken; the opportunities provided by democracy must be given to Roma children so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for all, the objective of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe, which has been held every year since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination at the European level.
CSU: Grace for a Transition Period
The decision on the fate of the late duo Huber-Beckstein will be taken in October
Despite this bitter electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the top of the Bavarian CSU has been adjourned.
The party president, Erwin Hube, and the regional government chief, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the exceptional party congress, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair have, in any case, made it feel that they did not have a special place in their seat.
Through this, they worked to appease the angry members of the faction and the base, who one day after the "Bavarian Tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the Christian-social union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the putsch against Stoiber, it remains only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was Bavaria's "only sovereign" giving 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
But the Conservatives still count strongly in this southern region, which is of key importance for the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal redevelopment of the party, the Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest group of recognition, which initiates discussions at the same time with the Liberals, the Liberals, the Liberals, and the Liberals.
A strange foot of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli entered the legislation, whose measure against Stroiber served as a possibility of putsch perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, to then treat without hesitation the very ambitious female political munic.
Now, the leaders of the CSU put all their energy to stabilize, one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far was pulling the strings behind him, will also take on an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber released a few sharp remarks to the CDU, which he said they would have deserved much more support from the fraternal party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will again be able to be Chancellor only if they re-establish in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, barely hiding her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of CSU’s ground will not negatively affect Berlin’s grand coalition.
That is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the wounded CSU, and the crisis of the socio-democrats still lasts.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0
None of the opposition MPs had access to the Belarusian parliament after Sunday’s election.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which assures its prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illegalities committed during the devolution of votes.
The OSCE, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislature composed of 110 people in this country of 10 million people has been very much in opposition for decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko's re-election as president
In this way, the ODSZ gave up its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, increasingly dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order qualified as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians did not receive entry visas, was one of the most pressing expectations of the Belarusian government.
The fact that the OSCE, when evaluating the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than failures, such as the ban on running for a third of the opposition candidates, referred to a prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE statement on Monday was already challenging the campaign, during which the majority of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present when the votes were cast.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political prisoners have found freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize the two South Ossetia and the Abazis separate from Georgia.
“We have taken two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has been initiated,” Milenkevich told the newspaper.
According to the candidate for the opposition in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this remains so, even though "the government has been afraid in this Parliament that has no weight, to have even one opponent come in".
The opposition does not foresee actions of protest in the light of the results; rather, it tries to get its message on the need for economic reforms among voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to have our opposing newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities put sticks in our wheels for broadcasting, but I can also see that they are more and more supportive of elections, even in the circle of people," he said.
"Due to the country's debt and the rise in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time," Milinkevitch said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratically.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts.". In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of the voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had there been revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But as of today, this new measure is in effect against the little rascals, against whom he points and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-corruption news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
“The revolving doors,” says Brunetta, “are an instrument for better work, with more productivity, more presence and more services.”
Now begins a new season of responsibility and transparency.
“It’s reformism,” Brunetta said.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Palais Chigi.
According to Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No employee resistance has been recorded, the Secretary-General assures: "This is a process shared by employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution."
During a conference at the Ecole Supérieure de l'Administration publique
In Rome, the minister said: “In three months, the absence of illness of public employees has decreased by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in a year.”
And he adds that it is essential to make it more effective, the Public Administration.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - these last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well beyond inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees came together to challenge the standards of the Brunetta decree using the Codacons.
"While the Minister of the Public Service is today spreading data on the decline of absenteeism in the workplace due to illness," writes the Consumers Association, "the people of the "active offenders" continue to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive public administration employees gathered to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in case of illness for reasons of service is contested; the extension of the hours of residence of the sick worker, during which the control visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, the Inail data confirmed that the white deaths were around 1,200.
Figures that show the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the leading causes of death, and cause almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic aspect, Anmil is celebrating today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday in October.
"The disturbing data released by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," said Giorgio Napolitano, President of the Republic, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association of Mutilators and Invalids.
The Head of State expresses his "sincere appreciation for the continued associative effort in favour of prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to victims' families and awareness raising of public opinion"
“Naturally outraged, everyone has hit the nail on the head to put an end to such tragedies that, by their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, even though the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the Speaker of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed how “this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions, to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly”.
The data from the accident at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive," said Anmil Pietro Mercandelli, president of the company.
"We do not want this 'rebate trend' to actually translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention relaxes, that tragedy comes.
“We believe that in general, we don’t do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions.”
"We believe that more checks and inspections are needed, as well as more intervention in the training of workers, and this, from school."
"There is still an effort to be made with regard to communication and raising public awareness.
"But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers must be given to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for the victims of the work" and the "derived assistance towards which the system has been oriented in recent years".
“The aim, therefore, is to give back to the worker the guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the one who has an accident should not depend on spontaneity or the enlargement of the legislator.”
Finger-pointed Mp3 player, they put hearing at risk.
Listening to full-volume music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a statement released in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the EU's newly identified and unexpected health risks (Csrseri), published today.
"From this scientific report - we read in the note - it turns out that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full volume music using portable musical devices, for more than one hour a day and a week, risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full-volume mobile phones can unwittingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to the scientific data," the EU official said, "it is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this domain information public.
We also need to re-examine existing control systems, given the scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow the new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"Scientists-concluding the EU executive confirm that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but the concern is growing as to the hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as reducing levels and the duration of exposure to noise.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, are now exceeding the current limits on the maximum permitted noise level in the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for extended periods of time are at risk of permanent loss of hearing ability after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Alemanno ordered the Commission to leave for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we end, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Thermes de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - wishes to emphasize Alemanno - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome which will be used by political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Communal Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the will to have a corner where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will have completed its tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a specific time duration.
In June-announce the Mayor- we will present the strategic plan from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital.”
For those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of daily life and emergencies that manifest themselves from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to see from the front, and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to emphasize that "this Commission is not a useless body nor a bureaucratic ensemble: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman cities, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences that express the capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, “it takes a draft of strategic reference, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking of its future now a unitary spirit.”
A future which, the Mayor of Rome says, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but which will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but "also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why.
A famous American politician who wants to become an independent, wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.”
“Obama is really fucked up: he believes he will win the highest office in a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!”
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously racial attacks, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have polls, which all state that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper in the southern U.S. has written an article: once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
This is where an aspect of the American mentality emerges, kept secret until the end.
“Say what you want, we’ll see ourselves putting the cross, on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed until now, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these reasoning, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: what were the mistakes Bush made during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home on foot to its buttocks.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush’s weakness.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debacle makes itself felt even among journalists: in the press, it's time for suppression, and many accuse the Internet, this "murderer" of newspaper paper.
Five hundred U.S. journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not say openly to the followers of the information, feeling less anxious about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on the assembly of newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we want traditional journalism as the general public understands it to be reduced accordingly.
An obvious but complex pessimism overwhelms American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Publication printed against broadcast.
Journalists don’t have a hard time seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are swindling a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as the "murderer" of the newspaper.
The “economic pressure” journalists feel is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to joining the technology hoping it “does something good” for their journalism.
Today, the biggest grip in American journalism lies between who runs the newsrooms—that is, the directors—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to the “safety of work”.
Directors who think they lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we go to 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a vast nation like the U.S., with 300 million residents and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for the holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in total, passed a certain number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often “diseased” during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STILL IN GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for housing in Rome.
. Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl Escalation Instruction.
During the trial in his office last week, he had obtained the release of the house transformed into a mandatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel from the provincial city to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already occurred a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion bailout plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving it.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms it to us by communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to the federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and to the financial world.
The soul, precisely, which made itself felt despotic with the vote I was speaking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been cited is just an example of the changes, of the great changes that the ongoing economic earthquake is already pre-announcing or letting go: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and may not only be here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena that have been hidden for some time, to such an extent that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-upgradation, the extraordinary re-launch, of the double category of sovereign state, in relation to some sort of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with the outside world, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost national here.
Political internationalisation really seems out of the question, or rather, it has little to say: the clear evidence is provided to us by the European Union, which, as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, fails to decide on any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and especially a credit condition: when we go through a difficult period, there are only states that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to get them back.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of inestimable value, elements that no market or international organization can ever have in a similar way.
This new emphasis on the nation-state crisis is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, indeed, while we were convinced that from now on we had entered the realm of the network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we always realized that we were only going to get back to the future.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth, but which are absolutely connected to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the misfortune of living in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now arrive at the second novelty which, however, foresees a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis appears to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow.
And moreover, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even disturbing: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
Thus the conviction of the various classes increases even more, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, of having the same time, and of being ever more alien to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, fed in a subterranean manner, a powerful and branched movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised "revolts" or, in the changes of collective moods of the latter, in the latter, in the latter, in the later
There is the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, it seems someone, are always more difficult, which does not date from today on, and therefore is able to understand and represent the deep economic strata of society.
In view of all this, talking about a current "mass rebellion" on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But let’s face it, keep your eyes wide open, that’s not without reason.
The super glue to walk on the walls.
Win the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centers, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded there.
With an adhesive barely measuring 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called nano carbon tubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a spaghetti stack,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that make it possible to ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it "detachs easily from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Engineering.
MARKER ON THE WALLS? – “This material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
Could be to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since nano carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
At the moment, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented an adhesive formed from microfibers like hair, which self-cleans dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medications: never with fruit juices.
Pay attention to grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in the summer because they are desalterant and rich in vitamins, so associated with certain vital drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing depending on the case, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether in boxes or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in progressing in Philadelphia, he throws a new juice alarm to the patient, sneezing at them, and sneezing at them.
Grapefruit juice has already been strongly criticized for being held responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-stamina and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
It is the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which had given the news in a newsletter dated two years, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mixture and to pay attention to what you drink, if you take the medicine for example.
According to the experts, even orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit the medicines, so it is not recommended to use them.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology at the Public University of Milan, said: “These findings are generally immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the information notes of the drugs.
It is always worth reading the illustrative papers of the medicines you are taking, and, if something is not clear, do not be impressed, but speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert told the Ansa news agency.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research into business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published in the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked many controversy, and was blamed on the economist for years, but which has now proved accurate.
"I'm surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, has disappeared from public attention," Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank's executive committee, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a very aggressive, particularly critical of the Bush administration's excesses of liberalism.
Open Office is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach ever more users, from home to office, professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a nearly one-year work by volunteer developers, overseen by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the revised interface and became less austere, to other more important ones, such as the standard version of the Mac OS X and the new OS X support.
Open Office paid particular attention to the interaction with the 2007 Office suite, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx,.xlsx,.pptx.)
Also interesting, some features specific to certain modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphics processing module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create "Hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe graphic with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts over modifications, in the drafting of texts, because each employee is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is in addition to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be shipped at home or at the workplace.
And if the theme of freedom can be a way to spread it in homes, it is precisely in business, that Open Office then tries the big challenge, already able to rely on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consulting and support service, ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the equivalent writing video of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for rival PowerPoint presentations; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graph.
The goal for 2008, to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, one can even exceed the expected figure.
Kohl also, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best climber's jersey.
It is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26, Kohl was the fourth positive cyclist at Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl's samples are part of those carried out in recent weeks, by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl’s positivity at the third-generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus shedding the best climber's pedestal jersey.
IMMIGRES: NEW YORK TIMES QUESTIONS IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as an emigrant country has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
The New York Times, which dedicated a long article discussing the topic of racism in Italy, began with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are both those where we record "more integration and more work", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the Northern League"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature wanted by the League to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of the clandestine, is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic emphasized this tendency: “Giorgio Napolitano, during his meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinal, called for the State and the Church to work together to defeat racism.”
Student victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for one room.
The student rental market is not in crisis
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the union of tenants, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding the whole categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin have to support," explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani.
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, no rent limit, sub-loans.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the revision of the tax, are necessary to calm prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from 650 euros minimum (Black Band area), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros is requested for a single, 450 for a double bed.
Values slightly lower (550 euros for a single one) for areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
You can save only if you move away in peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed, and 450 euros for a single in the Predestina area, Centocelle or the like.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, we spend from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, it is necessary to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the city economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rentals are often taken by extra-community students, there is a further anomaly: the rent requested from foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell to old Paradiso cinema, the cities eliminate the historical rooms.
The historic cinemas close in favor of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image provided by the director Giuseppe Tornatore illustrates what is happening in the great Italian urban centers, but also in the cities of the province,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of large multi-rooms, and the death of consumption of mono-rooms in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that we find inescapable and indisputable; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
It is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we have shared a bit of a path and so many emotions" observes the director of the premiere of the Nuovo cinéma Paradiso, the film that offers the film to Tornatore
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of merchants, mean everything: over the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and it is the rooms of the main cities that have paid the most: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine is in the lead with 82 cinemas single rooms lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian operation has developed irrationally," notes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room is closed in a city, these multiplexers are not necessarily available to all.
Not to mention the lack of deliberation of credit in favour of traders: the state's previous debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million per year.
Let us note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about these closures, decided to solve the situation thanks to the signing of a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the mono-room cinemas of historical centers and on the outskirts.
Among the planned regulations, there are measures of tax facilities for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking and in some parking lots.
"This is an initiative that I like," notes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example by putting in place other measures.
It is clear, however, that to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today’s audience is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Paradiso cinema" which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass in front of the Rialto, or the now closed Quirinal de Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so much shared emotions, I turn the other side to not see the blackboards with dust.
Links between politics and ‘drangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the Mayor’s choices to the interests of the Piromalli clan.”
The judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of the Calabria, the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The controls are also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his young son, a lawyer named after the boss, already convicted of association of mafia-type criminals, as well as paying 10 million euros.
“An affront to legal and moral regulations, and especially common sense,” the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed a willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
"Thus, the clan would have been allowed to officially enter the town halls, facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and direction of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also a lot of politicians who resist the pressure of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest."
The arrests this morning follow those of last July, after which the police announced they had decapitated the Piromalli clan.
As of the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always due to alleged contingencies between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of dissolution, had been appointed head of a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
He raised the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the deputy interior minister at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of handling everything for a political issue, but given the incarceration request signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even managed to request the A3 project change.
From the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PMs write, emerged "the willingness to marry the requirements of a businessman, representing a better-known group, close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When energy is born from waves, now the big ones launch.
This is an unmeasured deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and now the world’s largest energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources that colossals like Chevron have laid eyes on, and are now trying to get their hands on.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil declined, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give a great boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by offshore operating systems.
This amount would be twice as much as that produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides..
Colises at the attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, a real revolutionary step would have been said.
Two years from now, more and more candidates among these companies, always devoted to traditional energy, are betting on marine energy.
“Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies,” said a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant, the Wall Street Journal, and it assesses the possibilities of cooperating with us.
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a permit, which is intended by the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if one considers that exactly in Alaska, the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which traverse the path of energy coming from the sea, and the sums invested so far, although their details are not known, according to observers, an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology still in its infancy, on the part of the fact that marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small in size, and do not seem to create a major problem in the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the mud up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure rotates a turbine which, in turn, feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through cables under sea.
At the moment, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could serve a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a shopping center and a parking lot using six marine turbines of the East River of New York.
The movement of water during tides, rotates the turbine blades, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant has announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw on energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Research of Electric Energy, now deserves the potential of tides.
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
And it is precisely on tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, are looking toward the coasts, have invested $7 million in 2008 and are forecasting investments of up to 35 million in 2009.
