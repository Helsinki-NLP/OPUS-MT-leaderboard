A Republican Strategy to Oppose Obama's Re-election
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to fight election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by confirming that voter fraud in the U.S. is rarer than the number of people killed by lightning strikes.
By the way, in 10 years, Republicans’ lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the conduct of elections in individual states.
In this sense, the majority of U.S. governments have since 2009 promulgated new laws that make the registration or entry procedure more difficult.
This phenomenon has gained importance after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were able to be registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time limits for early voting, declare the right to be invalid to register as a voter on election day, and provide citizens with the right to vote for which a court act exists.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
The Republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states that force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible people, do not have a government-issued photo ID card issued by their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a designation.
However, you often have to pay more than a hundred dollars to get the required ID.
Young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with incomes of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are considered voters who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs to choose more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by those clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic voices.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, in 2011 Republican lawmakers in eight states sponsored laws that abolished voter registration on election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns for voter registration in the 2004 general election have helped to register approximately 10 million citizens.
As a result of the measures adopted since 2009, the share of registration of new voters in 2010 has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the time frame for early voting in the state.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of voters who had voted in advance were African-Americans, although they make up only 13% of the state’s voters.
The same goes for the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
By contrast, whites, representing 76% of voters, accounted for only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to enforce the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The democratic critics are striking at the partisan nature of the passed laws and see in them as a clear objective the influence of the results in the countries that decide for 2012.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that those states that have passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
The PSA test does in fact sometimes produce incorrect results, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a stronger hesitation of the already indecisive men for the conduct of early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We got the opinion of two doctors.
The studies conducted in the United States included numerous interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that after 12 years of follow-up, the probability of formation of metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 years if you have a direct relative who was already suffering from prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent also have a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must really understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated, if he does not affect the quality of life in the long run, and in these cases, one is more likely to become ill for an active overdose.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are offered active monitoring and they are offered treatment as the disease progresses.
Increasingly, the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not be.
That is why I still recommend conducting the test.
However, the most important thing is to talk to your doctor to determine whether or not it should be performed.
In collaboration with the International Society for Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that allows us to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite the advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting sick at him.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently.
“If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several of them remain unsolved.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It is very harmful to human health.
“Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
The Weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, uterine, gastrointestinal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,” he adds.
The diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of getting cancer of the groin or gastrointestinal tract.
Warts should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase rather than an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly shown.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu emphasises the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family predisposition.
"The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson Analyzes
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has sparked a bit of a stir last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model - our best or "at least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but empirically has not yet been observed.
But for physicists, it’s still not entirely certain that it’s really about the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still no data to be absolutely sure about it.
However, let’s assume that it’s actually the Higgs, since there seems to be only a small risk of being fooled, and let’s look at what it’s all about.
In this world, there is a necessarily inevitable law that causes two objects to not be present at the same time in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too hard as you will get hurt.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that for them there is also such a law: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state", and are in the same "great state", and in this "great state".
On the basis of this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner there are the good citizens, who are called Fermione, and follow the Pauli principle politely.
And in the other, the bosons, an evil band of anarchists to whom nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure, these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons that we will not treat here and the "power particles" through which the great forces of nature are spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
It must be emphasized here, however, that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle" that is the "bender" of electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" precisely at this location, in such a way as a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disruption" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
Stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" to show this boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the exciter must reach very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be feared by a very large rock.
That’s why a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is needed – the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! – to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold itself in the refrigerator.
And similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while others (like the photon by the way) do not have a mass.
What can all these researches be “good for,” asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, they serve to check the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists to accurately examine all the deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who most eagerly hope that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great flaws, since it does not provide an explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, no such deviations have been found at CERN so far.
Impacts
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way, in the early 1960s, laser pioneers in Bell Laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle – who worked in the Bell Labs where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first permanent laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962 – has already told us that the laser was initially regarded as a “laboratory.”
Imagine yourself...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround research.
For example, in 1969 Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves all digital cameras worldwide as an "eye" and has won him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
With its committee on "Death in Dignity", Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed soon, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that killed him had left him a two-year period.
“They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years,” he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in his home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
“However, it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for it,” he says.
The disease does its job: an immense weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he reluctantly resigns to help himself with the meal.
Bravely, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is to heal my diarrhea, because it’s humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
“In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is pink while standing,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois’ home.
Returning to the childhood stage is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
“It depends on the person’s ability to take a step back,” he notes.
In the opinion of several people working in palliative care, major events take place in the midst of these setbacks.
The patients who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who take care of them with so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die “consciously and through torture.”
But through the illness, I really got to know my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I have no more wishes in life,” she says, before accepting that you put on a mask that helps her breathe.
In the next few days, she still expects a final visit from her son, who comes from Italy.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers are offered body care and food intake assistance.
Palliative care is then used when there are no other options.
To make the dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, there is a bed for palliative care for 11,700 residents.
That is very little, given that one day we will all die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given oral care with brandy or Pepsi as desired.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning, his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help family members and patients alike,” says nursing director Nathalie Savard.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, one day is not like the other.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family gathering in the yard and is well supported by his pillows, as one approaches his honour, a 36-year-old man who has been surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, dies after being carried around by everything, according to his will.
“For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients admitted to the home of Victor-Gadbois come from their place of residence, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care that is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter has reached the end of their lives, either at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Montreal Society for Home Palliative Care, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in Quebec’s health care system that ensures that several doctors specializing in palliative care are careful to ignore the adoption of a law to regulate the death penalty and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation signed by prominent figures of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to declare their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to a high-quality palliative care before being accepted to switch to death support.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain without taking measures to relieve her.
I fear that the patients just want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst prognosis until the last day.
Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard’s chances of survival were already minimal when she discontinued a deplorable chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to cancel the treatment, she replied that she regretted giving up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die are grateful to the care staff that this desire has not occurred after their pain has been alleviated by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at Montreal’s home palliative care company, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
Thus, at the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which tends to put the patient to sleep either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer act as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviated, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “I want you to fall asleep,” but “I want my pain to be relieved.”
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals of large scale in Quebec
Officials of the street building office, companies of the construction industry, money-makers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso are intertwined.
An "industry" that was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s strange how the system has collapsed since drastic measures were taken,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
The scandal was uncovered by him as a result of an in-depth investigation into the unrest related to the road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then prime minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret funding of parties and bribery of officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010,” he stresses, “the Ministry of Transport alone had saved the contracts a billion dollars,” because some of them had their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, in the hope that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the police officers of the "Marteau Troupe", which since 2009 has caused Montreal's "canalization cartel" to proceed with the artificial lifting of contracts more restrictively...
In recent weeks, she has conducted numerous house searches and charged with fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received lubricants in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers of the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were expressly charged.
The latter has taken a keen interest in explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito played his hand everywhere, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the Liberals who were in power at the time.
He also claimed to have organized an illegal fund-raising for former Liberal Vice President Nathalie Normandeau.
Canalization contracts, the costs of which have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received from the construction company gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes in the amount of $736,000 in compensation for collating contracts.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they were lurking by artificially blowing up the bills with false additional benefits by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately looking over a shadow budget that filled his cash with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay stepped down in early November, causing Montreal to plunge into a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first MPs to strike the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, from 2010, she refused to sell a community property, which was purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
From the investigation, which is finally being carried out, she says that she "draws to a thread that allows her to understand the functioning of the ants-migrated system in order to stop the evil and to incite the culprits."
She says the procedure is “painful, but positive.”
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, however, need a unit of investigation designated only for Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but above all, he thinks about the role of "mandate bearers who are in the picture about the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting from a 70% stake in funding election campaigns in Quebec, he joked: “I was told that this was just a weak slump of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes to limit the donations to parties to $100, which would not change the situation, according to him: "As long as campaign spending is not strictly limited, black money in politics will be in circulation."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and financing parties: "We cannot go deeper; by going to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages Quebec's and Montreal's international reputation, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh to take a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you have adopted a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play on a daily basis.
In a game, this is even easier.
In football everything goes very fast.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings at the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress gradually.
They therefore take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new additions this summer are used to playing games at very high levels.
You also know that every training unit is crucial.
This means that a player like me has to offer a face and want to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti pays respect to all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as the top rider.
But we are in detention.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the eighth final in this way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have to speak out against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group before Porto, so that we can broadcast the replay of the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG gives itself the means to make this project take concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year, we are really excited to announce this title.
Last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed as we were strong enough to bear the victory.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, you should be a master with 79 points.
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are around the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it’s normal that a lot of us are expected.
We accept this completely.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0 and you still find something you can accuse us of, that is certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what people are still waiting for.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to create a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we have shown strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has been unable to qualify for the eight finals for two seasons, and which has also made huge expenses!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to be at the game break with a 15 point lead!
This meant that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were “boosted” by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell ourselves that we have won them in the end despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much so that we talk about a "Zlatan dependency".
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has made it clear that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was in my heart to take part in this event.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from hitting out some game time.
I've seen things out there that I've come out of.
Today I managed to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since I was baptized with the “blue”.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must set an exemplary course.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, stands close to the players and encourages them to win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is this a start-up game (1:1) forced in Spain on October 16th?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone is committed to everyone else.
Prior to this meeting in Spain, I had never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin, it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties involved.
In addition, as is often the case with these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the belief that the current monetary system, shaped by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros, etc.) as well as a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousands of websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin reached a peak of $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, it fell to $2 five months later, before recovering to around $10 today (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as “the virtual currency with the greatest success”, “competition with the dollar or euro” and “similar to the traditional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” that are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy through gaming (and sometimes even exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, each time the trade is controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously custodians of the ledger, examiners, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data associated with this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the public account book distributed throughout the network.
The crucial step is to include this new transaction in this book.
This is done via a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a fragment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and distinct electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay with the same money twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) for fraud, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains unconnected, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be shared up to a hundred million, which leaves a certain amount of space...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement of the computing power.
The life of the network has already had highs and lows.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who just introduced Paymium, which is a real-money payment company and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse to donate this type.
They are accepted by others such as the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the bill and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a “mega-completion sale” was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are thus cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with the dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend to be seen in which hierarchical systems are covered in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
“It’s going to take some time for Bitcoin to get through, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he forecasts.
By the way, in its report, the ECB plans to reassess the various risks that are considered high today in the event of a success of this currency.
We have withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory, and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We have punished Afghan farmers in particular by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the wounded and wounded.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as in the Soviet era.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base at Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed by French loans, was properly carried out.
The truck and tank convoy overrun by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more influx of the Taliban into Kabul.
Since its irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was overrun by war due to the struggles of the various rebel groups.
Their takeover at the time was seen as a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a shared desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war came to power again in 2001.
They have turned into business owners by seizing government properties to sell them as a construction site to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive U.S. subcontracting.
They have been indicted, and most of them were not involved in the fighting themselves.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who were able to take advantage of the American allocations: the flight of capital is considerable.
The young people are fed up with the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is viewed everywhere.
There is an army now.
Will the authorities under whose command they will stand be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already working to restore the militias in the province that will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from some decentralization on the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of prime minister, which has existed since the 1964 constitution, the United States wanted to make it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karza<0xC3><0xAF> does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country that has been waging war for 30 years, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
It has been rumored that Afghanistan has huge land prices.
This further reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground to take possession of it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mines of Mes Aynak, let the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) make their excavations at the huge Buddhist site and remain the province’s most important employers.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to resume normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and boys' gymnasiums, Institute of French at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was set up in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages, and has been able to provide assistance to and encourage those affected by a small French non-governmental organization.
These works, which required numerous local workers, have been able to help suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the increase of agricultural land use.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural projects from municipalities in Kapisa province.
In order for the farmers to free themselves from the revolt led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their wish, it would be necessary for them to carry on in their favour with less, well-controlled and directly concerned civil aid.
A Constitution with the Breaker's Rod in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt, with regard to the declaration of the Constitution, which temporarily grants it unlimited power, remains more than ever divided, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To everyone’s surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just one week ago, the head of state granted this plenum two additional months for the completion of his work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has relied on a provisional, multiple-changed text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his “autocratic delirium” by continuing to “break his word” and “the right comes with its feet”.
On the side of its proponents, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the brothers to abandon their plan to explain to the Egyptians the text section by section.
For the president, it is also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is raging across the country.
According to confirmations in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolent.
In particular, the Egyptian people, with this backlash, will be given an ultimatum to an overriding vote: "You either agree with my draft or I retain the unlimited power of authority", the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals did not comply with the call.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they turned away because they felt that they had not been able to enforce their views.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted in the same way.
In order to reach the decision-making capacity, 11 persons, deputy members, were added in all haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were usually unanimously adopted.
By the way, the commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... in the time for prayer came to be expressed, as some members of the committee were of the opinion that the pendulum of the Constituent Assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention, finally remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made stricter application possible.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
“Sinfulness” is the response of the Liberals, who only see this as a propaganda blow.
They believe that the Islamicization of the Constitution is based on other articles.
They have in particular Article 220 in mind, which recognises an advisory function of the University of Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is alarming because “the people who are called upon to make an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy here."
The fears of the Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university should be far less moderate than the current one.
“There is currently no concrete religious commitment to be recognized.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema, but academics who have been partly trained in the French system", explains Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he concedes, "that there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, Am. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized for the far-reaching powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military's wishes, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations have demanded to defend human rights.
The latter also share their fears about the text, which they see as a threat to freedom.
The existence of blasphemy will be maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression of opinion, especially for the press.
Furthermore, there is no longer any article on the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will march up on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy sites, the navel of the world and a sea of sunshine
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
To bow before the holy places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It means that all who bathe in this river will receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding feast, the walking on the water, the setting of the lake storm and the catch of fish.
This is where Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the temples are located in Jerusalem.
Here believers follow the path of suffering or the way of the cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, in the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree grew from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the holiest place of the Jews - the walls of the prosecution, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave cards with wishes, which then go into fulfillment.
Take a trip to the heights
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 AD.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at an altitude of 450 meters above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else brings an air cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, in which it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the mountain top.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
With just one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be allowed a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are preserved ancient qumran manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea found in rock caves in the Jewish Desert, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There is a collection of works by Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the Museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are generally refused.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most striking department is the monument for the children, which was built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, there is complete darkness.
The stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and of the countries where they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for your health
The three main recreation areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
At each of the three locations there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Amazingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21 <0xC2><0xB0>C and the air warms up to 23 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise-blue water has a high salt content and thus even carries non-swimming smoothly on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is undescribedly beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt solstice) and healing mud as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and for the calming of stressed nerves.
Touching the secrets of old age
These secrets lie in the old city of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous Seaway, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia were connected.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to wander through the narrow streets named after the star sign.
Fortuna is supposed to be the legend after all who touch the walls in the street with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newlywed couples from all over Israel and even other countries on photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can wander through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman rulers, including Pontius Pilate.
Today evening concerts and operas are performed in the carefully restored theatre.
Brand list for tourists
If you drive to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is preferred not in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be exchanged into tokens (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 tokens).
In the city you usually get on the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a high-speed tram and in Haifa the only subway line of the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper city.
To be precise, it is an underground cable car.
A ride within the city costs, regardless of the means of transport, 6 shekels, which is enough including a changeover for a ride of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport is quiet.
And on Sunday morning the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without shells and foods that contain both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you have a choice between different dishes with ham and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of peppered beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this, there are many well-bred cats that roam the streets comfortably and inexorably.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
Cats like busy places and don’t say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shillings per day.
Admission tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shillings.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreational seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the 2010 comparison period, before the lifting of the visa requirement on February 9, 2011.
‘The Great and Powerful’ Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While MPs and civil rights activists discuss the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with forged certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your only goal is to make money for the maintenance of the families that remain in the home.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which every migrant must take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
Until now, this scheme only applies to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing industry and in retail.
However, the tests are expected to become mandatory for all guest workers in the future, according to the Federal Migration Agency.
Not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be proven for both the retention and extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Also excluded from this Act are persons who have received their training certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problem and protection of rights
The entire examination centres will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of People’s Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Citizens’ rights activists, on the other hand, asked the following question several times before the law entered into force in the press: What does the whole thing really bring?
What changes does the rule to have to show language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
In particular, contrary to the Migration Agency's spokesman, it is a matter of reducing the number of forced laborers.
“Many are now talking about protecting the rights of working migrants,” says Viktor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan.
However, your rights must be protected before they leave.
Only an organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical evaluation are facing problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who put him under the pretense of help in a dark, narrow barracks where he will endure with dozens of his equal months without food and documents and will be created 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have received many complaints from our migrants.
“In the home you will be promised the One, and upon arrival you will be deceived, get their passports taken off and not receive the promised salary,” confirms the head of the labor migration administration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't be shy, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they can hardly express themselves in writing, not only in the language of the target country.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: few Turkmens, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a reasonable basic education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As a teenager, these children immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
“It’s difficult without language skills,” they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
The following important aspects of the law are highlighted by civil rights advocates.
Only migrants with legal status must take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers continue to remain illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Prohibited access for unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are for the most part forged and we are not registered, and this then results in cases of blackmail.
“They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea,” the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow told reporters.
"Don't waste any money on fake papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be forged.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive this for nothing: every migrant who hoped to save himself thus the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice the cost of the official test: it costs one migrant three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased, both officials and civil servants agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will receive time for a language basic course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered positions in areas where no active understanding with people is necessary.
Home Ministry Ignores Illegal Arms Market
The share of legal weapons in crimes is extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning to tighten the gun law for private gun owners.
In response, the authorities responded to the latest events: Injured in shootings at weddings, as well as seven dead in the seizure of Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to ban the use of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be tabled soon.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "drawing the screws".
On the Internet, an open letter was published, whose author – representatives of various arms associations – is urging the authorities to distance themselves from “senseless intensifications.”
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, the criminal justice official, Vasily Lesnikov, told the BBC’s Russian service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes using registered weapons were committed over the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals from using themselves on the black market.
At present, according to the authors, in Moscow you can find any weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons reach the black market via several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts gun orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” Baranez said.
On the second channel there are illegal weapons, which are stolen by law-enforcement guards from criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons that were stolen from both the police’s weapons chambers and directly from employees of law enforcement agencies.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
Explosions have often occurred in many military camps.
“There is evidence that in some cases it was a fire foundation to cover up the lack of weapons,” said the former military official.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
“Today, there are countless private arms factories that do not stand up to international competition, and that is why the weapons are hand in hand on the black market, for example in Moscow,” the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
In particular, many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a separate, sometimes artisanal production, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling,” explains the former military official.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated what proportion each of the five channels has in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on the topic of weapons.
According to investigators, the majority of illegal weapons come from the army and the law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market were there because of the “guilty of responsible people who have come to grips with weapons in their work,” the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% go back to theft in weapons production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at a gun shop who does not want to be named assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long since been bought by no one since they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more common for traders to obtain the supply in a weapons warehouse.
A gun, for example a TT-type pistol, is purchased via a fan rack.
The weapon is issued and handed over through the fence.
“The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines,” he says.
“The police, of course, are aware of everything and therefore, if they are unable to comply with the plan to detect crimes, periodically conduct checks on dealers offering illegal weapons,” the sales adviser added.
"Like in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers most often find each other over acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested to come to the station "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me to take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
I learned the price of the gun only there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
“To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts,” says the sales consultant. “I have such a friend, but I don’t trust him.”
There are dealers in the markets, but there you have to go and meet a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who arranges that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I am currently even getting to some beatrings over a friend I trust.
He also gives me the hammer rings just because he knows I'm not squeezing him.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military associate Viktor Baranez attempted to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the patterns did not change.
He received a photo album in which "everything possible" was depicted.
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” recalls the military family member.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I not only buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target disc.
“I can then shoot there, and if I’m convinced that the gun has a good shot, we’ll negotiate with each other,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
There will be no need for any papers or any personal meetings.
“You only need the right amount of money,” it says in the ad on the website “Buy guns or rifles”.
There, users place your orders and make inquiries.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without license", asks user "Iwan" (verbal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has recently switched on countless websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons are stepping up to the service.
People come like hungry fish while feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to scoop coal
Military commentator and former military associate Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible parties accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a ATM machine.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," said Dmitry Kislow, spokesman for the non-profit organization Pravo na oryzhie.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can also go empty and get behind bars when placing a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service has recently switched on countless websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons are stepping up to the service.
“People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in the Siberian labor camp and are allowed to shovel coal,” he says.
A Makarow for $100
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices from $100 to $900 are to be expected.
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of the type Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by mid-range inspectors.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of offences involving illegal weapons throughout Russia declined by 7% to 22.9 thousand between January and October 2011, while the number of cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices dropped by 7 percent.
Fast Food and Supermarket Workers Strike in the U.S.
One in four U.S. youths ever sit behind the box of Mc Donald's
In recent days there have been massive protests across the U.S. against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to escalate or whether they will soon be aired again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly organized by trade unions.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, which saw sales in the U.S. attracting millions of customers, sometimes leading to handshakes.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, laid down branches of the chain, whose target group are people of low and middle income.
Walmart sells all its products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in Walmart stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many of the low-paid Walmart employees only buy in their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about severe working conditions, such as missing fork stackers or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests on Black Friday called for wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the company’s own health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California Berkeley prove that if the company increased the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than they're now donating for pay.
If Walmart were to fully implement the wage increases to the customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
For them, this would be a year-on-year increase of only $12.39.
Supporters of Walmart are pleased to note that there were only nine federal states to protest and these did not provide the company with any losses.
The Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during this period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, Walmart cashiers executed nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-wing Huffington Post's website that "less than five" Walmart employees had dropped the job and the protest was just "an additional PR trick" of the union organizing the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York City, where their target was not Walmart stores (which are not wanted in this advanced city and are therefore non-existent) but McDonald's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald’s says the company sells billions of servings, and yet you are not granted sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 an hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too high, and on average, their simple staff in New York City get $8.90 an hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get out of New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. teenagers after school stood at McDonald’s behind the counter, but the teenagers still lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with employees of McDonald’s, I’m constantly meeting people who complain that they get paid and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the Wall Street Journal, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current average.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
U.S. law forbids corporate governance to stand in the way of this goal and discourage or fire union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff fluctuation.
Unsatisfactory
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of McDonald's on Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sold billions of portions, and yet you're not getting paid sick days!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that “we should support the fast-food employees together so they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!”
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, of which by far not all are employed in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain can only be moderately over-listed"
The theme of augmented reality, popular with fans of modern technologies, has recently been perceived for the most part by the lens of a special spectacle.
Google first presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
However, in a conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses for the company’s scientists were only a passing station.
It stimulates the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and create virtual spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely stuck in the phase in which pixels are worked on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to anticipate 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What do we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much still plays out on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system gets more data) could be improved, the output so far has not been decisive.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We must release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment is detected.
Then we could complement the real world much more easily with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these ugly virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She is popular, but isn’t she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform everyone about its actions and intentions.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the field of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and short, rather than exhausting gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a wristband that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gestures and language.
- How's that?
- For example, would we ask you to give us this can?
They say it and point to it at the same time.
- Normally, I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new sensor types that allow us to capture reactions from people more accurately.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What requirements do you make based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this way, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
It is necessary to take into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of the human being are extremely dynamic and openly said, the current 30 fps, especially for gestures, are too little.
In our Redmond laboratory, Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with a adjustable processing delay of between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed just such a device, only without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might be able to solve the problem.
Or amplify the problem, as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to determine how that helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that in terms of applying the technology of augmented reality in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it's not pleasant to always keep a smartphone in the hands on the go, but I think the most amazing option would be a "changing" augmented reality, where we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and that is their strength (privates can only see you), but at the same time also their weakness, because an augmented reality by means of glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only available to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point to: There is no tangible reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often speak of the fact that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection substrate.
It takes pressure excellently true!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "pictures in the air" some hand-holding, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is currently still as weak as someone breathed over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist, which affect the nerve applications in the fingers, also this is a potential direction.
- Did you try to outsmart the brain?
Does it make you think it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task with which we will have to fight for a long time, namely to let a person who is physically in a closed room believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in fitness studios).
So far, the brain is only moderately overlisted, and many years of work remain ahead of us.
This is exactly what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so appealing to a researcher: we are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde", which is dedicated to urban residents who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
High-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the city’s borders and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia, have already landed on the chosen list.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed bear, who is sometimes seen at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at stage meetings or on vernissages.
Wherever Kirill Miller’s paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg socio-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright figure of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and, through his presence on the street, enchants his fellow citizens with a smile on their face and provides them with a good mood.
Recently, he caught a swirl and became a Petersburg swirl player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer, which deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the grain norm causes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to a conversation.
- When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Cultural Palace of Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I knew I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I made friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazon Wall"; from this "Puschkinskaya 10" was created, and then it was only once finished.
I am drawn to theatre, to fashion, to music, to everything except literature.
- And all of this came together in your art clinic... - It was important to me to be at the center of the St. Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should come together.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and until the renovation work there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemian, the house of the Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how cord came there with his project "Ucho Van Gogh".
Snur and his friends sang simple songs for the play-back, wore tight jerseys and included today’s acclaimed composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play live, it became out of its "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but the basics he learned from us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have their origin in the art clinic.
There our staff and regular guests went there.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press about the award "Persons of our City".
I won in the category "Artist of the Year", and with it I had reached the climax.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Nowadays it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unrecognizable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares to be like that.
In a clown, it erases everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let’s save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress fully.
Now everyone is paying attention to the clothes and is oriented on the outside and not on the inside of the person.
But perhaps one should not give a man a hand, but should spit in his face.
The deception disappears by the disguise.
We recently saw you in the role of the city's turntable, a cultural city that should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful too?
- Nowadays, commercial art has to be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the collapse of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro communities, and it’s hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're going to like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- The performances of Stas Mikhailov come but several thousand!
- Women who are abandoned come to him, where the sexual and social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything goes to the bottom.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy what was achieved.
In my youth, I painted such paintings that were even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionov at a collector.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of my career.
These days, there are often misunderstandings.
It means: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that’s something completely different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's missing from Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say they are servants of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real czars, it was different, because the czars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are currently good advisors in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some that the experts might be, but they are blocked off the road, as it requires higher-ranking experts who evaluate the first ones correctly and clear the way for them.
Now it only counts its own taste.
The same goes for the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding nutrient base.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural nutrition ground, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that’s not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, this is much less.
Art must again be modern, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the City of Saint Petersburg
Birth in Space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer steroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth dwellers on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question is how can we continue to grow in gravity or on the replacement planet?
In my opinion, there are not many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
“Namely Mars and Venus,” says the scientist at the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, the surface of Venus has a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus, that is, in space.
The question of replanting in space was first addressed by the researchers with regard to the flora.
Already half a century ago, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of orchids bred in orbit did not differ in the slightest from the terrestrial species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, watchdogs were sent into space to explore how gravity affects the development of embryos.
A very normal chicken is developing.
But then the problem begins.
“The problem is that the chicken has to stop; it has to be able to stand on its legs and begin to move,” explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems, RAN.
Without solid ground, the chicks swarmed wildly.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely faded away.
The chickens did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Two times we let chickens hatch and then set the whole thing up, because it's simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychew to the failed experiment with the chickens in space.
The last cattle cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, only similar species will be found on the biosatellite "bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
“This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to continue,” notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats got young.
The problem of reproduction directly in space could not be solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are removed from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, humans can do it in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our mosses flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the following question: Is it beyond space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
“Finally, no one answered this question,” says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her spaceflight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even performed work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
However, there remains a risk.
We only have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy young people.
“The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying in orbit,” concludes Cosmonaut Valeri Poljakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, and artificial gravitation.
The hydro lab at the cosmonaut preparation center is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a floating state, the cosmonauts gain routine for working in open space.
The water is the gravity.
Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but babies feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders bear witness that life in the land descended from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the mother’s belly in fruit water, and the fact that it can then get used to water more easily.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to the first swim just once every 2 weeks pass.
“It’s too little time to forget something,” says baby swim teacher Marina Aksenowa.
So while for a newborn child, weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of heaviness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles form back enormously quickly and thus also decreases the ability to squeeze out the child.
Well, let's deal with that by birth-initiating aids.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze out the child.
"But what happens then?" is the non-significant question of Valeri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the Earth’s pull, the organism cannot form the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a load suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is of elementary importance to his life.
“This experiment, which we do together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to create a disabled, a completely unadjusted person,” says the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space is a mere theory.
At some point, however, it becomes a reality when the inhabitants of the Earth break up in their spaceships into a distant planet that becomes the home for their all-born offspring.
NK<0xC3><0x9A> Chief: Control of the black system fails due to political debt
In the context of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good supervisory authorities and adequate laws, but falls behind in their application.
In the conversation f<0xC3><0xBC>r Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz says this of the Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office (NK<0xC3><0x9A>), Miloslav Kala.
“A law is never perfect, but it has to be applied properly – and I don’t think that’s the case with us,” Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German inspectors.
As a negative practice example, he cites the appointment of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now banned or allowed?
“A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the chairman of the government, and the supervisory board, whose duty now is to control compliance with the law, interferes with its activity,” notes Kala.
At the meeting of the Committee of Auditors of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared with each other.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel examination that we started about two years ago.
To put it simply, it is the European legislation that determines how public contracts are to be handled, on which the national legislations are built up, and finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all this with each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we were able to find extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws in our country may even be a little "stricter and more perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more precise rules over and over again; it is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results for you from this project?
It is precisely this kind of joint control that could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect the laws and reduce and austere thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economicity means buying a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even so that we burden the system in this way only with excessive "paper crease", and those who are looking for gaps in the system have much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Act of Incorporation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NK<0xC3><0x9A>, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NK<0xC3><0x9A> of the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar in structure to ours and also has a college which is formed only slightly differently, but in principle both authorities work in a similar way.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. that there are these accounting courts also in the individual federal states - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH is only allowed to control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the national accounting courts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would rather not compare this without specific information, but Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, but one cannot say for certain that Germany is better in everything.
Is it possible that the testers are better there?
That is not certain, but as I said: I do not like such comparisons very much.
It should also be noted that those countries that are an example to us also have problems to deal with.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have anything to do with our authority, would they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what was the significance of the renewal of the award law for your authority, do you feel any impact?
Given that this novelle is only in force for a short period of time, it has not yet worked out in our exams.
Since our checks are subsequently carried out, we have to expect a certain delay here.
We are more likely to experience effects in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control tool "Recognition of risks of uneconomicality" and with it almost 14,000 public procurements are tested and analyzed - here the changes will naturally be affected by changes, as the thresholds will change.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positively, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be observed.
Under the previous rules, it is already the responsibility of the persons subject to an examination to the holder (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to ensure that any non-compliance with the award law with a violation of budgetary discipline is the same.
Does it make sense to make the law even more stringent?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system simply puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
First of all, let’s say which path is not the right one.
The Prime Minister recently said that the SDGs would not deal with controls of the so-called "black system" - what does that mean exactly?
Is the black system now banned or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the head of government, and the supervisory authority, whose duty now is to control compliance with the law, interferes with its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we're doing it like it was nothing.
The award law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the provider with the best offer is excluded only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it has to be applied correctly – and that is what I think is missing from us.
There are individual ice creams on the roads, but they are mostly dry.
On the streets of the Czech Republic there are partly snow and ice flats.
However, the roads are mostly well driveable, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the roads were well runable this morning, with snow and ice flats in place.
Temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 <0xC2><0xB0>C, during the day it should be slightly warmer.
In the region it no longer snows, and in the lower elevations there is only a thin snow cover.
However, there is about 30 cm of snow on the combs of the Erzgebirge.
According to the district road guard, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 motorway and the first class roadways in the region are currently unrestrictedly accessible.
However, attention is paid, for example, to bridges on which the roadways are sometimes required and smooth.
All traffic routes of the second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, there remain sectionally required or extended snow remains.
Increased attention is therefore required, in particular in the higher layers.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové
On some roads in East Bohemia there is a danger due to ice flats, in higher layers and in the mountains there is a layer of snow sometimes on the roads, the road and highway direction on their internet pages.
The road championships warn drivers of ice levels, which can occur especially in higher levels in the Pardubice district.
It is possible to reach ice flats especially on traffic routes of the second and third class in the districts Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy and Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to.
The I/43 and I/34 roads at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is particularly found on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické Mountains.
An extended layer of snow lies in highlands on the streets of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov districts.
In East Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or warmer, and it remains largely free of precipitation.
Temperatures range from -3 to +1 <0xC2><0xB0>C, with a weak wind blowing.
Pilsen District
The roads in the Pilsen district are now well runable, but local attention is required, and the way of driving is to adapt to the weather.
This is freezing in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures subsequently dropped, it can get to ice flats on the roads.
Local is also to be expected with fog, but the sight will improve in the course of the day.
This information comes from the district road masters.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, but the road championships recommend that you drive between the 80th and 131st kilometres.
The roads of the first class are mostly dry, but frozen.
However, in the south of the Pilsen and Tachov circles, ice flats can be found.
The roadways of the second and third road classes are wet, and therefore also here the reference to possible required sections applies.
Drivers should be especially careful on the less frequented roads in the area of B<0xC3><0xB6>hmerwald.
Olomouc District
With snow mat, drivers who are heading towards the altitudes in the Olomouc district have to count today.
After the use of scatter vehicles, snow mat remains on the Pass <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo as well as on the road in the direction of Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
Nightly snow driving forced the road masters to use, in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk fell about 3 cm of new snow, according to the road administration.
In the rest of the district, the motorways are usually unrestricted.
"In the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk district, snow remains remain in the highlands.
On the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo pass, the drivers have to count towards Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k with snow mat," an employee of the road administration <0xC5><0xA0>umperk told the agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
Her colleagues in the Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k district also had to go out at night, according to her, the streets are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are unrestricted, but in the <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk district, the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as here the roads are still wet.
Bezirk <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, Bezirk Liberec
In Northern Bohemia, the road championships report several poorly-drivable sections of the road.
In addition to several places with snow or ice flats, the mountain road from Telnice to Kninice in the district of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> n.K. is closed, according to the traffic police.
Temperatures are also below zero, so snow and ice will remain on the roads. However, no problems have been reported from the deep plains, especially south-east of the Bohemian Central Mountains, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disruptions have been reported so far.
Ice cream is reported in particular from the area of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported from the main routes as well as from road I/13 at the border of the districts <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> n.L. and Liberec.
The blocking of the road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice was necessary due to branches pressed from the snow load to the highway.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think will happen in less than a month’s time?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people are so happy to get to.
With our band The Tap Tap, we’re more fun about it and say we’re the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world’s downfall.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you give our readers a closer look at the project?
This is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of which is forecast for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00.
The end of the concerts is expected to be about the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone about 12 hours ahead of us.
Who is this idea coming from?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
In doing so, we not only want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the world’s downfall, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once handed this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and key pendants against the end of the world, with which the purchase via www.e-tap.cz can also support us people.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other performers, has also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world with the title "The end of the world falls out".
Even today the anthem on YouTube is very popular. Will it also sound on the benefit concerts?
Of course, and to the very end, provided that everything works out and the end of the world does not take place...
The anthem is to be sung simultaneously by all performers at all three concerts.
In addition, the anthems will be broadcast live on Czech television in a live broadcast.
The text of the anthem comes from Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and have fun.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education center Studeo, where we have been working together with the association Tap at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the readers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, a separate building will be created, in which we will then proceed with this project.
There are several groups and performers at each concert.
According to what criteria did you choose them?
We wanted to put together a program that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> perform.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" also planned for the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally – if we are already in the US – would like to associate this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not exactly small, so far you have appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it appears at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. wheelchairs need to be transported in the luggage compartment. Of course, we also need to carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, so far it has always worked without problems, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes wondered in part already.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with freedom of barrier, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were just in Russia witnessing that in the East everything is still in its beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not suitable for the disabled, and it is still unusual for someone in the wheelchair to be alone in the city centre.
It is not even obvious there that a wheelchair driver is left, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are also clubs that are trying to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect do we have to pick up against the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we hang behind...
It should be noted, however, that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not uncommon for a larger group of disabled people to be actively involved in social events there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in the public and freedom of the barrier is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come out of our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years: What motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a supervisor at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intensive.
And since I am a musician myself and playing saxophone, among other things, I founded a music AG together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>, tends to say, something gets out of control (laughs).
But the band has only been known in the last few years, or am I wrong?
It’s true that collaboration with well-known singers has helped us; in addition, we have also started to actively promote for us.
We have become aware that if you do something and you can’t see it from the outside, your own performance doesn’t exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good readers, high-quality devices and so on.
Was it your goal to get it that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that you can approach things differently.
In today’s show business, they often copy each other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is carefully considered and accepted only after a long time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare claim that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression that the audience usually has is, of course, compassion; that is only natural.
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full-fledged life if they have the means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, this is not only progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise on many things and you must also call for a certain discipline.
This, in my opinion, is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they then find that they have two rehearsals a week, have to complete preparatory stages and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm disappears quickly with many.
This is how it works everywhere, in any band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them have been involved since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xB0>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop that.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place on the day before the forecasted world event, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9 p.m.
Venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are connected to each other via live circuit and a common interpretation of the anthem "World Intercourse Falls Out" by the band The Tap Tap sounds.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipping of a multifunctional disability education centre, which is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute in Prague.
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in pre-sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency, making it the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The journey of Poland into space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish space enthusiasts engaged in space travel, thus not always coming to terms with it.
I recall, for example, the lecture by A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the REP Hirsch prize, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch, for "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and spaceflight.
In Polish journals he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski’s world-renowned contribution to the development of space travel was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the Earth-facing side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway draisin was built in Poland, for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not yet clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or to brake the draisine.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-propelled guns.
The research was conducted by the Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the submitted documents, it is evident that the research was advanced to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then freely interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the specialist press published the design of a photoelectric hunting rocket by Ing. Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpedoa powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work his work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on spaceflight appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Agency (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautzycky) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company takes place in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles on space travel are devoted.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space society.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was to be expected that space exploration would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish Space Agency (PTA) attempted to join the International Federation for Spaceflight, founded in 1951, and in fact, the PTA became a regular member already in the fall of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became deputy chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh as much as 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 began flight tests with the two-stage RM-2 rocket in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>d<0xC3><0xB3>w Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high winds.
However, in 1962 the further development was discontinued.
The first rocket of the RM type was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed from this rocket, which differ in size from each other in the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport capacity of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight altitude for all three types was 37 km.
From 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Institute of Aviation, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which was followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos program, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Remek.
The repeal of the Law on Non-Profits is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the law on non-profit works.
This decision raised a lively debate in the public eye.
It is certainly interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberalised economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with relentless financial speculations.
Due to the large differences in the value of labor (wage) there are price tensions.
Under this concept is to be understood a condition in which the manufacturer attempts to prevail in economic competition through the import of advantageous goods by "inviting" the competition, thereby tearing a larger market share into itself and increasing its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies moving their production abroad or shopping there cheaply, or giving up their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, state expenditures necessarily increase.
This situation is further exacerbated by the fact that employers are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates in the individual economies a situation in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thereby attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own people to private capital without regard to the social consequences.
This is reflected, in particular, in changes to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the own population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, in particular in the wage area.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and, on the other hand, by the reduction of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, for several years now, there have been public food rations for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases in which workers receive such low wages that the state has to raise their income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of auxiliaries employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU southern countries will undoubtedly end up in the same state in which people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level, or that they will be forced to work and invest in private wages on the margins of society.
The question is, of course, where does this capital come from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or Africa, the workers work for a fraction of the European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to the extreme that the state is not allowed to participate with capital in its own economy, and that planning economics leads to economic disaster.
Private capital insists strongly on its position that the state should not interfere with the economy.
Then one has to wonder whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual benefit, a legislation in which practically everything is punishable, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a Ministry of State mandates private law firms, which are closely intertwined with the industry, to draft legislation.
These bills will then be passed in the Bundestag.
All violence is then no longer based on the people, as the Western constitutions declare, but on strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, liberal democracies are now quickly entering a situation, as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey': "The state had long been in decay, and the offices were filled with violence.
Against lubricants, by unlawful simplification of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew unhindered, and the people went to the election with already bought votes" ... "people with character do not compete for office, so that the state did not have a consul for eight months as a result of this downfall" ... "The people were really starting to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult manor was
As it turns out, today’s society, as in ancient times, is based on the ruthless preference of one’s own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital, by its very nature, is not able to recognize and enforce the advantage for the whole society.
The result, now and then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who do not at all strive for deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the rise of fascism and communism in the ruthless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's point of view, the downfall of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain break, which already marks the next round.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that the elites of today are completely ignorant of the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes of which we are already witnesses today, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the past and recent history.
The repeal of the Law on Non-Profits is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push the social level of the population down.
This trend is therefore system-related.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the state’s capital participation in the economy, increase citizens’ influence on the government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Labor des Chaos.
"...that nothing arises out of violence, or could ever arise" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain is: "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are" .
“If my sons didn’t want a war, there wouldn’t be any,” says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a myriad of reactions.
One stands behind Israel and argues with its right to self-defence while calling the Palestinians terrorists; the other in turn supports the Palestinians, argues with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and describes Israel as a state of terror.
I do not want to write here about who in these ever-repeating waves of guilt killing and who is the victim; in the end, today’s residents of Israel, including the self-government areas, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence themselves.
I am about to open to the readers the view behind the scenes, the view of whom the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of land in the Middle East are especially useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and come from my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether someone was behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out a particular one that could be called the head of the Kraken (I don't know if anyone else is standing over them, but I don't exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschilds as early as the 1990s to prevent the connection of their name with high-crime acts, in the background of which always stood the consolidation of their power, the increase of their wealth or anything.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they are waging wars or equipping themselves with them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Gaddafi only remained in the Russian Federation).
Whoever tried to confront this family had to pay for it with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began issuing his own (state) bank notes during the Civil War, and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed – he was assassinated in 1963; MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
The Rothschilds’ global power struggles led to the formulation of a plan to defuse three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first universal war was intended to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, by means of the second war the colonial rule of Great Britain in particular should be broken, and the third war should not reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people as a whole (such a surplus would not be enough for their surpluses), and so much of their surplus would not be enough for their surpluses.
The method by which the group of the richest families work with the Rothschilds at the forefront is the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offering of a solution (or from chaos – order out of chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, so that crises like the ones triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they succeeded in triggering World War I by the murder of the Habsburg Crown Prince Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Tsarist Empire by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Tsarist Empire, the war was no longer necessary), followed by the dissolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to make it easier for the Second World War, the bankers, through politics, had to create a latent conflict situation by occupying Germany with gigantic reparations of war; by doing so, they established the condition of the impoverished masses, so that they had to settle with the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader, they had to boast about it.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the precondition for the mass immigration of Jews into Palestine; there were first clashes with the settled Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler got rid of the chain where the international bankers initially held him, or whether everything went according to plan, it is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the world Jewish state.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as prepared by the war reparations against Germany the ground for World War II, the exclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will become a victim in the front line of the Second World War, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think about how sharply the people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with at the beginning the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as among us, the people, exclusively choose their own candidates.
Only the current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, could be a typical example of a fascist aggressor, the international bankers loyally controlled, who is doing everything to defuse a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia) could come from...
In what light does the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: “The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.”
In her conception, the new world order is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocracy.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip at birth in order to subject this being to total control.
And it makes the little and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves all give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their forehead that no one can buy or sell, for he has the mark, namely the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom: he that hath understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: When It's Worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the fallen Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had guarded the patronage of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. government, there was no positive way out of this situation – it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have massively damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent failure of the violent attempt to free the hostages only made everything worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been brokered by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages brought home a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six embassy workers managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees out of Iran; helping them hide their true identity – they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film staff who allegedly filmed in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan, developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also made Hollywood's collaboration necessary.
To make the cover credible, articles about this film project appeared in professional magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have long been kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Husar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence are shown iconic contemporary photographs, and even in the film version of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which are ironically and slightly overrated therefore come.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the office floor, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has achieved a remarkable start to his career with this film.
From a smiling actor he has become a respectable director, and even as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the Crimi No Child's Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without Grace (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck’s first film, which does not play in the director’s home Boston.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place was one of the hallmarks of this director’s previous films from Standard Hollywood.
Affleck, however, also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the incoming sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet still conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story takes place.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his team in fictional scenes (the wrong film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story actually does not offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But with the few, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality a little bit - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is diverted from a phone call in America, or even the pursuit on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its all-too-wide spread, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters would have earned more space, and thus they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film thus loses a bit of traction, a film that can be followed with a certain interest, while tasting the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 70s.
However, it only arouses enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history alive to this day, and as proof of how the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence agencies are covered, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for blowing up balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipopaltky.com, which annually issues a survey of the most absurd bank charges, has decided this year to hold the contest "Absurdest regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
“This idea was inspired by the EU’s recent plan to introduce a 40% women’s quota in the management of large European companies,” said Patrik Nacher, who looks after the organisation of this survey, to the Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo newspaper.
For example, the European Court of Justice’s judgment on the standardisation of insurance rates for men and women is one of the nominative absurdities.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage when it comes to life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
“Further incredible insights from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
The controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the mandatory addition of bioethanol to fuels that are consequently harmful to nature, and the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contained a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or even the guidelines on how to use it.
In the past, criticism has also caught up with the actual ban on the use of the term "butterburst" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides, under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks even with a veto threat).
Lobbying interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have "circulation abnormalities".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that they only harmonise the non-uniform national standards that would hinder trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries with the indication that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the last year’s EU regulation, which, according to balloon sales, must be provided with the indication that children under the age of eight are not allowed to blow up the balloon without adult supervision.
The EU has called for an American study that, according to balloons, is the leading cause of the death of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children under 14 years of age when using annual market straws.
Curious Incidents There are also at Home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns European officials themselves – anyone who takes an official role in the EU, because of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, must not use the name Macedonia and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com server, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, also nominated the EU regulation on the extent of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU thus established the high volume of food supplies that could be located in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our EU accession.
The Czech Republic then, for example, exceeded the set volume for mushroom preserves, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or the idea of providing funding for applications for funding.
These ideas did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
“We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will ask for a refund from the EU,” declared the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest was very high and the state stocks were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, according to Palas, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us.
Finally, the European Commission came to the Czech Republic to the extent that it organised a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funds for applications for funding were offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), specifically the funds for the submission of funding applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations in the Member States are easily the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to ensure the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union deserve, in the opinion of some experts, more recognition.
A more serious problem, in the opinion of these experts, is rather the EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced by individual Member States in the budgetary negotiations.
Emotions also point to the fact that, like other Member States in Brussels, the Czech Republic has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky" after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Inlanderrum (Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename it "Tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
The term rum may only be used for sugar cane distillate products, not for sugar cane products.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, in the company of the world famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, L<0xC3><0xBC>becker Marzipan or Parma ham, there are now also the Karlsbader Zwieback, Carpfen from Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88>, or the Saazer hops.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer bread cake or the Ho<0xC5><0x99>icer rolls can be used.
“People want me to save the Republic, but I’m just an amateur,” Okamura says.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or president.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the Republic being plundered for 20 years, how thieves walk around freely, while people are being raised taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But if I see something that I don’t like, then I try to propose a solution to change it.
And since I'm over 40, and I'm independent and impartial, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate you succeeded and then immediately made your way to the castle.
Don’t they turn their backs on their voters?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to take up the fight for the castle after the Senate election.
Later, I clarified this and said that I will run for the office of President if I am elected to the Senate.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and as strong a mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people in the pub and in front of the TV, gossip, but knock down anyone who wants to change something.
To this comes the media, who want to rob one of the honours, and who confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
About me, for example, it was claimed that I would bribe journalists or that I was an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
The fight around the castle has been taken up with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive statements of assets of more than 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change the laws.
As president, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring in legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have been committed to ensuring that the travel guide remains a free trade, and this could be implemented.
The problem is the petty politics – if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, he is deliberately rejected, and that only keeps the population.
As an independent party leader, I have far greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without the thoughts of the drawers and party agendas of any party.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather to the right or to the left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are more likely to see me on the left.
For me, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
It is important to me that we continue.
I don’t care if someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support every good solution approach, even if it comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the ODS, and I will also turn to bad ideas.
You miss it when someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that's what you want to get close to.
You can call this populism for me, but all the proposals I have talked about already work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without the support of Parliament, you will only have keywords.
In the long run, you will not get far in politics.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing material and criminal liability?
I don't have a choice.
Politicians, journalists, and the public are convinced and trying to bring them to our side in order to achieve these goals.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to ask the Presidents of the parliamentary parties live on television to legally anchor the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And then the people who spoke might have to say why they refuse to do so.
A strong personality that points to abuses can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my program.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn’t work out, I go back to the private sector in six years.
This sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a rescuer.
I know that I alone do not achieve anything; that is why I have talked to several well-known personalities about whether they also want to run for the Senate.
For example, I spoke with Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, who, however, refused because of overwork.
In addition, I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1>, who discovered the fraud in trading light heating oil.
I started my candidacy on the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I’m not sure anymore.
Sixty percent of eligible voters have not gone to the polls at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a composition of the Senate that changes will only be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district chiefs.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to review the past of any potential party member, and I don’t even have the money for it.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign; my transparent account is only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You are talking about property claims, what do you look like?
My private assets are estimated at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another one for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>kodu Superb worth about one million, and then I have a few more million on my account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a childhood dream - James Bond always liked the way he drove in the car, was gallant about women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Should I make a debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn’t arouse too much interest.
And I am not obligated to contest the campaign by my own means.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn’t live by myself, so I couldn’t fund my son, for example, the English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So, do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going to retire from these activities?
But this is not related to the amount of the salary.
As promised, I have partially withdrawn my activities.
For example, in spring my deputy will be the managing director of the travel agency.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live by something.
What monthly income did you get used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is still the case.
However, as President, I would completely suspend my activities.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the mind - on the example of Spijkenisse and the newly built B<0xC3><0xBC>cherberg - 2 photos
“I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there’s something interesting to see again,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large-scale company, thinks: "But, it's already beautiful, the house."
But I wonder what we still need a library for today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one is going to volunteer in one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy little town in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is a remarkable record holder.
The 80,000 inhabitants community has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this silly situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to reconstruct the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro signs as beautifully padded concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the master of statistics: a library had to be created!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam Architecture Office MVRDV, master of the cool bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with usual ease and appeared for the competition-hearing anno 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin.
And while the jury was still looking around and squeezing with the axes, the Frequent Maas stacked his chosen companion cell the size of a pyramid and ended his action-oriented speech with the words: "Dear City Council!"
So this is my proposal for the Book Mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million expensive mountain is shaken up.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjoining residential and semi-detached houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the B<0xC3><0xBC>cherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project has been nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
As a result, the faceless small town square, which to date no longer had to offer as a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unfathomable ugly town hall, behind whose white fa<0xC3><0xA7>ades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory in order to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: Book Eldorado under cheese bell.
There is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, but the true spatial and reading delights open up as the topography climbs on foot.
The glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lanterns speak unambiguously the language of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You already have a look at park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally, the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle lies a large, dark space that is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We put the classic room configuration on the head and stepped the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the B<0xC3><0xBC>cherberg is cleverly used: offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technology center are located in the center.
A special delight is the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall cladding, sometimes chesting, sometimes stair railings.
Optics, haptics and smell are foreign.
Even fleshed-out architects and construction engineers shake their heads, whether the unknown building material.
“We wanted to work with recycling materials here,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so, in a Frisian farm one day, we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, a millimeter-thin plastic fleece has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a root substrate.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts two seasons, after which it is ripe for the waste.
For the library, for the first time in these quantities, the fleece was pressed to four centimetres thick plates.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is dyed into a dark, homogeneous, load-resistant material that smells like new cars and sports shoes.
After 105 steps, we reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500-meter-long hike, you will be rewarded not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and stuffed ficus trees.
They provide for the atmosphere, but above all for the proper humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
“You wouldn’t believe it, but this house, despite the many glass surfaces, is a showcase project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled with earth heat.
Although the B<0xC3><0xBC>cherberg is under a glass storm, the sun itself appears only briefly inside on sunny days.
The wide wooden adhesives, which stand across to the glass facade, serve as shading and capture much of the sun's radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest are done by fully automatic rolls.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was also there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even called the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "long overdue soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal inventory.
Thus, for the first time, the optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept is up.
The shelves are filled to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a half-bigger library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for the glory.
With this, MVRDV has succeeded in that royal discipline, which is called the Fachjargon Identity Foundation.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
She may also be so young and uneducated.
This is, after all, an approach to identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany voted in favour of the inclusion of Palestine in the vote.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin is thus balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the request for observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
Then there was Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Germany, however, must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also voted in favour of setting up a no-fly zone.
This was finally implemented by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is currently transforming its foreign policy, away from a policy, so to speak, managed by the United States, towards a German foreign policy.
What is more difficult is that the Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still playing their part, but they are on their way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy as they have France or Great Britain.
What does a “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be prudent not to confront the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That certainly plays a role.
But I wouldn’t want to put too much weight on it either, that’s not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German reflections.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by including itself in important voting decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have a certain amount of respect for it.
Because it does signal that it must be taken seriously as an international player and his interests must be considered.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly spoken out for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think the government under Obama in secret probably has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so keen on Netanyahu’s politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can’t be part of a wider line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
This is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
It has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany itself consider itself to be an important international player - does Germany want to take on a leading role at all?
Or is Germany still taking the lead?
Germany is not yet used to it, this is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a bigger role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes on a bigger role, various anti-German feelings are released.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
That’s actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be receptive to a wide range of neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the United States in European politics is continuously declining, but the EU is filling this vacuum at the moment, but who else will stay there?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's uncomfortable for them and makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind it lies a name officially registered in China, which, however, has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
However, it enjoys protection for as long as the actual namesakes do not complain.
Even then, it is not clear if they are right.
“It’s getting harder and harder for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s law firm specializing in far-reaching protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The copywriters already have a few additional letters so they can sign up for their brands.
Thus, from Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company there protected the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and in infringing intellectual property.
In the big cities, there are multi-storey department stores that almost exclusively sell counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: on behalf of his clients, he contends that Chinese companies are officially entitled to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This is what women are meant to be fishing for rich men.
The Chinese government is not aware of any guilt.
“It’s business-damaging, you have to fight it,” Pattloch says.
"The brand is being watered down, the setting alone disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failures and the process costs of the industries concerned go into the millions, especially in the case of expensive display products.
According to market research firm CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros a year, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into the money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can proceed, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court rejected complaints because after the long period of time the offending name has become a "market reality".
If the plaintiff is in trouble, he would even have to pay the plagiarist money because he violated his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star to this day.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against replicators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the trademark office CTMO in Beijing admits that there were shortages in 2010 due to low staffing and room equipment.
Last year, however, we were back to normal from the "notice situation in the work process".
Thus, the stock of unprocessed opposition procedures has decreased by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 objections are still pending in the office.
Dealing with it costs a lot
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row, China is leading the list of new notifications around the world.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan had been charged.
Simply put, each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, it costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Although the Germans were able to reach that its illegal manufacture of imitated car parts was lifted.
However, the replicator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We have failed to do so ourselves, as family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trade mark office CTMO also rejected the objections of the Munichers.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the process opponent continues to fight until today.
You have to take care of hell
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archive had even had to go through a hundred-year-old file to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the counterpart a "high six-digit euro amount" for the settlement.
“You can see how much we’re worth,” says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East threaten to even repatriate to Europe.
In other words, if there are unprotected brands there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This field of business has long been abandoned by the Group, yet it was able to reverse the registration.
“You have to take good care of yourself,” says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, foreigners should “register everything that is somehow worth protecting even in China,” says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact: If Freudenberg was subject to the last act of his brand drama, then one would probably have to pay the opposite side license fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the relevant segment.
World Aids Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi tries - and in Swaziland, Aidswaisen is happy about it.
The history of a connection that far exceeds 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers looking for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then only the voices of the singers slowly swell - Alt, Bass, Tenor and Soprano - oppress, harass and pursue each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his mellow wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi is trying a new song.
The fifty singers have come to us, between the ages of 23 and 69, from the human geneticist to the housekeeper.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text and this one also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Worldwide, there are around 34 million HIV-infected people, which is estimated by Unaids, the United Nations AIDS Programme.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 people living with AIDS.
More than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the Voices for Africa Association has found patents in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take over a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the gogo center.
Imbongi stands for Zulu storyteller or also praiser.
The Bantu language can speak fluently in this room, but no one can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language, bringing them back from time to time to where they originally came: to the south of Africa.
For 8,733 kilometers of the air line from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are infected with the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, what all of Swaziland is ill with is the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
Cuts in the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus in themselves, with a median of thirty dying is no rarity.
During a joint Africa trip in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the imbonis saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school, there is no chance in a poor country.
In the beginning, it was still the private commitment of the individual to send a child to school for a few euros a year and allow him a warm meal a day.
But already a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since taken care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally.
Facts about Sexually Transmittable Infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Felt lice and crusts belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and Tripper occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of every five reported syphilis cases in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (chicken), tripper and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV is comparatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - yet: around 20 percent of HIV new infections are absent from this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur much more frequently than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country, human papillomaviruses are also common among young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are required to be reported.
The number of syphilis infections has more than doubled, according to the Robert Koch Institute, from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints during urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
Because in part, pathogens from sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricating infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid late follow-up.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the gorges that the choir sings in all of Germany, a lot comes together.
“In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, the club’s chairman.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well accommodated, with one of the grandmothers, for example.
The gogos, as the old women on Zulu are called, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have included up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms appear on time for schooling every day.
Who has no one else, comes to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club just as much as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have an HIV test.
This is not self-evident, because the disease is so obvious all over the country, one prefers to keep them dead.
A king with 14 wives
“Aids is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There are free condoms on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flesh to flesh."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels through southern Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of compassion, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness, many of which still know on the southern tip of the black continent from the era of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already shed a few tears for some grim border soldiers.
The trip always takes you to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their duck children.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is more than known.
“Go to Esitjeni, there is the light,” people say.
And if you return the 8733 km air line to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the rehearsal room at Bergheimer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, then you can see it shining.
NASA Discovers Ice on Mercury <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cap may be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, as evidenced by three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cap in the planet’s permanently shadowed region.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly even asteroids that have been struck on Mercury.
No one is bringing the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth’s citizens are probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: Small gecko holes in infinite distances.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This image of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: The oldest stars are to be recognized as blue dots, harder to identify are the pink "newborns" in the star cluster.
This star-forming region – dubbed unromantic by scientists W5 – has discovered the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This shimmering glow of a dying star has captured NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The Donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star sheds out in the process of dying.
In the huge trifid nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope shot this photo of the galactic birthbed.
The Pleiadian constellation, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
Like a red age, the Helix nebula looks at the viewer in this infrared photo.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent brought this nebula the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular coloring.
This baby star, in its full beauty, could only be captured by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.

One of the biggest and sharpest shots of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on coloration, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the trifid nebula several thousand light-years away in the constellation of Sch<0xC3><0xBC>tze.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (triangulated, triangulated), since dark dust strips divide the glowing heart of the star’s birthplace.
Astronomers have photographed the forebears of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are racing against each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
To whom technical abbreviations do not lie, he may call them by their nickname Southern Fire Wheel.
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows an excerpt from the iris nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The nebula, 1400 light-years away, consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was combined from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, captured the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars on our Milky Way.
The star weight always produces new youngsters.
This star-cloud, connected to the Rosetta nebula, also continually brings out new baby stars - 5000 light-years away from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was not until shortly after the crash that hydrogen was found predominantly in the universe.
Our Insights into the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 – even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have grown ever larger – and the insights they provide are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into the sky directly over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the economical design: The telescope is fixed at its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an altitude angle.
Its peculiarity: the high light-gathering power.
In fact, despite a comparatively small mirror diameter, this extends to those of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to the All after extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Astronomical Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which honors his name.
With its total of four mirrors, the remote tube can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the ESO Observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror is supposed to comprise 42 meters - and is composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
Pictures, however, are to be expected in early 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which looks into the sky next to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope will be created - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
The most important impressions from the universe, however, are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets - mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planetary candidates had been identified since the mission began.
The final preparations for the launch are documented in the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched on board an Ariane5 rocket in early 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the crash.
Scientists assume that it also exists on the south pole of the Mercury ice.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the Messengers circle the planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on the Mercury.
With the Messenger probe launched in 2004, the first to orbit the Mercury, the scientists are now certain.
Drinking butter every day - and getting 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for clues in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for clues in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is called wild-romantic.
The minibus rumbles across the curve-rich road, past densely forested hills, rippling rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you were in the black forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talys, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Assyrian and is very durable.
The final station is Lerik.
The little town boasts too much Soviet-era architecture, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the arrival of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours, because the road is only one lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilatea Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the thing for tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Contest in May – and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world,” says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the life of about eight dozen talysses from the area is documented, which older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, another child was born.
However, the museum’s controversial star is Sheepskin Shirali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov, who is supposed to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in the face of the oldest documented person, who turned 122 years old, M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," Fatulayeva explains.
The husband had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he is said to have given birth to another daughter.
So did Shirali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov settle for a few decades at his age?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, a senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the high-rises in Central Asia.
“Obviously many high-ranking people also exist in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia, there are extremely many very old men living.”
However, due to the lack of documentation, there is no scientific evidence to support the age, especially since there was a lack of staff registers.
Cups of melted butter every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik are strikingly often reaching a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why do so many high-rises live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysses.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is on the diet.
But the fact that the calorie-rich diet of talysses is supposed to be so healthy, that they love meat, bread and especially dairy products, and many of them drink a glass of melted butter daily, does not seem particularly plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a buttercup, which she rolls back and forth tirelessly.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayev’s sons and a daughter, both of whom are long-grandparents.
Two small children also jump around.
In the kitchen guests are served tea, which is served in the typical, abdominal-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly lined up and glued, under her hood she hides long, dark-blonde braids that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never left me out and kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” says Mirzayeva.
Monthly Retirement Allows for Life
She has always only eaten what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
For the rest of my life, I didn’t buy any food at the grocery store.
Then she tells about her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the post-World War II era.
But everything got better when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, which ruled its country like a dictator, knows hardly any borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan’s elders.
230 Manat (about the same amount in Euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount from which one can live well.
And perhaps even Mirzayev’s long-time grayed-out son is right: “The elderly enjoy respect in our culture.”
They live in the middle of the big family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If there is no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival announcements in Cairo reveal the deep divide of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as its basis is strongly disputed.
The Egyptian president did not spare with pathos.
We have to make the transition.
“And that he succeeds is my responsibility, to the people and to God,” he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because all of them, so far hopelessly divided into a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a god-state on the Nile of graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He, said Mohammed Mursi, almost apologizing, temporarily cut off the constitutional court’s powers and extended his powers “to save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer who holds a Ph.D. from the American University of Southern California really wants to save is what the Egyptians are about, the world is not quite clear.
Should the judicial system be abolished?
In fact, the 234 articles, which have been bitten by the Islamist-dominated 100-member constitutional assembly in a nightly, 15-hour parforcerit, are in part alarming.
As in previous constitutions, it is also stated in the draft that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This has been and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the vague formulation and the associated legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This puts at least one new article close to it: In all matters relating to Sharia law, the Al-Ashar University must be drawn together, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great radiative force throughout Sunni Islam.
That doesn’t have to be, but it can mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which would de facto lead to the dissolution of the judiciary.
Much in the draft constitution is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: the civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress opposition figures.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, as it stands in the draft, "protect the true essence of the Egyptian family" "and promote their morals and values".
This is legally so vaguely worded that state institutions with the help of this article could even control the content of film art and literature.
In the plain text, this means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly states the equality of men and women.
For this purpose, another prohibits insulting or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Similarly, dubios encourages the formulation that the “insulting of people” is prohibited.
Is there a cartoon of the president or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
It is a matter of interpretation, as so much in the draft that Mursi is present for signature, and according to his words "very soon" the Egyptians will be presented for the referendum.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the Islamists’ supremacy.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual arrangement on Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring the charter down before it can enter into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution belongs “to the garbage heap of history.”
Through Twitter, he accused supporters of Mursis of wanting to lead a “Putsch against Democracy”.
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," opposition leader Jasser Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been sucked," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
“The Qur’an is our constitution.”
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, was a counter-demonstration, but cautiously not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile River in front of Cairo University.
Many disguised women and supporters of the Salafists took part in it and shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded from Mursi, "Clean up the land!" and they said, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the supremacy over the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything began, would probably have raised civil war-like conditions.
This obviously did not want to risk Mursis supporters.
The Muslim brothers stated that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had spoken out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box which direction the country should go.
A majority of the Islamists are considered safe.
“The word ‘human rights’ does not even exist.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which should actually go until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers while they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
“And now the word ‘human rights’ is not even in the new constitution,” he laments in conversation with the “world on Sunday.”
Mursi's extension of power to all three of the state's violence allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic game rules and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto puts them out of power,” Saeda laments.
But without civil society organizations, a democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, which considers the ideological direction struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It could be revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns, "You are giving birth to a monster you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most evil fish in the world?
Norway’s five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living – not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have anything to do with the local appetite for quite evil fish?
We take a selection of overripe cheese varieties.
You place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And leave them there for a week.
One has to imagine the nose-deepening smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s great delicacies.
I am located in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn smell in the air that just does not want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a salt-stained trout that is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how stinky you like your fish.
When in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really very cutting-edge specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire department, but also organizes the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk-General".
Around us, people consume small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
“Man likes the Aquavit more than the Rakfish,” says Havard.
The spirit can suppress the smell.
I cost a few bucks.
If you avoid bringing the rakfisk close to your nose, it’s not bad – like sushi, which has a fairly long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling possibilities and fish were soaked in airtight saltwater barrels in the fall.
In the deepest winter it was then taken out after long fermentation and - undoubtedly with the help of alcohol dampened senses - consumed.
Even a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and mostly emigrated to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who not too long ago was far richer than Norway, streamed immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - an essential, though strictly fragrant part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the most expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t often succeed in the world press, and most people don’t seem to mind that.
Here one still hates to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist right-wing extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "July 22 incident".
Norwegians find it hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, Norway’s main source of wealth has been the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason why we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round tablets with mature Rakfish and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and stinging blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a cautious people.
Your English is just as flawless as most people here.
We're not very greedy, we don't like gossip.
Norway has dealt with its oil wealth very carefully – a large part of the industry’s revenues will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, everyone was throwing around with money that they didn’t even own, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
“As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"And of course Rakfish eat," she adds with an uncomplicated laugh.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - I have enough of Rakfisk.
Such an Elch burger is definitely something different, the juicy meat is killing me.
But in the evening, the stinkefish is on the menu again.
The hotel I’m staying at is one of several venues that organize a Rakfish dinner where guests can vote for the best – or perhaps the most challenging – fish.
There is a live TV connection to a showmaster dressed in fly, who is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"How many points do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You're screaming and laughing.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But maybe it’s the harsh darkness of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces tough start
As Mexico’s future president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his inauguration, Will Grant of the BBC analyzes the challenges ahead for him and the mixed feelings of his people.
At the moment, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is a city that is always hidden, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, blocking several important traffic routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to disturb commuters on the way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president Enrique Pena Nieto will retain the presidency and take over the leadership of the nation.
He is faced with a complex task.
Under Felipe Calderons, Mexico has proved economically successful, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
“My government is strongly committed to reducing violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal.
Prior to joining the U.S. president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions about the new head of state are shared.
A Direct Man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute it to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and which represents a great improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques with their name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We expect real and lasting changes from him,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the party Pena Nietos, which works at PRI.
In particular, with regard to security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The allegations of opposition, the new president, lack substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway transfers and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a crucial urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was turned on to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
The bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone on a patch of brackish land near a large landfill in the last two years.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico – a statistic that even surpasses that of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murder of innocent women.
The critics of Pena Nieto believe that he did not address the problem of women’s murder properly during his term in office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete construction, typical of the defunct quarter, Irinea Buendia struggles with the tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her life partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed as if her body had been washed,” recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the bodyguard had already been deployed.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall and is attached to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But this one, the family said, has been denied until now.
The authorities treated me as if I were a spokeswoman, a disgruntled nurse, a nurse.
You want to just accept their judgment and keep your mouth shut.
“But that’s not possible if there were so many form errors and failures,” she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the presidency on Saturday, he will also assume a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been embroiled in violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term in office.
"I hope as president he is what he was like as governor," said PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is precisely what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Attorney General Says Bradley Manning Hasn't Complained About Abuse
Attorney General Bradley Manning's allegations that he had been abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks to dismiss the charge due to too harsh conditions of detention
The U.S. Army's Liberator is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents
The U.S. Attorney’s Office on Friday tried to find out that Army libertarian Bradley Manning – accused of disclosing the largest confidential information in U.S. history – missed several occasions to complain about the mistreatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
At a cross-examination of Mannings during a pre-trial hearing in Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that documents on weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month detention period in Quantico, Virginia showed no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a request by the defense to reject the charge – Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh prison term – Manning had said he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fine and Manning went through the forms that officials had filled out after their meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he had sat under heightened conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fine asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the facility as "very professional" overall.
The forms, so fine, did not contain complaints about mistreatment, although the officials had asked Manning directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally, and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they should deal with them, but they had not been recorded.
"They wrote (after discussing the concerns) "No problems", and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he had mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during this meeting was to have his observation status scaled down to "prevent injuries".
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status - which is one level under the threat of suicide - to his and the protection of others.
“I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and get rid of the observational status to prevent injuries ... in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Naval Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had become unconscious because of the heat.
Not being able to know what happened to him or the outside world has been stressful.
"My world was shrinking at Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell—at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours—and without society.
They only allowed him a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because during the day it was forbidden to sleep or even just lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and the guards could no longer see his face, they woke him up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned an accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners during an early morning count.
Manning had stated that during this count he never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket.
On Friday, Manning stated that he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should have dropped the blanket with which he could have covered himself, but admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had stated that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, and had previously tried to show an official that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used his underpants or flip-flops to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experiences and drastically reduce his detention should he be sentenced in his trial before the military court, which is set for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to lesser crimes, while other charges, which are considered too extreme, are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecutor's office is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the provisions that apply to all prisoners detained under the highest security arrangements in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the enemy’s favor, the unlawful publication of classified information on the Internet, the transmission of national defense information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty at all charges, he is threatened with a life sentence.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants — they call them hard times in memory, he says
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when unrest broke out in me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of whom I should go to.
I grew up in Central California and was called “Mexican” all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - exactly as my friends in Boston call themselves "Irene" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I decided to go for "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for abbreviations or dashes.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I’m not going to let go of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the snake for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues that were expected when the heads of these two countries met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. She is a reason why Mexicans today are as likely to stay in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico’s war against the drug cartel, even though he did not mention any details about it.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States fell into Mexico in 1848 and the country’s leadership under a premeditated gun forced them to leave more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be missed.
So once a U.S. government official has even the slightest criticism of Mexico, you hear complaints - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - about how Americans are oppressing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the path of war.
And yet, Mexico’s biggest challenge lies in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about Resentments?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person—perhaps a parent or grandparent—was not offered a chance in Mexico and migrated northwards.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is theirs.
Not Mexico.
And while we may now live the American dream, attend good schools and get good jobs, we must never lose sight of it being the American dream we live — not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have left.
And then we wouldn’t see ourselves trapped behind the curtain of silk now – with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that tensions exist between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are – and Mexican Americans take this to mean it to them.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they belong neither to one country nor to the other.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education bourgeoisie want to resume their connections to the diaspora.
They want to employ Mexican Americans as temporary “messengers” for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Now.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans are bragging about how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such a hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual indictments, countless buildings were laid in rubble and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed – and for the first time rockets from Gaza near Israel’s Tel Aviv metropolis and the holy city of Jerusalem have been struck.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these riots.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly pact situation could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems to be anything but appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened the hardliners on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though its grouping itself had to record major losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip have been trapped in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a re-emerging regional power once considered Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken over the Hamas party – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that around Israel is an Islamist half-moon – from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist stance could face the fall of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allied the king.
And especially the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt – the most populous and most important Arab country by far – on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region sustainably.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that itself cannot be pushed out of Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, make a contrary conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has proved itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more calmly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is firmly in its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide bombers - not least thanks to the blockades that have been carried out in the West Bank and thus in the main part of any Palestinian state, they are still being smuggled into the country.
His Likud party has allied itself with an even more militant group, under Avigdor Lieberman, ahead of the January 22 elections.
Why do even these backward Palestinians hesitate and leave them a state of their own?
If they actually had control over the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets just like their opponents in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish them, they should dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to get through, but the Arab Spring could make them a line through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with local superpowers will hardly help the new Arab governments in the restoration of their economy.
The fact that pragmatic President Mursi is teaming up with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign – and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think longer-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking bold steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination – a powder constitution that will undoubtedly one day explode in the Israeli-occupied areas, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only intensify.
Bloody missions to repel Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand its diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is one that is represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: Two states in which Israel leaves for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop arms deliveries in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the upcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama also has to play his part in moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term in office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House it seems as if he is also inclined to take part.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a strong interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform packaging of cigarettes enter into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging laws have entered into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive green covers, which are also printed with drastic images, which are sick body parts and sick children with cigarette smoke.
With the exception of the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names printed in identical, small print is from next Saturday.
As a result, Australia is introducing the world’s strictest tobacco packaging regulations.
The Australian federal government wants to rid young people of smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government is starting studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at 26 are not likely to start with a 99% chance after that.
“You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message of trying to promote tobacco companies with their brand image,” says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a slight impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law.
So it was said, with the laws, black market trade would be favoured, which leads to cheaper and easier-to-access cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have curtailed their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for cigarette case and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging has increased tremendously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan's Anuf Gebertze au Tobacco with their two
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale businesses and is waiting for new stocks.
This is a good business for us.
According to experts, the hack is in the popularity of social media with exactly the population group to which the plan is aimed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, prohibiting them from acting as sports sponsors, and force most retailers to stop putting cigarettes out of business. Now the tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Those who market tobacco and only have a small area left to advertise their products don’t get around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience reports on brands written by “normal people.”
You have to ask yourself: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that they even record a video for it – or does a marketing agency have anything to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry instead of marketing is focusing on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to fight the new regulations – those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, even though none of the countries are engaged in greater trade with Australia.
An WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to issue photographic warnings in 2001.
In the meantime, these have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
A lot of Australian smokers are very shy.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
“You just take a tip and put the box away,” says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box, on which a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the "King of the Pack" tobacco trade in downtown Sydney, says uniform packaging has made it harder to fill his shelves.
“I used to take an hour to sort out a delivery, now I need four,” Yu says.
"The government should have simply banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said to ourselves okay, that was, we're going to close," he added visibly offered.
In a constantly electrified world, it’s nice to be bored sometimes.
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane crashed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another pilot.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts of boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty nerve-wracking – even when books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it’s okay for us – and our children – to occasionally be bored.
Thus, the brain is forced to lose itself in interesting thought processes, which may encourage creativity.
And because most of us these days almost constantly stare at one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see this.
“In fact, boredom has a very long history,” he says.
The walls of Pompeii adorn a Latin graffiti of boredom, dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom can be defined as the experience of wanting to "exercise a satisfying activity, but not being able to".
Apathy is therefore different from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
Apathy, on the other hand, is not an urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, exists in a "disruption of the attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time is only passing slowly".
Being bored can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two states might be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re boring, even if we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in German, for example: "The Inactive Mind: The Definition of Procrastination from the Point of Attention", which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", a scholar points to Professor Eastwood and his colleague
Some groups listened to a loud TV show from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content; others listened to it at low volume, so it was hardly noticeable, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who took the barely audible television reported feeling more boredom than the other two groups — they had trouble concentrating, couldn’t find a reason for it, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult or stressful task, the distraction can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you do a monotonous activity - "just like searching for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that heresy and riddles, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even combat them by keeping people physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to wander around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point — my late flight, a buzzing loudspeaker, a particularly exhausting movie.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scale to long-term susceptibility".
On the scale are statements such as "many things I have to do are repeated and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida – particularly regarding the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty strained bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adults were bored in school and doing homework, while 23% said they would be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said they felt bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know if the percentages in terms of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is confident that “youth will feel particularly boring,” mainly because children and teenagers don’t have much influence on their daily lives.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it leads to people taking extreme physical risks and dropping the gambling or drugs to relieve them - this has been shown by studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors are investigating the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
“With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do best.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
But television can provide short-term feelings of happiness, but these are fleeting in the long-term.
So if you give your bored child an iPad, it can take it away from boredom, but it has not learned to entertain or control itself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: “Self-control transfers itself from one situation to another.”
The child not only learns to entertain himself, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
We should also not see them too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant activity and technology boom.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“It sounds like we have to be bored more often, but boredom is the patient, unceasing desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
He believes that people in truth are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated, it’s hard to get busy once the noise is gone.”
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new Marijuana Act
19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco is facing a lawsuit in southeast Colorado that will soon be legal in this state: possession of a few marijuana blocks and a pipe with which he smoked it.
According to Orozco, he and a few friends were traveling by car in Lamar near the border to Kansas on a September day when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was charged with possession of drugs and drug equipment - cavaliers' offenses, each of which are endowed with a $100 penalty - and received a court order.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for its own use, the answer in hundreds of smaller drug cases depends less on the law than the location.
Hundreds of illegalities revolving around marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer prosecute adults over 21 for small-scale possession, which will be permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
But state attorneys in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced they will continue to pursue existing marijuana offenses and are still citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their communities.
“This situation is progressing so fast that I don’t even know what will happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police at Aurora, located east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington state are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of drugs – and have a deadline before 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is at least ahead of most states in terms of marijuana regulation, where the drug was legalized first for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well suited for orientation,” says Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Department of the Department of Spirits.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we can follow,” he added.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on December 6, and thus also forms the final point of a grey zone where the state licensing system does not yet exist, but ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified during this time - such as how the state provision of a "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana should be agreed with the prohibition of cannabis shops around 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle’s metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his Aurora employees stating that the attorney general would no longer pursue minor marijuana offences in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police would not seek "immediately" criminal prosecutions for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to enforce urban regulations to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug dealers would continue to be prosecuted.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people have to be held accountable for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other crimes.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations that were committed at the time of the incident," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are ambiguous even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer show adults for possession of small quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but he also decided not to let all pending property proceedings fall.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time enforcing the right until it changes,” he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the conflicting reactions throughout the state fostered a deep divergence among local officials in terms of the great green experiment to-day.
District attorneys are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents defendants in court for marijuana offenses and acts locally as a spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Acts.
“They’ve spent such a large part of their lives prosecuting people for the crime that they still can’t accept legalization,” he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are being treated as national patterns for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an age of legal sale, they are also nervous about instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a crime.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will resign.
Despite several arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, is of the opinion that while criminal officials are unlikely to step in to seize smaller amounts of the drugs, they are likely to seek legal, state-regulated marijuana laws under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local municipal administrations approved moratoriums on new marijuana businesses, although these could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided a six-month ban, which is likely to be passed next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community has voted against this amendment of the law.
We look at what the community has decided on and not what the state has decided on.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students of today are being attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended the university that I once thought was the greatest pillar of knowledge in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization – free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my admission to Worscester College in the late 1980s – where I had intended to study history – I had packed my suitcases again and thus brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke up in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said that I would have gone because I had a problem with the fellows having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A N Wilson said that I had left the university because I had been forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason – one reason that seemed so narrow and crueler in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my now-defunct father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students of moderate rights suffers from similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them demanded the same equality protection last week that benefits gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable" because of their political views.
They require a place in their college’s Equalization Committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Her situation was exacerbated by a recently aired documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which Tories portrayed as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
This was shown, among others, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the University of Oxford's conservative student association, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and protruded with a silver suit and silver-lined walking stick.
In other universities, conservative students say they are considered “sin buckets for the introduction of higher tuition fees.”
20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the University of Nottingham’s conservative student association, said in a Sunday newspaper: “There is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without ever getting to know each other.”
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christi who initiated the quest for greater protection, is of the view that such a climate is "unacceptable". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, appointed president of Oxford's conservative student association, says she has justified a growing resentment towards JCR members.
“This poses a danger to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of the members,” she says.
In my first few weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university had voted not to award an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher – a former student – due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even scared Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, where new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste for future events.
I made the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the ridicule of Tory students, but even participated with pleasure.
Political issues such as the miners’ strike, the privatization and the government’s rejection of sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime found their way into the wood-plated spaces of the tutorial.
During my first of these events I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. On what should come then, I had not been caught.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled upon it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like a cake dough, and quite handsome.
"Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students sniffed.
In my eyes there were tears.
“I suggest they take a few French lessons in your spare time – so if you’re not too busy with your social activities,” Pitt teased me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging.
That evening, I was sitting alone in college for dinner when someone tapped me on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory will be harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters indicate to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to change my mind.
I insisted that I was not in all points with Mrs. Thatcher of an opinion.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who had ironically attended Eton College, which is considered to be conservative, told me, “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.”
You're dirty.
Other students shared their opinions.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" asked one.
They fight each other, don't they?
I felt like homosexuals had to have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after the collapse of darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me extended before my spiritual eyes to a fire of reverence and isolation.
The only tutor who openly recognized himself as Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he advised Thatcher on foreign policy and wrote speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for its Marxist-deterministic perspective of history.
In 1997 he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unbelievable.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said quietly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreamy tower tops.
Even my communist friends always set the day in perfect ways.
His wet eyes were drenched.
Give the whole thing a chance.
I'm sure you're just being nudged.
It would break my heart if you left.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also a Tory fan, had given up the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another storyteller had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly broke from shame, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a “brainwashing” and called her “old trottel.”
The relief lasted only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my donkeys gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
I'd like you to call me a whiny sleeping pig.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer in an educational institution under such intimidation and savagery.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford – a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but hides behind an unearned reputation for equality and freedom of thought to this day.
"Valentino prefers elegance of celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of the Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 Haute Couture dresses were put together, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the sticky and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which is still to be seen until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most read aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, over Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent from the modest fashion designer in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
To be in love with the nobility does not have to be disadvantageous.
“At least they don’t put their cocks on your gorgeous carpet, as some beautiful pop music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
Even the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion designer.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to him home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music was recognized and one felt its influence.
“All the guests felt important and loved,” recalls the “top model”, which began her career at the week of the Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
“He never gets out of fashion because his designs are works of art,” she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of greed, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-meter-long run, which proposes a roller exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the run to admire a dreamy "audience" or the masterpieces of Lemme, which Lemeis wears with his clothes, Lemeis, Lemeis,
In this audience of fashion dolls radiate names such as that of Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashionmaker, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the fall/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s Muses.
“I love him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty,” added the ex-hero of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and opinion leader in fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 90s it finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in my grandfather's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a drape top with a décolleté that honors his name.
“It was a dream come true,” says the widow of Rodrigo d’Arenberg.
“Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion designer "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress by Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four-and-a-half-meter long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the supreme society".
Tired of the elite’s “savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre” for years, Valentino is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy's highest award), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honour, accumulates Garavani as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
“I have always been impressed by his refinement, his calm, his well-maintained and perfect appearance,” D’Arenberg admits.
I last saw him at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay a month ago.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; time leaves no trace of him".
And that's what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living by taking sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in eastern Indonesia’s Java island.
To do this, he must climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulfur-containing gas flowing out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones that can weigh a total of up to 70 kilograms, he transports them into two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the abject paths made of stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes to climb at the turtle pace, while they need to maintain the balance and carefully set their steps so that they do not slip and slip out.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocents for every kilo of sulfur they deplete.
Arriving at the top, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk three kilometers up to the scale with the tiresome heavy baskets that a mining company has set a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which since 1960 has been exploiting the occurrences in the volcano and (not to mention) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocents) for each kilo of sulphur.
This then sells them for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocents) each to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of wood chips, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
“Since we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route,” explains Anto, who normally makes three trips a day.
For each route it takes three hours, after which it has been completely achieved, but at the end of the day it then has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What seems like a miserable wage for such a seemingly inhuman effort, however, is three times what he would earn with fieldwork.
“The daily wage of the miners here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high,” explains the bearer, who previously worked as a maurer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, and that for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I am Ja.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life at stake at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sweat has already left his first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
“I will work here for two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but life-sacrificing young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a stretcher.
It shares a dirty wooden hut with other wearers and wakes up every morning at two o’clock because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the dark.
Challenging the shadow, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
About 400 carriers load the basket with sulfur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur mining to save costs, and does not supply any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.5) supplement per camera required by the guardians of this nature park along with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2) from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human body.
“This work is for the animals and not for the people,” protests Madrusin, a stubborn 42-year-old supporter who has been working for three decades since leaving school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as it goes" because he needs the money for the education of his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Even when the sweat burns the throat and the eyes are itching, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners are stuck in the thick columns that rise up from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course, apart from the usual respiratory problems, molds of the glands, shingles, shingles
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg at the age of 53.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks via a goat trail between the bush to the camp in Tamansari at 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder also works as a sulfur carrier at the age of 30.
Time passes, but poverty holds on to generation after generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: the one that works as a human burden on the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame it on their lack of children for their careers, the stress and cost of real estate and child rearing.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an ad for mint candy, but still - or precisely because - they became a viral video on YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
The phrases are part of a rapper song, which local proverbs such as "Swift will be a "bao" (laby) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, maintains the hope that the ad spot reaches a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their “national duty.”
This is something just for the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
As we continue to grow, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this was a topic we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don’t we do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as compose a rap?
1.2 Children
Anyone who does not take this issue lightly is the government of Singapore.
Every year, she spends $1,300 on political measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But so far, everything has had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 – also known as the replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why don't Singaporeans have children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Authority, says this is due to “better education” and “greater career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people, apart from marrying and forming a family, to have significantly more options in terms of life goals and set priorities,” she explains.
These changes in social circumstances have contributed to the higher number of singles and the delay in marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counteract the decline of the population led to resentments among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where barely hidden xenophobia blooms against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s ruling party achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the declining birth rate also shows the known impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, Singapore’s example also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to reach that not so many small apartments are being built.
This has already had an impact on the housing market.
The Authority for Urban Development has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the lone individual, and that they discourage the construction companies from building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate firm EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger residential units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger residential units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give developers clearer orientations, which had previously been put in the way if they wanted to build too many small residential units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the conversations with Singaporeans working in the financial district are to be seen as having little effect.
“People are under a lot of stress, apartments and education are expensive, which is why it’s pushed out by many,” says a young manager.
Children can get others.
“For me, it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women run their careers, stress and cost of ownership and education as reasons for not being able to have children.
That’s why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children – the government can still do so much.
Offline Private Offline is online Private
Privacy Policy
According to the dictionary, this is the property private or "that area of private life where one has the right to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to your everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he announces situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Peri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five teenagers between the ages of 10 and 15, who are often on the web.
In four cases, they linked the term to “something very personal” and “to the password and the user” when they applied it to social networks.
“My deepest secrets I wouldn’t disclose in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of “private” in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he said.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with friends.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t of me, or of someone who makes the fool’s head,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of nudes, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
This includes the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up for Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I'll just upload them," he adds.
“The social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives in the distance or to friends quickly,” he says.
Asked, he replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone recommended a stranger to him, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits to not knowing 20 of the people he added to his friend list.
“That doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to the boy, no one gave him any hints or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If someone is harassing me or demanding them from me, I simply remove them from my user account,” he admits.
José signed up for Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with experiences known today as cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
“He just made it private.”
After that, it explains a number of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's unsympathetic to me or I want to wipe him one.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
“The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, however, the rules of the game have changed,” she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master’s degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work “Digital Natives and Immigrants” formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are you, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them, where we are still learning ourselves,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, “because we demand from them that they have a defined criterion about what is allowed to be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient for that.”
“They should also be selective when it’s most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is is is to ask them questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger. Then why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to post a photo of yourself, like the one you posted by a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
Have you asked the other people for permission before if you have tagged photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Does everyone need to know what you are doing at all times?
Another point is to give them understanding that they need to act online as they do it offline.
These are the same rules.
“Someone outside the internet is acting with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational advisor, comments that it is essential for parents to carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
If they understand all the sections, they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what to share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, children need to be reminded of the lesson “You shouldn’t talk to strangers”.
Conclusion of the UNASUR Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the publication of the declaration of Lima, which was previously announced and should theoretically be signed by the seven present rulers.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI. Ordinary meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Office initially told that they would hand it over after the closure, however, at the time stated that it was time to reschedule.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content was presented to the press by the President of Peru, Oltanta Humala, in brief statements.
Journalists’ access to information about the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, in the press room only the image of the presidential meeting was transmitted without sound with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulating among the journalists was received by the press spokespersons of some of the governments present at the meeting of the Unasur, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document that was circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media dissatisfaction that demanded more information.
Following this, Peru’s presidential office sent the media an email with the “concluding statement” of the summit, but it was Humala’s statement and not the official document at the end of the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite a pressing call by the press, the so-called statement of Lima, which had been announced earlier, was also published little.
On the official website of the ASPA you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems would be available to journalists, but they limited access to information to a large extent.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague, which calls for a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would take the decision of the IGH, which begins Monday in The Hague, in the process that led Lima against Santiago to listen to the pleas of both sides.
“We will comply with and execute the judgment on the differences we are currently making to this international court,” Humala said in a statement.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, enters into agreements and submits to international courts,” Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era adds, welcoming Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the IGH came after Colombia, after deciding on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a grave mistake, had filed a complaint against the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> agreement, in which it agreed to judge the merits of this international court.
The presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 after the resignation of its President Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
President Oltanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunch time in Lima.
The head of state left the final document, in which it reported that 16 decisions were made and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set over a total investment amount of $17 billion.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of Unasur will take "significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in cities and against organized, cross-border crimes, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to trade in nature and to improve in all areas of South America."
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take triumphant moves, but should serve to expand our production capacity and show our people a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connections in South America, especially in rural and border areas... and thus uniting our countries and opening up new economic forms," the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians, who are located on the crossroads of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of whom are expected to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to be an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the start of his participation in the regional meeting that on Saturday in Mexico, he expected a meeting with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to respect the maritime conflict after a ruling by the IGH, questioned by Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>.
“Maybe I’ll meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday),” Santos said.
"We will review all of these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he said.
“I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will deal with this issue as civilised and respectfully as possible,” Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the inauguration of the country’s new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc also met in advance to adopt the action plan for 2013, in which the dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region should be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru holds the presidency at the time of the regional bloc.
“South America must learn to integrate citizens,” says Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with “South America can actually learn something from Europe.”
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru that the Europeans "embarrassed themselves in the Second World War and in other conflicts" and "are practically a homeland today."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that drives the Member States of Unasur.
“The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean Community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past,” he warned.
The President of Ecuador also endorsed the redesign of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the mandate to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and to take into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return, we always sign everything to the South Americans.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and is funded by the United States,” he said, referring to the political asylum Ecuador granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he would not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles, but that he had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there were "reasoned suspicions at the time that Assange had been extradited to a third country and his procedure would not be complied with."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to undergo an interrogation on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish jurisprudence allowed this through a video conference that could have been carried out via Ecuador's embassy in London."
Correa explained that there was a risk that the health and mental state of Assange would be affected.
"Since he was in our embassy, I haven't spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," the head of state of Ecuador said.
However, there is a risk that he will take physical and mental harm because he is trapped in a tight space and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
"This would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum Assange has been granted since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, is to grant him a free letter to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe to find a solution to the problem.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word for this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, is conducting a series of proceedings on various European bodies,” he said.
And "if the UK gives this free letter tomorrow, in my opinion, this is done."
And if Sweden asked Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype how it allowed Swedish jurisdiction and in other cases, the problem was solved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intent, and the lies that deterred free expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but the bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he wished that Ecuador would no longer be dominated by such journalists "and neither by the bankers nor by hegemonic and petty-bourgeois countries", and anticipated that in a re-election "he would deepen the revolution to continue the path in that right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until his next election, arguing that the organism "must remain hard and not give rise to opportunism and not to anyone as a legally disguised coup d'état" because it "became the Democratic Paraguay's legitimacy."
The President of Ecuador also holds the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favoured the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, for "absolutely final."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so you can overcome them and look ahead.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to call international bodies if both countries commit to take the judgment, even if it falls very hard."
Regarding the possibility that he will stand as a candidate for the next Ecuadorian presidential election in order to reach his third consecutive term, he stated that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it also falls very hard."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never personally interested me, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfill that responsibility,” he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term as president, after that I withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
“It’s decided,” he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuela's Vice President Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for a planned, routine treatment and that he would be expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean a relapse in the health of President Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in any way," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State took part in the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima today, which ended with the call for higher regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death due to AIDS is today a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to be HIV positive.
“It was like a bomb hit,” he says of the moment he was diagnosed, which the doctor tried to “weaken” without recognizable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to inform himself about it; and this with such a commitment that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At the time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
AIDS was a synonym for death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome even with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who do not know anything about their disease and in which the virus has already done damage and exhausted their immune system, and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the occurrence of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who receives the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," stated the head of the HIV-Ein.
According to Andrade Villanueva, a specialist in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS4, scientists have since 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and the quality of life of the CD are not related to the degree of impairment of the immune system of the people with Zhgen, while the age of the person with Zhgen depends on the level of the disease.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who receive HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25 years can in this sense "get 75 years of age without problems as long as they are under control," said this expert.
In order to properly accommodate this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Even though mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is true that since the national prevalence of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2011 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is still true that, since the appearance of the national prevalence of AIDS has decreased by 60 percent.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and as of May this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that since 2005 there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs.
- So why are people still dying?
In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so it is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that people come in a far advanced state because they do not know their infection condition, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence global mortality, earlier diagnoses are needed, which is why all people who require this need to be offered massive detection tests."
According to this proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevenci<0xC3><0xB3>n del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also the patients like Fabrizio, who had his test done at a private laboratory, and for the only reason that he was able to do so,
Everything is different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die, and they don’t want to hear anything.
“If I have to die, I’d rather die three times,” they say in my case.
The change was for improvement, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
“I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person,” says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who have today as part of the world’s A.
The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly, like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the loading table
There are big gaps between the health programs and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has accepted the issue of HIV.
The most important thing is prevention.
“The distribution of condoms was actually increased; in the past they were delivered individually, now they give us packages of a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom,” he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"What do you need the?" is a common spot question of social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system who do not want to expose young people, the correspondent assured.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be located behind the shop table, but in outlets in public toilets of facilities frequented by young people.
It should not promote promiscuousness.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez answered the question of whether condoms would be distributed under his administration.
“Sexuality doesn’t look that way; it’s best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity,” he added.
Key details of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is nationally ranked 4th in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in terms of HIV.
92% of infections occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for every registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know it.
After the U.S. Court of Appeals has upheld a judgment that does not recognize the restructuring of the obligations of the Vitro Group, which was reached through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an unfortunate precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country has created the payment problem.
So one could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow Mexican laws in the country of the stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements, are not valid.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas court for the northern district of Texas on June 15 results in the Mexican companies being helplessly exposed to seizure of their property beyond the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the door and door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit’s New Orleans-based appeals court initially says that the main proceedings are the commercial bankruptcy proceedings dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created, with the American Law Institute being used as a scoundrel.
Secondly, the judgment provides that without the votes of the companies after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy estate that the branches of Vitro had with their parent company, the required majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose commitments have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Commercial Competitions) group of companies.
It is also true that, after the votes of the branches have been withdrawn, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained to the courts of the United States against Vitro, i.e. the hedge funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliott Internacional and Liverpool Limited, no longer have any hesitation.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation from 2008 as part of the major economic crisis in the United States, which hit the country.
For this reason, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family objects to the same Court of Appeal so that the vote takes place in the plenary, i.e. by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
In the event of failure to do so, the Cerciorare case, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher court, shall be brought before the Supreme Court of the United States in this case.
The gravity of this case is that the court has omitted a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure amicus curiae (friend of the court), in which the procedure carried out by Vitro is described in the framework of the Law on Trade Disputes, and in which it is pointed out that the dispute is not
It is also noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-band caramboles: a blow for vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the ads by the Mexican trade unions for air traffic against the former owner Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade, who is accused of a fraudulent administration, did not come forward for several months, the Asociaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Union of the Pilots).
Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morineau’s application has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing the judiciary.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the central administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from Bank IXE’s trust account F/589 under the name Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a meeting on the weekend at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, complemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (National Chamber of Processing Industry) has achieved to unite the governors in the southeast to resist the monumental establishment that partially destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead.
Because the government did not comply with a request from the Senate to explain under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been settled, according to the Mexican Institute for Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place, although the Senate had taken the opportunity out of consideration because it considered them to be a violation of free expression on social networks.
Homex long-term
In an effort to pay for long-term liabilities without compromising short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings on the market stock exchange certificates of over 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identical issues that promise to pay interest every 28 days.
Establishment of a competitive
Consisting of the companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leading information technology companies, a group of companies was founded under the name Competitive, whose goal is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to over $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball world bowler Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has been involved in basketball for over 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large intellectual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of the lower classes, player of the first national league, delegate and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n or president of the Basketball Association.
“I have put on many hats in basketball for my entire life, even several years at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 90s,” Reyes recalled when he visited Primera Hora at his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he met Isabel.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n im Herzen
The most emotional memories are those of his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-owner or managing director of the club.
“These were my best years I’ve enjoyed the most, because I’ve been part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether it’s as a manager, co-manager or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a 1981 championship, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," Reyes says.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a very strong and 2m player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who became a citizen and was one of our best throwers.
I still know how he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide another one.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was awarded to him, but already from a distance because he was already in the top position of the association in 1988.
At this time, he preferred to enjoy his performances and that of Mincy in the national team.
I still know when we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States for the first time.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we placed fourth, what should have been bronze, if not for this Canadian referee, who let us repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this 1990 World Cup group the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as those who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the USA team a fight, like when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
Not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz) were there again, but also the young players (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the brothers Le<0xC3><0xB3>n (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who did not become a conniver in 1990.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure, was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitner as a substitute for the blocked players due to the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against each prediction.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
This was without a doubt Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n.
And this without considering his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill very much.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 90s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, play only in their area and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, children unnecessarily make many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed trainings and courses for coaches, table officers and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I love listening to music, watching videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and occasionally going to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, and became famous worldwide for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, secretive and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. this year in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon from cancer complications, according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving celebration.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original person and lived life in full swing,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman became known on television as a nice guy between 1965 and 1970 with the sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" of the NBC television station.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "Dshinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He was also an actor in two short-lived comedies, such as "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971–72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly despicable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The drama series of the CBS television series about the Ewing Clan and other characters in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The commercial "Who Shot J.R.?", which was supposed to create the expectation of an episode full of emotions, where the character of Hagmann was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
The series reached a viewership record at the time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers turning "Dallas" into the second most-watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin who had shot J.R.'s sister-in-law (played by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had weakened her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave town, but others had reasons to want to see her dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, irreplaceable man with a charismatic smile: a reluctant businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to introduce his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
“I know what to stand on the tombstone of J.R.,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as an "enormous personality on and off screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of admirers in the world and keeps us in our hearts who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the television channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just filmed, the broadcaster informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT as to how Hagmann’s loss would be dealt with in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatre stages in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t write anything that I thought could hurt someone or hurt them in any way,” he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he volunteered for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to support anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I will meet them when their operations are due and after," he said in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as “don’t worry, it’s a little uncomfortable the first time, but you’ll be fine.”
He also opposed smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course that studies the "end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some have called the "Deudarmageddon", as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists believe the apocalypse begins.
"I haven't noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester there has ever been," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If someone analyzes what happened in the world today, as if we were 30 days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he’s not the only professor who offers courses on the “end of the world” this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In Temple, visiting Professor Barry Becker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas spread over time,” he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and investigated how they compared to real life.
“I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible,” said Becker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a visiting professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course called “The End of the World”.
“We don’t take up 2012 so we can always keep the option of stopping the course again, in case the world doesn’t go down,” Restall said.
Despite the "expected decline", students must study, create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be conducted on the eve of the apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance than “to work through the night where the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
“In two hours there were no more seats,” Restall said of his course for high-average students, which filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students asking if there were still seats available.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is among the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectarian or religious mentality is actually just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for Psychology and Nursing explains that he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
“I never heard of a lesson where this is being taught,” he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students surveyed — and less yet a professor — stated to believe in the last date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with the Maya’s prophecy, and in a certain way we discredit them,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at Temple, West Chester, last year.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He notes, however, that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that goes back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
“Otherwise, people don’t think so,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course on the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world,” he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher court.
We have a blessing from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days have been spoken of by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophize about December 21 being the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world comes.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrations over "the end of the world".
“Maybe I’ll call a few friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
