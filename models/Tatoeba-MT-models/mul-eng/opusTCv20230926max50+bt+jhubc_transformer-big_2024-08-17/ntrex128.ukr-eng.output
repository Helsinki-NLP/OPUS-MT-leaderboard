Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they will “associate with the maps”
Some CHA are appalled by the recommendation to change the name of their post to “Member of the Welsh Parliament” (MWP).
This recommendation emerged through plans to change the name of the assembly to the "Parliament of Wales".
The entire political spectrum is concerned that this may cause a stir.
One CHA from the Labour Party said that his group is concerned about the Roma with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, “twp” means “unintelligible”, and “pwp” means an act of defecation.
The CHA of the Welsh Party said its group as a whole was "unsatisfied" and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservatives said his group was "unprecedented" about the name change, but pointed out that MWP could quickly become a "map".
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing legislation to change the names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Self-Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of the public discussion of the proposals, and the renaming of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament received broad support.
As for how to call the CHA, the Commission proposes to call them "members of the Welsh Parliament", i.e. WMP, but the MWP variant received the greatest support from the public.
Of course, CHA is offering alternatives, but trying to reach an agreement can cause problems for Chief Elina Jones, who is due to file a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules on the removal of the CHA and the structure of the committee system.
The CHA will hold a final vote on its new name when the legislation is discussed.
Macedonian people go to vote on a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The vote was organized in order to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbor is a claim to the territory of Greece, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
President of Macedonia George Ivanov, who is opposed to holding a referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a price that needs to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint-Martin are silent, because the churches of Harlem are experiencing difficult times
“The old people I talked to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
There’s no such thing or anything now.”
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
“Today, people are socializing differently.
At least it’s no longer a local living room where they regularly go.”
As for the churches, Adams fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and “ sooner or later they will be where they started.”
Churches, he added, can replace houses with condominiums, and there will be people who will not help the saints who remain nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white,” Adams explained, “so it will speed up the day when all these churches close, because it is unlikely that the majority of those who move to condominiums will become their parishes.”
Both churches were built by white communities even before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and Saint-Martin – ten years after it.
The original white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The black community, which held ceremonies nearby, received the right of ownership of the building.
St. Martin moved to a black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street of Harlem. These merchants did not want to hire their blacksmiths and maids.
In 1939, the fire severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners wanted to restore it and set up a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son and successor of Johnson's father in Saint Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who played at the carillon in July, called it "cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical tool."
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon 18 years ago at Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merrivezer, there were no replacements in Saint-Martin.
What has been happening in Saint-Martin over the past few months is a complicated story about architects and contractors. Some of them have been involved by church leaders, others by the episcopal diocese.
The Council — the governing body of the parish, which consists of the leaders of the Mirians — wrote to the diocese in July that it was concerned that the diocese “will try to pass on the expenses” of the council while the council did not take part in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the parish.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark was injured by a 13-year-old boy who was chasing lobsters in California.
According to officials, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him. The boy chased the lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobsters season.
The attack took place at almost 7 a.m. near Bicon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning, he had been hanging out with friends for about half an hour when he heard that the boy wanted help, and together with the group rushed to him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a seizure from a captured lobster, but then realized that the boy was screaming, “I’ve been bitten!
They tasted me!”
As soon as he got to the boy, he saw that his key was completely broken.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water,’” Hammel added.
The boy was taken to the Rada Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Jayles told a briefing for the media that a few weeks ago a shark was spotted in the area, but it was found that it did not belong to dangerous species of sharks.
Jails added that the victim had received traumatic damage to the upper part of the trunk.
For the purposes of investigation and security, the authorities for 48 hours closed access to the beach from the beach of Ponto in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas.
Jayles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using cosmetics islands similar to those found in universiades. Work on the islands will be qualified sellers.
As part of the increased exit to the British market of cosmetics worth 2.8 billion pounds (will continue to grow at a time when the volume of sales of clothes and goods for the house is decreasing) the increased islands with cosmetics will be tested in 11 countries and in the countries of the country.
Investments in cosmetics are linked to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the living space, which was previously used under TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the cosmetics range and offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space: there will be brand zones, similar to those available in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also updates the range of cosmetics Boutique: now most of the presented products will not be tested on animals, which is increasingly demanded by young buyers.
In addition, the retailer Fragrance Shop is testing its trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, north London, last week, and the second will open in Selli-Ouk, Birmingham, later in the year.
Internet shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of food every day in small stores forces supermarkets to make additional efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Cupe, executive director of Sainsbury’s, said their stores would become more like supermarkets, as a network of supermarkets is trying to counter Aldi and Lidl counters with the help of more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opens Argos departments in hundreds of its stores, also opened a number of Habitats departments. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claims that it increased the sales of food products, as well as made both networks bigger.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to update the departments of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals ended in a failure.
Sainsbury's tested cooperation with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after controversy over how to split the proceeds from pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business (281 pharmacies) Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance of our cosmetics islands to make the atmosphere more pleasant for buyers.
We have also invested in specially trained consultants who will be able to give advice.
The range of brands presented to us is designed to meet any needs, and the pleasant setting and convenient location mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is a competition of the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones 'slowed' by the fact that Holly Willoughby came out of a deal worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
Star "The Dragon's Lion" Peter Jones "crazed" by the fact that TV host Holly Willoughby came out of an agreement with his brand of goods for life (the deal costs 11 million pounds sterling) to focus on the new Ikhts & TVs
Willoughby doesn't have time for a brand of clothing and accessories Truly.
The business pair was associated with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Peltrow.
37-year-old program manager This Morning announced her departure to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby brought the star of Peter Jones' Dragon's League to the story when at the last minute she came out of their lucrative goods business for life to focus on new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "crazy" when his golden girl from the TV show confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of Jones's business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals were not worth 1.5 million pounds.
This business was associated with the Goop brand of Gwyneth Peltrow and was to double Willoughby's stock, which is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was coming from Truly, Jones flew out of the UK to one of her holiday homes.
The source said: “True, without a doubt, was Holly’s top priority.
He was to be her long-term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to leave the business stunned all interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost the day before the launch.
The headquarters in Marlowe is full of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the UK’s highest-paid star, This Morning, could have cost firms millions through large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothing) and create further delays.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Johns and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Capp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple held a holiday together, with Jones owning 40 percent of Bolduin's shares, which is engaged in television production.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony McCartney as I'm A Celebrity's lead on ITV.
The source, close to Johns, said last night: “We will not comment on his case.”
A tough conversation, “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for a comment that someone would consider “non-presidential” as well as for a very positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump go on such great acts?
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news anchor. —
I didn’t do anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
But the denuclearization talks have come to a deaf end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “responsive response” from the United States to its first steps.
Instead, he noted, the United States is continuing sanctions aimed at supporting the pressure.
Promising a speech at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have such a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American servicemen to their homes.
He also defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave presidentially, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this battle-packed stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed islands, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was affected, the national disaster was not announced, and this is a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not applying for international assistance, so it is somewhat difficult,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Although "Save the Children" is gathering a team to travel to Pal, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel will be able to work on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the national disaster relief agency, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Pal in order to determine whether or not to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Given the fact that earthquakes are constantly taking place in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
In the province of Acheh, tsunami shelters are built, but they are not characteristic of other coasts.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Pal, although the warning was effective, probably contributed to the deaths.
Moving between a number of Indonesian islands is not only at the best times.
Tires make logistics even more difficult.
The medical ship, which was in Lomboc to treat the victims of the earthquake, is sailing to Pal, but reaching the site of the new disaster will be able to do at least three days later.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia’s infrastructure the basis of his election campaign and increased the cost of roads and railways.
But the funding deficit has created problems for the administration of Mr. Joko, who plans to re-elect next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by a long-standing interfaith hostility in those parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority chose a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, tens of thousands expelled from their homes as a result of opposition by Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool beats the goal from the depth of the field and equals the score from Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the Premier League with his goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Starridge received a pass from Gerardo Shachiri when he was at a distance of about 27 meters from the Chelsea gate. At this point his team lost with a score of 1-0.
He stopped the ball on his left leg and charged it in the direction of the far bar.
The ball flew high above the penalty in the direction of the upper right corner of the gate.
He flew over the floating Cape of Arrisabalaga and fell into the gate.
“It was just an attempt to take that position so as not to waste time. Players like Shachiri always go on the attack as far as possible, so I just tried to make sure as much time as possible,” Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching, and I made one touch, I didn't think about it too much, and I just took the ball.
Chelsea led with a score of 1-0 after the first half, in which Belgian star Eden Azar scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The blue attacker handed the pass back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>, rolled around the middle of the field and quickly ran to half Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly played against the wall in the middle of the field.
Then he made a nice pass that brought Azara to the penalty.
Azar deflected the defense and made a decisive blow with his left foot in the net of the far bar. The ball passed through the gate of the "Liverpool" Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the St. Paul Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from a tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the Indonesian disaster relief agency on Sunday morning.
Many people remained trapped in pieces of buildings destroyed during the Friday earthquake with a force of 7.5 points, which caused waves at a height of 6 meters, the press secretary of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told a press conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, was engulfed in fragments of destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
The investigation into the murder began after a woman’s body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson-Muse, John Street. A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called to respond to people who saw or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is now in the early stages, but I ask all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have taken something on the video recorder, to contact us, as the information on these videos can be very important for our investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the woman whose body had been found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
Today, in the second half of the day, friends who believe they know a woman have arrived at the scene of the crime to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they are currently informing the victim’s immediate relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson-Muse, was just trying to get back to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter and leave the house.
When he found out what had happened, he lost the gift of language.
Now the residents are told that it will be hours before they are allowed to return home.
Someone heard a police officer telling a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime, a woman appeared in tears.
She says, “It’s so horrible.”
At 14:00 two police vans were standing outside the fence, another van in front of the fence.
Several police officers were standing behind the fence and were followed by a multi-apartment house.
All who have information are asked to write a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call number 101 or anonymously call Crimestoppers at number 0800 555 111 and call code 247 and date September 30.
The statue of Cromwell near Parliament becomes a new monument, which suffers from the “rewriting of history”
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved payment for the destruction in the Taliban style of many cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Community called Mr. Crick’s proposal “stupid” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Community, said: “Given the current debate about the removal of statues, the fact that the statue of Oliver Cromwell at Westminster Palace will be a target was inevitable.”
The iconoclast during the English Civil Wars was not carried out either by Cromwell himself or by his order.
Probably, Cromwell will be undeservingly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great statue of Cromwell by sculptor William Hamo Thornycroft is a testament to the mood of the 19th century and part of the historiography of the character, which, in the opinion of many, is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many, probably more in the late 19th century than now, consider Cromwell to be a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, of monarchy.
Whether such an idea is entirely accurate is the subject of the ongoing historical debate.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the well-known figures who represents one side of this conflict.
His achievements as a Lord Protector should also be noted and honored.”
A pig-killer destroys a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, the farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on the market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by the name of Yuan, was found dead in blood with a broken artery near a pig farm on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
In Xinhai, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig is going to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm.
It is reported that on Wednesday he left with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and saw that the pig’s door had been opened.
The brother noted that there was a large shed with blood on the sidewalk in the piggy bank.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 249-kilogram cab had destroyed the farmer until his death.
“My twin brother’s legs were in blood and disfigured,” said the twin brother of the victim named Wu, who was quoted as saying by Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about a year later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to John or his twin brother.
The market leader told Evening News that when police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was locked up to prevent her from attacking people.
It is reported that seven I Yuan and the market administration are discussing compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of a pig attack on humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and caused a man to be critically injured.
Ten years before that, a pig weighing 295 kg held a Welsh farmer pressed to the tractor until the farmer’s wife scared the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can become a “trigger.”
“They’re just playful.
They're like kids, they're very inquisitive... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with proper respect,” he said.
Residues of Hurricane Rose Will Bring Extensive Floods to the Southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is slowing down, moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rain with valleys to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa had a wind speed of 137 km per hour (this hurricane category 1) at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rose will go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific begins to form a liquid that moves east to the west coast of the United States. When on Monday Rose approaches the Peninsula of Lower California in the form of a tropical storm, it will start to smother a strong tropical wetland to the U.S.
On Monday, Rosa brought up to 25.4 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Next in the coming days, the tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching deposit, will create strong tides in the southwest.
In this area from 2.54 to 10.2 cm of rain will cause dangerous floodplains, garbage flows and the possibility of displacement in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will lead to an increase in rainfall of up to 5–7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5-10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in a significant area of Arizona.
Flooding floods are possible with a rapid deterioration of the conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We strongly advise not to go to the desert on foot, because possible tropical floods.
Heavy rain can make canyons stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring here gusts of wind and dust storms.
The approach of the wetlands will cause places of heavy rain in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The amount of precipitation can exceed 1.27 cm, which can lead to inefficient waste streams and mud roads.
This will be the first flooding in the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical floods will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early in the morning on Monday, and in the evening on Monday and Tuesday the rain will become more extensive.
Heavy rain will go over the "Fore-Corners" from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, intense temperatures can be observed throughout the U.S., as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to sharp temperature breaks at short distances.
On Sunday you will be able to observe a wonderful example of sharp temperature fluctuations in the central part of the United States.
This is a nearly 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and De Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer heat will try to come back and spread.
It is expected that a significant area of the center and east of the U.S. will be warm by October, and the temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York City could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees Celsius above the average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of exceeding average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing in Brett Kavanaugh’s case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television networks watched the fascinating testimony of a candidate for the post of Supreme Court judge Brett Cavano and Christine Blaise Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence in 1980.
The political confrontation continued, the channels interrupted the planned programs to report the latest news on Friday: an agreement prepared by Arizona Senator Jeff Flayk to conduct the FBI's one-week investigation into the indictment.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his emotional testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it wasn’t.
More than 20.4 million people were likely to follow this on Friday, according to Nielsen, a research company.
The company counted the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not immediately able to get the numbers on other networks that also showed the hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also at Nielsen there are usually problems with measuring the number of people watching TV in the office.
For comparison, such an audience by size is similar to an audience that is watching a game of the play-off series or an Oscar award.
Fox News Channel, whose leading think-tanks strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was the leader among all the channels during the day-long listening session, with an average audience of 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Fleik became the central figure of Friday’s drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh. After that, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras recorded how protesters shouted at Flayk when he tried to go on the elevator to the hearing of the Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes, during which he was licked, which aired live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, “You have power, and many women are powerless.”
Fleik said his office published the statement and, before closing the elevator, added that he would say more at the hearing of the committee.
All cable and broadband channels were broadcast live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on the extension of Kavanaugh's candidacy for a full Senate vote.
Fleik said he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, which is demanded by a democratic minority.
Flaika was partially convinced of the conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After a conversation with Kuns, and then a few more senators, Flaik made the decision.
Fleik's choice had an impact, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to nominate a candidate for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May Accuses Critics of ‘Games in Politics’ Around Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “games in politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
On 29 September 2018, Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
In another interview, which appeared alongside Theresa’s interview on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister of her government Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Chekers’ Brexit plan, saying that it would offer Britain and the EU “to pull one out of the country.”
Who shot Wade Sims: Police arrested Dayton Simpson on suspicion of the death of a player at the University of Louisiana
Police arrested a suspect in a shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
The 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, the Batton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of a dispute between Simmons and Simpson, and police said Simmons had lost his glasses during the fight.
According to CBS affiliate WAFB, the police removed the glasses from the crime scene and noted that Simpson's DNA was found on them.
When asked about Simpson, police said he had confessed to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was assigned a bet of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge coroner's office on Friday released a previous report, which states that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Department expresses its gratitude to the Special Branch for the search for Louisiana State Police fugitives, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the South University Police Department, and local citizens for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
Louisiana State University Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement agencies for “obedience and aspiration to justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
Ford grew to a height of 198 cm in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at the University of Louisiana.
Last season, his average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "disappointed" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“That’s what worries you all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano tosses ash to Mexico
Popol, which emits Popocatepetl volcano, reached the southern areas of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for the Prevention of Natural Disasters on Saturday called on Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as activity began in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center monitored a number of noises and squeaks.
In the photo on social networks you can see thin ash layers on the windshield of cars in the surroundings of Mexico, such as Hochimilko.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, after an earthquake with a force of 7.1 points in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters protesting for independence clashed with the special police department. Thousands of people joined the protesters’ demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the anniversary of the end of the year.
The pro-separatist group in the masks, which were held by special appointees, threw them with eggs and powder paint, which created dark clouds of dust on the streets, on which usually full tourists.
Clashes took place and later that day, the police used sticks to restrain the aggression.
A few hours later, a group of supporters of independence who chanted “We will not forget, we will not forgive!” met the supporters of the preservation of the country, who shouted: “Long live Spain!”
According to the local press, fourteen people were provided with assistance in the light injuries received during the protests.
A year after the referendum on October 1, which was recognized by Madrid as illegal, but noted by Catalan separatists, the tension in the region, which seeks independence, remains high.
Voters mostly voted for independence, but the turnout was low, as most of those who opposed the separation boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting in polling stations across the region.
The independence groups spent the night on Friday in tents in order to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to go another route.
The 68-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy that they can vote, but now we’re in a deaf corner,” he said.
Despite the vital, but very difficult victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties, who speak for independence, were not able to maintain the momentum of this year, because many of their most famous leaders are in good standing.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took out a protest to support the police on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians from both sides.
“The tension is getting stronger,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the investigative insulator since the end of last year, announced that he would be running for the European Parliament next year.
“The candidate’s status in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression that we observe from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car drove into the house <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car drove several times into a home in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballinagard-Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noted that the gate and the house itself had been damaged.
It is quite possible that at some point the car was shot from the arbaleta.
Menga's strike provided Livingston with a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal in "Livingston" became a winner
Raised in the "Livingstone" class stunned the "Rangers" and brought Steven Gerrard a second defeat out of 18 games as manager of the club "Aibrox".
Dolly Menga’s strike proved decisive: Gary Holt’s team rose to the same level as the Hibernians per second.
Gerard's team has not won a single win in the Premier League this season and next week will play with the Harts leaders, from which she lags by eight points.
Before that, on Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna as part of the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues his unbeaten run to six games in the division, and head coach Holt has not yet suffered a defeat after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
“Livingston” is missing the chances that provide uninvited guests.
Holt's team was supposed to be ahead of them long before they hit, because their straightness creates the Rangers with all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but made a blow along the gate, then Alan Litgow broke through the gate after he pressed in and accepted Craig Halket's blow along the gate, which he made his head.
The masters were satisfied with the fact that they allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, while they knew that they could cause problems to guests from standard positions.
Thus, a decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson engaged Meng, who took the ball and shot from the center of the penalty.
By this point, the Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball, but the protection of the owners of the field proved unbreakable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's strike was repelled by the legs of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor. Litgow was knocked over the door in another standard Levinstone combination.
The caps were constantly flown to the Livingston penalty and were constantly neutralized, and two applications for a penalty — after Halkett’s attack on Glenn Middleton, who had been replaced, and by hand — were rejected.
The phenomenon of "Livingston": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Toni Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and the result of «Livingston».
They all played well together, they continued to exceed expectations on this high-altitude trajectory.
Their style of play and composition practically did not change after returning to the highest level, but one should give due credit to Holt for how he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played grandiosely, very well organized defenses, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to be constantly vigilant.
"Rangers", however, had no inspiration.
In the past, they played very well under the leadership of Gerard, but now they do not significantly reach those standards.
They didn’t have the last ball – only once they broke the defense of the field’s owners – and it was something like a wake-up call for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an Unambiguously Received in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, there was a smile and a blue sky.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
Among them were some disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters of the president still showed up nearby to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan—among them many Kurds—have also made themselves heard. They condemn Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests are evidence of a guest’s inconsistency, which some German Turks called a hero, and others a dictator.
A road accident in Depford: cyclist killed in a collision with a car
The cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Beswood Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the area of Deptford in the southeast of the city around 10:15 a.m. British Standard Time.
The driver stopped, and paramedics came to the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident happened a few months after another cyclist died after the driver fled the scene on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from a Saturday’s accident.
London police said they are working to establish a man's face to inform his closest relatives.
Driving is prohibited and bus routes have been changed, and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Injured in Concussion
Six prison workers were injured as a result of disturbances in the male prison of the strict regime, the prison administration said.
The riots at Her Majesty Long-Laartin's prison in Wustershire began at about 9:30 a.m. British Standard Time on Sunday and still continue.
To stop the unrest, initiated by eight prisoners and located in one wing, a special unit "Tornado" was called up.
Officers were provided with medical assistance in connection with minor facial injuries received at the scene of the incident.
A representative of the prison service commented: “In order to resolve the incident, which is taking place in the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin, a specially trained prison staff was involved.
Six staff members received medical assistance in connection with the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be directed to the police and that their stay behind bars can be extended.”
In the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin more than 500 prisoners, among them the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was sent for hospital treatment after the attack in prison.
In October last year, a special police division called for the prison to stop serious disturbances, during which the prisoners were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with floodplains (to land it may be beneficial)
Tropical depression rarely hits Arizona, but that’s what could happen early next week, as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa are heading through the southwest desert, creating a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning on Monday and Tuesday on the territory from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Las Vegas.
Rosa is expected to go straight through the Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Hurricane Center, in the area of Mogollon-Rome in Arizona is expected from 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and places up to 15.24 cm of precipitation.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of precipitation, places possibly up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of flood floods, the Rosie rain can be a blessing, as the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these floods are likely to be useful, as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought, weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rose leads to disembarkation on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning still in the force of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 19.3 km per hour.
The storm is met with cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
Thus, it is expected that with the force of a tropical storm in the day or in the evening on Monday, a hurricane will cause a shift in Mexico.
The amount of rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be significant, creating a significant risk of floods.
“It is expected that the total amount of precipitation from Lower California to Northwest Sonora will be from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, places possibly up to 25.4 cm,” — reports weather.com.
Next, Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will go further through Arizona and late on Tuesday night will reach southern Utah.
“The main danger that is expected of Rosa or her remains is the very strong rains in Lower California, northwest Sonora, and southwest of the American desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening floods and torrents of garbage in the deserts, as well as landslides in the mountainous area.
Midsomer North attack: four people arrested for attempted murder in North Midsomer
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old boy with knife wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Exelcior-Terras area of Midsomer-Northon at approximately 4:00 a.m. British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in stable condition.
The 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old men were arrested at night in the Radstock area, police reported Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking to respond to anyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffering the stupidity and anger" of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wilinga, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffering the stupidity and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the process of ousting.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, involuntarily and emotionally denying Christine Blaise Ford's allegation that he committed sexual violence against her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at a hearing on the charges she was charged with.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day “the American people saw the brilliance, character and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, a lawyer with impeccable experience of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president ran to recall Kavanaugh’s resignation when he spoke of the importance of Republicans appearing in the mid-term elections.
“In five weeks, we will have one of the most important elections in our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m really running,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats’ mission was to “resist and hinder.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, an aide to one of the Republican leaders told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims is growing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them plunged into the ocean when giant waves hit the beach due to intense earthquakes and tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the country’s government said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people took a break at a beach festival in the city of Pal<0xC3><0xBA> on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) high broke through the shores, beating many to death and destroying everything on their way.
Tsunami occurred after an earthquake with a force of 7.5 points.
“When a tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still engaged in their affairs on the beach and did not immediately begin to run away, and they became victims,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian agency for liquidation, told a briefing in Jakarta.
“It wasn’t just a tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit everything that was on land,” Nugroho said, adding that, before hitting the shoreline, the tsunami passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 km/h).
To save himself from the tsunami, some people ironed into trees and survived, he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pal.
On the aerial photographs published by the disaster relief agency, it can be seen that many buildings and shops are destroyed, the bridges are turned over and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
Protests in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) said that the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the energy of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have contributed to the strength of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho called the damage "wide-scale" and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the casualties and damage could be greater than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Pal in an area called Donggal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
“The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we didn’t get any information” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers had traveled to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received widespread criticism for not reporting that the tsunami hit the Pole, although officials said the waves came at the time indicated in the warning.
On amateur frames, which people shared in social networks, you can see how a man on the upper floor of the house shouts crazy warnings about the approaching of tsunamis to people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, the water wall broke into the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a serious disconnection of electricity, which broke the link around the Pole, which made it difficult to coordinate the rescue actions.
Soldiers began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated people still very much need food and other items of first need.
The city’s airport has been opened only for assistance, and it will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit evacuation centers in Pal on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is more than 800.
It's very bad.
Employees of the World Vision organization from Donggala have safely reached the city of Pal, where they are hiding in birch tents installed in the courtyard of their office, but on the way they have seen scenes of devastation, Mr Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he shared.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began to take decisive action to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive experience were not allowed to go to Pal.
According to Indonesian rules, the financing, supply and provision of personnel across the border can only begin if the place of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Auliya Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "Well, this is a national disaster," we will be able to accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been granted."
Already the second night descended on the Pole after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, and the friends and families of those who have not yet been found, still hoped that the appearance of their loved ones would be a miracle that will decorate these gloomy stories of actual evils.
On Saturday, the little boy got out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers found a woman lying under a rock for two days with her mother’s body next door.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders to participate in the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paraplanners who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As an elder in the field of paragliding, I have my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon says that a few hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel, which spread among the community of paragliders, he desperately sent a message on WhatsApp to Paul’s opponents, who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked only with a single grey collar, not double blue collars.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
The thieves collected $26,750 while replenishing the ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thief stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who ran a ATM in Newport on the Levee, the Newport Police Department said.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man “runs back to employee Brink” and steals a bag of money destined to be replenished.
Witnesses have noticed several suspects who escaped from the scene of the crime, are reported in the news, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about these persons should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to E
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to E.
On Saturday, announcing the change to Twitter, he wrote: “Previously officially known as Kanye West.”
West's 41-year-old name was E, and he used this abbreviation as a name for his album, released in June.
The change took place on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
On the show, he replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for “emotional reasons,” the show’s author said.
This is not only a shortening of the current professional name, West has previously said that this word has a religious content for him.
“I believe that ‘it’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Kanye, meaning "one", has been shortened to simply "E" - it is simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Brazer Love.
West's former colleague, Jay-Z, also experimented with defecation and big letters.
Mexican President Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promises not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has promised never to use the army against civilians. Soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised “never to use an army to stifle the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military opened a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing about 300 people, and then the left student movements began to take place throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to those who are studying, and to open more free public universities.
He noted that the lack of employment and the lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
U.S. Should Double Funding in the Field of Artificial Intelligence
As China is increasing its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, according to an investor and practice in AI Kay-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after different parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, although the U.S. does not have a formal AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aspires to become the No. 1 in innovation in the field of AI by 2030.
“The double budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US, and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the likelihood that the next major breakthrough in AI will be made in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “China, Silicon Valley, and New World Order” was printed this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in Face++, one of the most well-known AI companies in China.
In the 1980s at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on the AI system, which beat the best American player in the Otello, and later became the CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee noted previous tech competitions conducted by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency of Advanced Defense Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when they would be next to help identify future prospective participants.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China taking academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring lights from universities to work on AI in recent years.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the U.S. increase efforts in the field of AI.
“I believe that the Green Card should automatically be offered to candidates of science in the field of AI,” he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence of the New Generation in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China provides funding to individuals who work in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations distribute money to American researchers, while the quality of academic work in the United States is poor.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
As for the National Science Foundation, it is now investing more than $100 million a year in research into AI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which sought to set up the Commission on National Security of Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any steps for several months.
Macedonian voters vote in referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change the country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, which will allow to resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia’s possibility of membership in Europe.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the agreement argue that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and because of the boycott campaign there are doubts whether the voter turnout of the minimum 50% will reach, which will allow the referendum to be considered valid.
The question in the bulletin of the referendum reads: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price, which Macedonia, one of the countries that formed after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should be paid for admission to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote does not carry legal obligations, enough members of parliament have said they support it to make it decisive.
To change the name, two-thirds of the votes will be needed in Parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of violations until 13:00.
However, the turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections of 2016, when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots into the ballot box.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said Goose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in Skopje.
September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Dusko gave their vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country, which will open the way for accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Volodymyr Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and placed the chairs in front of the tents, organized by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head, not through the official door,” Kavardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership will bring a lot of necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will vote for it, because more than 80% of our citizens represent the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He noted that the result “yes” will be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research of Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters will take part in the referendum, which is below the necessary figure.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV channel Telma, 57% of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since the beginning of its work in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes all of Brighton's defense and shoots a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling passed the defense of Brighton and brought Manchester City a 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker received a passport in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three defenders of Brighton and found himself in the open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four green ones.
He bypassed one defender, then ran several more on the edge of the penalty "Briton".
Then he made a pass to the left, seeing Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch on the penalty to give the ball back to Aguero, who with his right butt kicked him to the right side of the gate, defeating goalkeeper "Briton" Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some problems with his legs,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at this point.”
But the initial advantage of the sky-blue in this match of the Premier League was provided by Sterling.
This goal took place in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank of Leroy Sane.
Leroy made a few touches and then made a pass to Sterling in the direction of the far bar.
Forward sky-blues left the ball in the gate just before he skipped the border.
City will meet Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rain-Neckar-Arena stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Chercer wants to pick up points in "Roxis"
Since the Washington Nationals team came out of playoffs, there was no significant reason to wait for another start.
But the rival Chercer hopes to go out on a pitter hill on Sunday in a match against Colorado Rockies, provided that Rockies will still have difficulties with the exit to the playoffs. Now Rockies for one game ahead of Lagos.
"Roxis" at least have a wild card for a 5-2 win over "Nashionals" on Friday night, but still aim to secure the title of the first division.
“Despite the fact that we’re playing for nothing, at least we’ll be able to leave the ball knowing how the spectators are doing here in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I’ve seen all year.
Why wouldn’t I want to take part in this fight?
"Nashionals" will announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but it is reported that they are leaning toward what will be a Shercer.
Chercer, for whom it will be the 34th start, held a pitching session on Thursday and can play on Sunday, his usual weekend.
Washington's right has a score of 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts at 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's Meetings in West Virginia
The president ran to recall the situation around his candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the appearance of Republican supporters in the mid-term elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be put on the map in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
It’s one of the big, big ones — I don’t run, but I really run, so I fight for great candidates wherever I can,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see what’s happening right now.
And they're hard-wired to return power, using any means, you see stupidity, cowardice.
They don’t care who they suffer from, who they need to go through to get power and control, they want power and control, we’re not going to give them.”
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is “to resist and hinder.”
“And you’ve seen this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil and mean, disgusting and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, naming Democratic Senator Diane Fainstein by name, prompting the audience to shout out dissatisfaction.
“Do you remember her answer?
You gave me a document?
Uh-oh, what?
No, no, no, no, I’m waiting — it was a really bad language of bodyguards — the worst language of bodyguards I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a large church.
It is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the “Momentum” activists in my local party voted to convict me, it almost didn’t come as a surprise.
In the end, I am the last of those Labour Members of Parliament who have been told that they are not happy, and that is because we are expressing our opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, was put on almost the same page because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was convicted of not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. These issues are ironically similar to those on which Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
A statement from the Nottingham East Labour Party on Friday said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labour Party were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a completely different tone, and the promise of a "more benevolent, softer" policy has long been forgotten if it was ever started to be fulfilled.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the Labour Party does not allow excellent views and every opinion is assessed from the standpoint of whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader. Colleagues, with whom I had previously seemed to have similar political views, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take a position with which I would never have agreed, no matter what.
Whenever I speak in public — and it doesn’t matter what I say — this is followed by a series of attacks on social networks with calls for a recall, a condemnation of the centre’s politics, they tell me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And that’s not just my experience.
I know that I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I’m directed at are usually political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and decisiveness of those colleagues who daily face the tides of sexist or racist attacks, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with every movement of “unbelief” or change in the rules of selection the party shrinks.
During the last two years I received a lot of advice. I was called not to hang out, not to speak out so loudly that “everything was fine” with me.
But I didn’t come to politics.
I joined the Laborists 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because because of the lack of attention on the part of the Tetcher government, my class in high school has literally deteriorated, since then I seek to improve the quality of public services for those who need them the most, be it a local councilman.
I’ve never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been bothered by my political views and disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who have contributed to Friday’s events, I want to say only one thing: in the circumstances when the country steps to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my lazy loyalty.
In fact, I have another message, but not for Notingem’s “Momentum”, but for my constituents, as members of the Labour Party, and not: I am proud of what I serve you, and I promise that no threats will deter me and no longer be political.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Air Rises Up
The last two attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but, without a doubt, "Ayr" deserved a triumph in today's great entertainment match of the Premiership of Scotland.
Now they're leading the table, it's the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the excellent defense and improved ability to use the chances gives the owners and coach Peter Merci the full right to be satisfied.
“So far we’ve been testing our games, and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose commented: “I give the proper Air, they used the chances better than we did.”
The 14th-minute attempt by Grant Anderson, by Frazier Klimo, led the Air forward, but a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Gus, published by the Verriors, allowed the Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Nuggow.
Klimo strengthened the leadership of "Air" with the help of a penalty and just before the break made and implemented a solo attempt, which gave an account of 17-5 in favor of "Air"
But the Melrose well started the second time, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a prolonged delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, which was taken out of the field on his nose, and from the restart "Air" broke forward with the help of the attempt by Stafford McDowell, which was implemented by Klimo.
Air captain Blair McFarson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another player to pay for an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin under fierce pressure.
The hosts returned, however, when Struan Hatchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Klimo without a ball from the penalty area line, McFarson made a tachdown behind the Air Mall.
Klimo carried out an attempt he made almost every time after the restart, after which Kyle Rowe received a punch from David Armstrong into the box and sent flanker Gregor Henry to the fifth try of the master team.
It seems, the star of the series "All Still a Game" is set for a new career in the restaurant sphere
It seems that the star of the series "All Still Play" Ford Kiran is set for a new career in hospitality. This conclusion can be made after it became known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, a script he writes to and in which he shoots with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duet has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning a life after Craigling.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan wants to enter Glasgow’s “promising restaurant business.”
“Our Sea”: Bolivia’s inland waterway hopes the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the equipped fleet headquarters in La Paz.
The public buildings hang the ocean-blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: “Our sea is right.
We have to get him back.”
In Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coastline that left Chile in the bloody 19th century conflict due to natural resources, and there is also a desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are now, perhaps, the strongest in recent decades, as Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of consideration of the case.
“In Bolivia, there is an impulse, there is a spirit of unity and calmness and, of course, it expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the announcement of the decision of the ICU on large screens all over the country. They hope that the tribunal in The Hague will make a decision in favor of Bolivia, that after decades of intense talks Chile will have to negotiate.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his re-election next year, also lays great hopes for a decision to be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if this happens, little will change.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to assign Chilean territory and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the decision of the ICU, taken only six months after the final arguments were made, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
The Bolivian case has not progressed, the last four years could have contributed to the rejection back.
“The question of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
The military rhetoric of Morales shattered the remnants of Chilean kindness, she assumed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, did not agree that the court’s decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will receive “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to put an end to 139 years of differences, receiving mutual benefit,” he said.
Calsadia also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as a political militia.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
This decision is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if it can’t trust the US
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington, D.C.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has come to a deaf corner more than three months after a Singapore summit with Kim Jong-un.
Ri says the belief that continuing sanctions and opposing the U.S. declaration of the end of the Korean War will once put North Korea on its knees is an “unfulfilled dream.”
Washington is afraid to take a declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps to disarm it.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is seriously turning down its arsenal, which the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
On the Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend of massive headwear, which is already straight on the main streets of your city
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you have found what you need.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown demonstrated a number of eccentric oversea-style headwear from the spring-summer 2019 collection on the podiums of the brilliant Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have captivated Instagram this summer, and the named designers have already sent their captivating creations outside the podium.
Valentino was distinguished by an extravagant beige hat with wide decorated feathers of fields, which closed the heads of the models.
Among other oversea accessories, they are decorated with precious stones of caviar, sage hats and even pineapple hats, but they are not for keeping your head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated a range of original masks – very early in front of Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had sewn lips and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of the creations resembled underwater swimming equipment with pipes and goggles, the other looked like a slice of ice cream that melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you are in luck.
Stylists say that huge hats can come out on the main streets of your city.
Oversea hats entered fashion thanks to "La Bombi", a straw hat with a field width of sixty centimeters, which was seen on all: from Rihanna to Emily Ratazhkovski.
The cult brand, which stands behind a very impractical hat, which could be seen everywhere in social networks, gave the world another creation: a straw-shaped beach bag almost the size of a model in a swimsuit that carried it.
A bag of yellow-red raffia with a birch raffia and a white leather handle was the central element of the La Riviera spring-summer 2019 collection of the Jacquemus brand at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “Next summer I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets of the city, because the influence of the designer is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversea axes.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is a must for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland support high standards of education, and in 2018 great results of exams were again obtained, which are complemented by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other fields.
These schools, which are attended by over 30,000 students across Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SSC). They aim to provide the best level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career, as well as to make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in the language he understands, he perceives it with his mind.
If you talk to her in her native language, she perceives it with her heart.”
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t just use English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year’s exams, we see that independent language schools are leading in the rankings of subjects with the best grades.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received a higher score of A.
The data, collected in 74 schools of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that 72% of students received a higher score of A from Chinese, and 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future. . . .
Now languages as a subject of choice are taught in the same way as NTIM subjects (science, engineering, engineering and mathematics), within the framework of independent school programs and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17% of the reasons why employers can’t close jobs are related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more necessary when preparing young people for future careers.
As more and more promising positions require knowledge of languages, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if someone has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because it is a lifelong skill.
The possibility of direct communication with people from other countries automatically gives a person who has multiple languages a preference over the competitors.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% couldn’t speak a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a bipartisan percentage of people (15%).
That’s why investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will provide children with more chances of finding a full-time job.
In Scotland, each school will learn its own language.
Some schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most important for the UK from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, it will always be possible to choose several languages to study them with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools are trying to create a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to achieve success regardless of what has prepared them for the future.
Now it can not be denied that in the international business environment languages continue to have a vital importance for the future country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered “the habits of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut with the Lakers in San Diego
Fans who want to see LeBron James’ first start for the Los Angeles Lakers were almost expected.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the first pre-season game against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is not yet decided.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games of the pre-season schedule of the Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump's Meetings in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of pre-election rallies today from the city of Wiling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five scheduled for next week's Trump rallies, including rallies in the friendly-minded states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidacy he proposed to the Supreme Court is postponed, and Trump seeks to form support for the upcoming mid-term elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after a vote in November.
What time will be Trump’s tonight meeting in West Virginia and how to watch it on the Internet?
Trump's meeting in Willingen, West Virginia scheduled for 19 hours east of time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to recall the tense hearings that took place this week about a candidate for Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court, who is accused of sexual harassment, and about the postponement of the Senate vote for a week while the investigation continues.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans with gaining popularity before the elections in November.
Trump’s representatives said the five rallies next week are aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
“Control over Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible as the tense campaign season is nearing,” a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to name his name told Reuters.
Fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, may attend the scheduled meeting at the Vesbank Arena in the city of Willing today, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's visit will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the last month, a state in which he garnered more than 40% of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrice, whose rating is behind the results of the polls.
“It’s not good for Morrissey that the president is coming to raise his rating in the polls,” Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team set to fight and full of hope on the eve of Sunday singles
After three sessions, which ended in a one-sided victory, afternoon Saturday forts can become exactly what this Ryder Cup lacked.
The emergency capital of the impulse is a completely invented sports concept, in which the players really believe, especially in such competitions.
So when are they going to say that the impulse works?
“They were ahead by six points, and now by four, so I think we’re taking it a little bit like an impulse,” Spitt said as he left.
Europe has a preference, of course, for four points ahead and another twelve in the game.
Americans, as Spit says, feel a bit of wind in their windows, as well as a lot of encouragement, not least the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each earned three points out of four.
Sleeping with his murderous blows from the site to the grin shows an example.
These thundering cheers of the celebration became louder as he continued his round to make a decisive pact and leveled the score in the fourth match after he and Thomas put on two points.
His patent, which allowed them to win a match on the 15th of the moon, met with a similar cry, one that tells you that the American team doesn’t seem to be.
“You really just have to try very hard and worry about your own match,” Spitt said.
This is all that each of these players has left now.
18 months to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days — Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual, but charming couple from Europe has four out of four and can not make mistakes.
The Molivud were the only couple who did not make the gods on Saturday after lunch, they also managed to avoid the gods in the morning on Saturday and after lunch on Friday and on the last nine lunches on Friday morning.
This run and how their energy seems to flow to this turbulent crowd and back, makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Flitwood or Molinari to secure a potential victory for the Europeans when the Nationals win.
It is desirable to both at the same time on different lunches.
However, talking about the triumph of Europeans is still early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson broke up with Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the hero of the mornings when he was in a relationship with Alex Noren.
One god and two dolls on the first nine holes led the Spanish and the Swedes to the hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It is very interesting to observe the phorbols and forsomas closely because of the interaction between the participants of the pair, because of the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and also interesting to observe how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe is playing better as a team so far and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this session of strengths has also shown that the U.S. team intends to fight for what some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe leads with a 10-6 score on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the European Ryder Cup, Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturdays forbols and forsoms it overtakes the United States with a score of 10-6.
Inspired duo Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the late Tiger Woods, and now at Le Golf National they have four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to return the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the U.S. team in the mornings with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. made more resistance in the forsoms and won two matches, but were unable to reduce the gap.
Team Jim Furyk needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to save the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Mollinari (along with "Mollivud") are only the second pair to score four points in the first four matches in the history of Raab Kubka.
Having broken up Woods and Patrick Reed in the squabble, they teamed up to beat the fuzzy Woods and rookie American Brayson Deshambo with an even more powerful 5ta4.
Woods, who pulled out two matches on Saturday, showed a random burst of genius, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in phorbols and forsoms and seven matches in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the mornings, returned to partner Henry Stanson in the forsoms to get a 2ta1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coepka, who are the first and third in the world rankings.
Europe has not been able to do everything in its own way on this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris.
Three major winners, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, set the standard for Americans on Saturday with their two points.
They won a decisive 2ta1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Poulter in the forts and later defeated Poulter and Rory McClroy with a 4ta3 score in the forts, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returned with a four-point deficit in the singles, although Furik's team needed nothing to save the trophy.
However, after the second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it is not in their power.
North Korea says it will not “in any case” arm itself unilaterally without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions deepens distrust of the United States, and that under such circumstances the country will in no way be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that last year North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill", such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of a nuclear test site and the decommissioning of nuclear weapons.
“However, we do not see a corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
And although Ree repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s opposition to the “stage” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for the gradual steps, his statement proved important that the ploy did not deviate in it.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the current U.S. president and North Korea’s leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for a “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”
North Korea aspires to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to weaken tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on “denuclearization first” and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals forcefully, and even denies the “announcement of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“To think that sanctions can put us on our knees is an unfulfilled dream of those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the issue of denuclearization were to be South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean subcontinent would not be possible.”
Despite this, the tone of Ri’s speech was sharply different from that of last year when he told the General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles on the mainland of the U.S. was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “chochin” himself.
This year at the UN, Trump, who threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea last year, praised Kim for the courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still much more to be done and the sanctions should remain in place.
On Wednesday, Trump noted that he does not set a time frame for this: “It will take two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Implementation of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and relentlessly until we see complete, final, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unilaterally increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block the financing of Pyongyang’s nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri in the corridors of the UN General Assembly and then said that next month he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was a failure.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for “gangster demands.”
During a meeting with the Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States takes “appropriate measures”.
He said that, according to Kim, he needed “appropriate measures” are security assurances Trump promised in Singapore, and steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year provided all of its students with more sleep. It is an attempt to fight the growing culture of cirrhosis of learning all night after a caffeine incinerated.
The teacher found that the number one university students in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, developed a course that, in his opinion, is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start the course after speaking with a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end, a girl came up to him and said, “Why am I being told this now, on the last course?”
“She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” a teacher from The Telegraph said.
In the course, which was first introduced this year, students explain the basics of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sporting results, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s medical services, said the university decided to take a course after it was discovered that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a room in a dormitory, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deficits on sports performance, as well as the importance of sleep-related routines.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the consequences of smoking cigarettes for health,” added Professor Chaser.
The culture of pride for “sleeping all night” still exists, he added, and also noted that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
Adequate good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even with a set of excess weight, because sleep deprivation translates the brain into a mode of hunger that causes constant physical hunger.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaser develop a course after enrolling in one of his other courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to appeal to all postgraduates with a request to pass a similar training program before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommends that students put a reminder to sleep, as well as put an alarm clock and be aware of the harmful influence of “blue light”, which is radiated by electronic screens and LED lamps and can disrupt the circadian rhythm that occurs.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Menga's goal upset the boys Gerard
The Rangers have suffered another attack of outbound distress: the hit of Dolly Menga brought the disparate team of Steven Gerard a 1-0 defeat from Livingston.
The team of "Aibrox" wanted to win their first victory in the away match after the February triumph over "St. Johnston" with a score of 4-1, but the team of Harry Holt defeated Gerard II as manager of 18 games.
Menga shot seven minutes before the break, and the composition of the Rangers, which lacked inspiration, did not look as if it could equalize the bill.
Now the Rangers have dropped to sixth position, and the Livingstons have risen to third, and only the Hibernians are ahead of them by the difference of the balls.
In addition, the Rangers may experience another inconvenience, as the liner Kalum Spence was forced to deal with a head injury after being thrown out of the guest sector by an object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team, which once passed the Ayr in the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
And Holt released the same composition "Lewis 11", which took one point in "Harts" last week, and was fascinated by how his formidable guys pushed rivals at every step.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but the Livingstons worked more with the ball they received.
They were supposed to shoot just two minutes later in the game, when Menga's first pass into the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit the gates of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed this big chance by sending the ball through the gate.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free kick has caught the skipper Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithou has hit the back bar
The Rangers really got control, but in the last third there was more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he should get the right to a penalty mark a quarter of an hour after a clash with Stephen Lowless, but the referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers managed to make only two shots at the gates in the first half, but the former goalkeeper Liam Kelly hit the head of Lassana Kulibali and Ovie Ejaria's calm shot almost didn't bother.
And while Levinstone’s 34-minute goal may have contradicted the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it only with their hard work.
The Rangers couldn’t cope with Jacobs’ predicament again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly picked Meng for a simple finish.
In the break, Gerard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the winger broke into Morelos, but the striking Kelly stuck out of his line to block him.
However, “Livingston” continued to force guests to play exactly the game they liked when Litho and Halkett made one long pass after another.
Holt's team was able to improve the result in the final stages, but McGregor resisted Jacobs well before Litgow struck from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for the Rangers, made another late application for a penalty when he faced Jacobs, but Thompson turned his eyes away again.
Almanacs: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and time is running out... in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that over time evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film The Coronado Bells with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play dubiously in the form of books.
Man: “What is it at all?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter that is used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
“When you wear these headphones, you can really hear how radioactivity in minerals affects atoms,” he said.
Evans: “Well, she’s really shaking right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method involves the removal of immune cells in the patient and their change in the laboratory
Then these cells are able to "see" proteins, which is common to many types of cancer. Next, these cells re-introduce the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory in such a way that these cells can “see” common to many types of protein cancer (HER2), and further reintroduction of these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute at Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer,” he explained.
A similar approach, which consists in excreting immune cells in patients and "learning" them to target cancer cells, worked in the treatment of one of the types of leukemia.
After appearing in the studio of the SNL show in baseball MAGA Kanye West kicked out with a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
What caused the negative reaction of the audience?
Viewers at the SNL show's studio (Saturday Night Live) scoured Cannes after his lavish performance, during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town in a baseball game titled "Let's Return to America's Former Glory" he blew up a tirade in which he criticized Democrats, and again declared his support for Trump.
“Often during the conversation, white people ask me, ‘How do you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch by Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Cavano's testimony he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in a lawsuit filed by Christine Blaise Ford about sexual assault.
Although Vesta’s speech was not broadcast live, the video with his tirade was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule Vesta by posting this post.
The West also complained to the audience that behind the scenes there was an unpleasant situation with him due to the main cleaning.
As reported by the Washington Examiner, West stated: “When I was behind bars, I was rude.
I was told, "Don't go to the audience in this baseball."
They got away with me!
And then they tell me I’m in a place where the oppressed are silent.”
The news continued: “Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are silent? I will wear my superman baseball shirt, because so no one will be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love.”
According to Variety, his comments caused a negative reaction of the audience in the hall at least twice, and the actors of the show SNL looked lost. One of the viewers said: "The studio was dominated by dead silence".
Vesta was last minute asked to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before airing.
West has caused many surprises by performing the song I Love It (I Love It) in a Perrier bottle of water suit.
Vesta supported the head of the conservative organization TPUSA Kendes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “One of the most courageous: THANK YOU FOR WHAT THE NATOVPU’S BENEFITS ARE.”
In a tweet, Karen Hunter, the show’s lead singer, said the West “is who it is, and it’s just great.”
“Yet I will not reward it (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his ‘art’), who, in my opinion, professes and throws out an ideology that harms my community.
He is a free man.
“Just like us,” she added.
Prior to his appearance on the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: now he is "the one who was formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first performer to change his name. He follows the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Buffy and P. Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg had previously been known as Snoop Lyon, and, as is known, the music legend of the last decades, the Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then became an "Artist, formerly known as the Prince".

Star of the series "Game of Thrones" Kit Herrington condemns the idealization of brutality
Kit Herrington became famous for his role as a warrior with the sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones" produced by HBO.
However, the 31-year-old actor has spoken out condemning the stereotype of the hero-macho, claiming that because of such heroes on the screens of young guys often it seems that they must become cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that, in his opinion, "something went wrong", and asked how to solve the problem of idealizing brutality in the age of popularity hashtag #MeTo (#yet, #yet, etc.).
Cat, who recently married her colleague on Game of Thrones, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, noted that he was "quite decisive" in his determination to deal with the problem.
“I’m quite determined at the moment. When did we get on the slippery path of idealization of brutality?” – he asked.
“Why do we teach future men if we look at their growing up because of the prism of the problem we see now?”
Cat believes that television is partly responsible for the popularization of brutality because of the image of extremely brave heroes.
He continued: “What is natural, and what are we planted?
Why does television and the street teach that young boys feel the pressure to be such men?
In my opinion, today’s really important question is “How do we change that?”
After all, it’s obvious that the young guys have fallen off the right path.”
In the interview, he also noted that he will not be filming in any of the sequels and sequels of "Game of Thrones" after finishing the show next summer, as "it's already over with battles and horses".
From November, Kit will play in the play "The True West" by Sam Shepard – stories about the filmmaker and his brother-in-law.
As the actor recently admitted, he respects meeting his wife Rose the best he has received from participating in the series "Game of Thrones".
"During the filming of this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and defined my future life," Kit said.
In the fantasy series, which received the Emmy Awards, Rose played Igritt – the love of the hero Gerington John Snow.
The couple visited in June 2018. The ceremony was held on the territory of the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces sharp growth of 14% in the number of new cases of the disease
China has reported a sharp increase of 14% in the number of citizens with HIV and AIDS.
According to the representatives of the health authorities, in total there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases of the disease were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted through the genital tract, which indicates a change in the past trend.
For a long time, in some regions of China, HIV quickly spread through infected blood during transfusions.
However, as official representatives of health care bodies said during the conference held in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China grew by 100,000 people.
Transmitting HIV by sex on time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to the study, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men are subsequently married to women due to the dominance in the country of conservative values.
Transmission of the disease in most cases occurs as a result of improper use of the means of protection during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to medicines from HIV, seeing in this way a partial solution to the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking data from Republican senators to her network as a staff member and exposes sharp criticism of “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters condemned vocal statements that one of her staff posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claims that these statements spread to "ultra-right" political observers and websites.
“A lie, a lie, and then even more ugly lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch of Utah.
The data appeared on the network on Thursday. They were placed by an unknown person from the Capitol during hearings in the Senate Commission on charges of unlawful acts of a sexual nature, filed against Brett Kavanaugh, a U.S. candidate for the position of Judge Verkhov.
The leak came some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, there was information that the IP address of the source of the leak was linked to the Waters office and was able to find the data of its employee.
“These baseless assertions are absolutely untrue, they don’t correspond to reality,” Waters continued.
“The employee of my office, whose personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fabricated and false statements, has nothing to do with the outcome of this information.
These baseless assertions are absolutely untrue, they do not correspond to reality.”
Waters's statement was quickly criticized on the network, including former White House press secretary Ari Flaisser.
“This denial is full of anger,” wrote Flaischer.
“This suggests that with this character she cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not be held in contempt.
He should not ask about the motives of the accused.
He must remain calm and inviolable.”
It seems that Flasher paralleled Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry during Thursday’s hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is campaigning to take the place of Waters in the interim election, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“This is so news, if everything is really true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters noted that her office had already reported "relevant state authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false statements."
“We will do everything we can to find the culprits,” she continued, “and they have responded to the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees.”
Review of the film "Agent Johnny Inglesh: A New Mission" – a passing parody for spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson
It has already become a good tradition to look for meaning in every new British film inspired by Brexit. They are also in the new part of a series of comedy parodies about Johnny Inglish. The first film called "Johnny Inglish" came out on the screen in the spring of 2003
Will there be a ridiculously ironic self-satisfaction with what we are inferior to the nation’s new export potential?
In one way or another, Johnny Inglis, with his moving face and drooping eyes, was given the opportunity to make a mess for the second time, with his name more than anything else pointing to the fact that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
As you know, Johnny is a hilarious secret agent, in which, despite his strange attempts to be gallant and charming, is a little bit of Inspector Cluzo, a little bit of Mr. Bina and a lot of things – from the guy who played "the violin" from the melody
The character's role model is also a traveler and a mystery of the international scale, which has always been left behind by the disorder that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's long-forgotten television commercial.
In the last film about Johnny English, there are a few good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Inglis approached the helicopter in the knight's armor, and the blades of a screw were swirling around his neck.
In the film, Atkinson's talent is well revealed to arrange a buffoonade, however, the humor is transient, and at some points it is too much, especially when compared to "serious" film brands, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission is also impossible", one of the "ingredi"
The impression is that jokes are intended for children rather than adults, and I don’t think the stupid attacks that happen to Johnny English are as inventive and thoughtful as Atkinson’s inferences in any movies about Bina.
As always, the film begins with the fact that there was a serious threat over the UK.
In the British super-secret spy network, a hacker infiltrates and reveals the names of all field agents, which became a total surprise for the acting agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an episodic role in the film).
This proved to be the last drop for the prime minister – a proud person who has already been subjected to devastating criticism and is in a deep depression due to the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to convey the best image she had conjured up by Theresa May, however, she did not hesitate.
Intelligence officials informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she should be attracted to someone from the abductees.
The choice falls on the ruthless Johnny Inglesh, who now works as a teacher at some super-fashion institution and unofficially teaches children operative work undercover (in this part with the spy "school of the year" English for teenagers was a bit of a joke).
The English are quickly taken to Whitehall for a short briefing, where he reunites with his long-suffering friend, Buff, whom Ben Miller once again plays.
Baff is now married to the captain of the submarine (the role of an exalted weary person does not quite correspond to the talent of Vicki Pepperdin).
So, when everything in her Majesty's Secret Service went scurvy, "Betman and Robin" return to the line and unexpectedly meet the fatal woman Ophelia Pistolevsky, played by Olga Kurilenko.
And at this time, the prime minister falls under the spell of a charismatic billionaire, who has earned his fortune in the field of technology and technology and claims that he can solve the problem with the British network, the evil Jason Walt, played by Lexie Dawg.
Inglish and Baf go on a trip and again go to their ridiculous outings: overdressed officers they make fire in a chic French restaurant; next they sow chaos, illegally going abroad on the luxury outposts;
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but with his kindness and madness, he kind of resembles a movie for children.
A passing film.
As with watching other films about Johnny Inglish, I asked myself the same question: Can the British film industry not offer Rowena Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
The Labour Party has rejected the plan, according to which the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary in five days.
The Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, is set to discuss a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, but will receive a salary in five days.
It is reported that the party wants to oblige the managers of companies to transfer funds saved as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence, to employees, giving them an additional weekend.
Thus, the workers will have a three-day weekend and at the same time bring home the same salary.
According to the sources, this idea will correspond to the party’s economic program and direct the country’s resources to support the working class.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved at the British Congress of Trade Unions. It is seen that in this way, workers will be able to benefit from a change in the general economic situation.
A source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Not everything will change in one night, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the party’s approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour was not the first to accept such an idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week even during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at the moment approve of such a desire.
The Labour Party spokesman said: “The political agenda of the party does not provide for the introduction of a four-day working week, so now we are not considering this idea.”
“Dark” Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at last week’s Labour Party pre-election meeting.
Mr. MacDonnell said he was set to take back power from the “infinite directors” of municipal enterprises and “scooters.”
The Chancellor’s “shadow” plan also means that the shareholders of the water supply companies may not get all their share of capital if the Labour government implements “deductions” on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also reaffirmed his intention to involve workers in the management of companies and to create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of the usual shares of private sector firms to workers who expect annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy tell the show 60 Minutes (60 minutes), whether the investigation into the Kavanaugh case, led by the FBI, can change their mind
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, which is led by the FBI, the final vote for his appointment to the post of Judge of the Supreme Court has been postponed at least a week. There is a question of whether the results of the Republican senators will continue and continue to succeed in the basement.
In the Sunday show 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
During the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I phoned him after everything happened and the charge came up, asking him, “Did you really do this?”
He was determined, uncompromising, uncompromising.”
It seems that Graham’s opinion will not change anything anymore.
"I believe that the prosecution of Kavanaugh is a provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett strongly denied everything," Graham said, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
And everyone she calls can't confirm it under the oath.
This happened 36 years ago.
I don’t know what can change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival – an annual event in the music world with an astonishing number of star performers and at least a devastating mission – to overcome poverty all over the world.
During the seventh Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will juggle the Great Square of the Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the true purpose of the festival – the organizers of the 20th edition of the festival – the organizers of the festival – the organizers of the festival.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international public organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (if only you do not want to pay a VIP ticket), visitors must perform a number of tasks or "actions", how-to take to study in a volunteer project, write an email to the world leader, make a phone call or call
So is there any results already, because the goal of the organizers of the Global Citizen is 12 years away?
Is it really an idea to reward for doing a free concert – a brilliant way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clitivism” when people feel that something is really changing by signing an e-petition or by making a publication in Ts.
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million “acts” of their supporters, aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to declare planned financial allocations and programs worth more than $37 billion, which by 2030 will help change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited as an example the results of its activities 390 financial obligations and public statements, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
According to the group, the funds provided have already directly impacted the lives of approximately 649 million people around the world.
Among the main financial obligations you can mention the fund The Power of Nutrition, which is territorially related to the UK. As part of the project, investors and implementers took on the obligation "to help children grow" and promised not to give more money to Rwandan farmers.
"With the support of the UK government, mesenteries, governments of other countries and citizens of the world, like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a minor fact of history," said Tracy Ullman, a spokeswoman for The Power of Nutrition organization, in a speech to the public.
The organisation also said that after 5,000 “actions” that called for improved maternal and child nutrition, the UK government announced the allocation of funds for The Power of Nutrition project, aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on your website “Why do you think you will be able to overcome extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen said: “It’s a long and hard road, so sometimes we’ll fall and we’ll fail.
However, as participants of the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements towards us, we will achieve success because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are just some of the star performers who will perform at the New York Festival this year, and will be hosted by Deborah Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
The interior minister said the U.S. could use naval forces for “blockage” to prevent the export of Russian energy resources.
According to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted in the Washington Examiner, “if necessary” Washington can appeal with the help of naval forces to prevent the release of Russian energy resources to markets, including markets in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russia’s participation in the conflict in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a reason to explore new energy markets.
“I think they are in the Middle East because they want to be an intermediary in the energy trade, as they are already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means of solving the problem.
“Thanks to U.S. naval forces, it can provide free passage by sea and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, which was held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that positions itself as “the voice of every consumer” in the United States.
He then compared the approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they were in fact similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we effectively use energy resources and replace them with alternatives," he said, calling Russia "unilaterally developed", as its economy depends on the energy resources of the mine.
While these statements were lulled, the Trump administration set the goal of increasing the export of compressed natural gas to Europe, squeezing Russian-origin energy from the market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
For this purpose, Trump administration officials and President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince the German government to abandon the "inappropriate" project of construction of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the gas pipeline "North Stream 2", the cost of which is 11 billion dollars and which will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we share the view that energy resources cannot be a tool of pressure and the consumer should have the opportunity to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Oleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry, who was in Moscow last week.
The U.S. position has provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which has confirmed its support for the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I don’t like it when a third country interferes in our energy supplies,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with the Russian President.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren "seriously thinks" about running for president in 2020
Massachusetts State Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she was "seriously thinking" about running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting with the public in Goliok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of running for office.
As reported by The Hill Warren, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and set up a government, and there has to be a woman at his head.”
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider putting my candidacy to the presidency.”
During a meeting with the public, Warren expressed her assessment of Donald Trump’s presidency, saying that he “leads his country not in that direction.
“I’m extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was frank, criticizing Trump and offered him a candidacy for the post of Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: “...undoubtedly, before the FBI vote, it has to conduct an investigation.”
However, according to the results of a poll released on Friday, the majority of Warren voters do not believe that she should run in 2020.
According to the results of a poll conducted jointly by the Center for Political Research at the University of Saffolka and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of potential Massachusetts voters opposed the senator’s candidacy.
Thirty-two percent supported the withdrawal.
The results of the survey proved that the former governor Deval Patrick is using more support. For his potential appointment to the office of President, 38%, versus – 48%.
During the discussions, the candidates of other well-known Democrats, who can run in 2020, are also named former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont State Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Paylin recalls Trek Paylin's PTSD during a rally in support of Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Trek Paylin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and the incident took place on Monday night.
"What my son is going through now, what he is going through after his return, can only understand other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and other health problems, with which our soldiers are returning home," she told the participants of the meeting on the floor.
Paylin called Trey's arrest "a problem that no one is paying attention to" and said that her son and other war veterans "return home not the way they used to be, tougher, and want to know if they respect what their husbands and wives have done here.
According to the spokesman of the city police department, Dan Bennett, Trek was arrested on Monday in the town of Vasily, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on women, as well as the fact that he had prevented the reported rape.
18 States and Districts of Colombia Support Complaints of Homeland Security Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the appeal of the new U.S. policy, according to which victims of gang-rape and domestic violence are denied refugee status.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district sent an analytical note from a court consultant to Washington to support an appeal that needs a shelter and has appealed in court for the aforementioned policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case at the request of the American Civil Rights Union, in which the federal policy is challenged and which was filed in August, is not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his cruel gangsters" beat her, but U.S. officials refused her when she asked for a shelter on July 20.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
State prosecutors backing Grace’s lawsuit said residents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (refugees often seek asylum in the U.S.) often face such serious problems as banditry and domestic violence.
The new policy of granting refugee status cancels the decision of the Appeals Council on immigration in 2014, according to which immigrants without documents that escaped from domestic violence could request asylums.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, General Carl Reisin, said in his speech on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international laws.”
“Federal law requires that the decision on the application for refugee status be based on consideration of the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement, and the ban violates this principle,” the court’s advisory notes.
In an analytical note, prosecutors argue that a policy that bans immigrants from entering the U.S. would harm the country’s economy, as they could potentially become entrepreneurs and “fill in the necessary labor resources.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued an order for immigration judges, which said they could no longer provide refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
"The guardianship is granted to those persons who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial affiliation, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views," Seshnie said during the presentation of the poll.
Providing shelter was never intended to solve all the inconveniences, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers are desperately trying to find those who were left alive, while the number of dead in Pal has doubled.
For those who are still alive, the situation is getting worse.
“The situation is very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with a fever in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, the ambulance brings the body.
There is not enough clean water.”
Some residents return to their destroyed homes, taking over the flooded dwellings, trying to save what they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged as a result of the earthquake, whose strength was 7.5 points on the Richter scale, were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Heris with a fractured back and shoulder, rest near the building of the Pal's Army Hospital, where patients are provided with open-air assistance through constant repeated sneezing.
His eyes were filled with tears as he remembered how a strong postage stamped a hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for rescue.
It seems to me that I was stuck in the middle of the wall,” Geris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife begging for help, and then I was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Making Psychological Pressure” With “Advertising Containing Propaganda”
A week after the state-run Chinese newspaper placed advertising material on four pages of the U.S. daily newspaper about the mutual benefit of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register – the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa after accusing China of trying to influence the election to Congress, which will take place on November 6.
According to Reuters officials in the United States, Trump’s statements, in which he accuses Beijing of trying to interfere in the U.S. election, mean a new phase of escalation by Washington, whose goal is pressure on China.
While foreign governments can place advertising to boost trade, there is an escalation of the trade war between Beijing and Washington, in which they have already raised the import duty.
According to experts from China and the U.S., at the beginning of this war, the imposition of repressive tariffs in China had little to do with striking exporters from states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Brenstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brensted wrote in the column of the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, “reinforces pressure by publishing advertising containing propaganda in our independent press.”
“To spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American people’s tradition of freedom of speech and press independence by placing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Brensted wrote.
"On the contrary, on the street signs here, in Beijing, you will find only the individual voices of the incognitive. Here you will not see a true reflection of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of development of the Chinese economy, which can cause a snooze
He also added that "one of the most important Chinese editions offered to publish" his article, but did not name which one.
Analysts warn that the failure of the Kavanaugh Republicans to set up women-electors against themselves before the midterm elections
Since many well-known Republicans support and defend the candidate for the post of Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh after he has been charged with several counts of sexual harassment, analysts warn that this may not cause a rebuttal.
There is a lot of passion around this situation, and most Republicans publicly say they would like to go to the polls.
Such things cannot then simply be played back,” Grant Riger, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill in an interview on Saturday.
Roger expressed doubts that the FBI investigation, at which Senator Jeff Fleck (a Republican from Arizona) began to insist at the last minute, would be enough to calm down the angry voters.
As reported by the Washington, D.C., the chief advisor and spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn (Go ahead) Catherine Jean-Perrier said on Friday: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget about it in vain.
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protesters chanted "Letter is approaching!" during a demonstration in the Juridical Committee, when Republicans decided to move to the approval of Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Frytiz.
In an interview with the news website Steve Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, said: “People will be extremely interested and motivated.”
“They say it is now, and it is true.
However, motivation may increase, especially in women-electors 18-29 years of age with prejudice, which have not yet been determined and often do not vote if they do not like the president.”
Even before Ford gave evidence in connection with the candidate’s allegations of being a judge of the Supreme Court in a sexual crime, analysts predicted the voters’ negative reaction if Republicans insist on approval.
As NBC News reported earlier this week, former head of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said: “This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party.”
As noted in an interview with the news channel, the director of Priorities USA (the group that helps the Democrats in the election campaign) Guy Cecil, "it is not a matter of voting for the committee, final voting or the fact that Kavanaugh was on the run, and that he was on the run, and that Kavanaugh was on the run.
However, the opinions of Americans about whose testimony to believe, Ford or Kavanaugh, have been divided. Ford has a little more support.
According to a new survey from YouGov, 41% of respondents believe or rather believe Ford's testimony, while Kavanaugh's testimony believes or rather believes 35% of respondents.
In addition, 38% of respondents noted that, in their opinion, Kavanaugh gave or most likely gave false evidence, while 30% of respondents said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is conducting an investigation into the charges filed by Ford and another instigator, Deborah Ramirez, after pressure from the FBI.
Last week, Ford gave evidence under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee about how Kavanaugh attacked her while she was in a state of alcoholic suspense when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez said that the candidate for the post of Supreme Court judge showed her his genitalia at a party during their studies at the University of Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world's Internet plans to launch a "new Internet" to create competition between Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global Internet, is launching a new startup to create competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the world of technology legend, Inrupt, is the development of a platform with open source Solid, the idea of which belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store the data and whom to give access to that or other information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
It's a historic moment."
Solid technology is used in the application, which will allow users to create a "personal online data storage" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of current affairs, calendars, audio recordings library, and other tools for your own use and work.
It’s like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify in one browser at a time.
The unique feature of this personal online data storage is that it fully meets the needs of the user, who can access any information.
The company calls it “the expansion of personal capabilities through data.”
According to Inrupt CEO John Bruce, the company aims to leverage resources, processes, and relevant skills to make the Solid platform accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired from IBM, several staff developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all of their business models undergo radical changes in a short period of time.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
In a Saturday publication on Medium Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to “provide commercial energy and ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the basis of the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the Consortium of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debates on net neutrality.
Even at the launch of Inrupt Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the next era of network development,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: celebration of the dedication of the Church to the Order of the Cross of Victoria in the years of the First World War
The only representative of the Church of England, who received the Order of the Victoria Cross for participation in hostilities during the First World War, is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Col. Bernard vann was awarded the prize for his participation in the attack on Belangliz and Le<0xC3><0xB3>kur on 29 September 1918.
However, he died of a sniper bullet four days later and never learned that he had received the highest military award from Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rashden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, called it "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann transferred his battalion through the Saint-Catherine Canal "through a very dense fog and under the dense fire of field guns and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the edge of the fire and with "desperate courage" led the troops forward, before which one broke into the field gun and destroyed three guns of the enemy unit.
Colonel Vanna was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather had done what he himself would never have been able to repeat and deserved respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann put on a wreath after the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he “feels very proud of taking part in this parade” and added that “the respect of a real hero demonstrates the respect that so many people show him.”
MMA fans did not sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 tournament, but instead showed them the "Peppa Pig"
Imagine that you don’t sleep all night just to watch the event-packed Bellator 206 tournament, and you are denied the opportunity to watch the main event.
The posters of the tournament, which took place in San Jose, included 13 fights, including six episodes of the main program, which aired live at night in the UK on 5 channels.
At 6 a.m., just before Gerard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to get into a fight, television viewers in the UK died of a surprise when a Peppa pig appeared on the screen instead of a broadcast of the fight.
Some viewers were not impressed by this, as they did not sleep until the morning, waiting for a fight.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that switching to a children’s cartoon seemed to him “somehow unsuccessful a joke”.
“According to the government’s decision, the content that was broadcast at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to release the children’s broadcast,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and public relations at Bellator, a spokesman for the BBC.
"Peppa's pig, yes."
Bellator President Scott Cocker has promised to work on a schedule of broadcasts to cover and viewers in the UK in the future.
"I think if we talk about re-broadcasting, we'll be able to set it up," Cooker said.
“It’s still there on Sunday, 6 a.m., and we can’t do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we are working on it.
Trust me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages that we responded to, and the text of those messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical malfunction, and we tried to remove it.
However, it turned out that it was a non-compliance with government regulations.
I can promise you that this will not happen again.
We will reduce the tournament to five fights instead of six, as usual. We tried to redirect the signal to the fans, but so far we have postponed these attempts.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "worse" than others because of his sexual orientation
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to achieve success.
A 24-year-old athlete said he did not understand that “not everyone is like him” until he went to high school.
Taking part in the broadcast of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, conducted by Lauren Laverne, he noted that he spoke out about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that due to his fatherhood became less concerned with winning the Olympic Games.
The leader, who has been running this program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for several months.
Coming as a parody on Laverne’s first program, Daley said he felt “worse” than others in his childhood because “the society didn’t notice when someone liked boys and girls.”
He said: “Until then, the sense of inferiority and difference was precisely what gave me the momentum and strength to achieve success.”
According to him, he wanted to prove that something is "worthy" so as not to disappoint all those who finally learned about his orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist became a well-known champion for LGBT rights and used the appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke openly about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion admitted that the feeling for a man, American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was a real surprise to him.
Daley went on to win the Oscars, 20 years older than him, last year, but, according to him, the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" (at the first Olympic Games he performed at the age of 14 and after three years his father died of cancer), it is difficult to find someone of his age, who would also experience such landings and falls.
In June, the couple had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and since then, according to Daley, his "acceptance" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, I would only think about what gold should get,” he said.
“You know, there are things much more important than the Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not reconcile with the idea of an end, and before his death asked if they had purchased tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be sitting in the front row because you won’t be around anymore,’” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“I knew it was what I had been dreaming about all my life: to stare at my compatriots at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better than that,” Daley said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song – Proud (Gordy) performed by Geiser Small – which resonated with him while preparing for the Olympic Games and still provokes ants.
The Desert Island Discs program will be released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m. in English summer time.
On Saturday, from the tournament for the "Rider Cup" they took out Michaelson, who was not in shape
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game in the tournament for the Ryder Cup, but he must re-form so that this event does not become unlucky for him.
Michaelson, who for the record 12th time takes part in the tournament, which takes place once every two years, pulled out of the game Captain Jim Furick for the time of squabbles and forsams.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, the five-time winner encouraged the team all day and trained in the side, hoping to master the emotions.
Because Michaelson wasn’t famous for hitting even while at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old wasn’t quite suitable for a challenging field for Le Golf National golf, where Rafe usually punishes for stray hits.
And if the field is not the same as the obstacle, in the ninth match on Sunday, Michaelson will have to meet with the champion of the Open Championship and the master of the exact hit of Francesco Molinari, who in pair with newcomer Tommy Flitwood has won all his matches.
If the Americans, who are behind three points after 12 single games, start well, the match of Michaelson can be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his athlete, and, probably, besides that, he had nothing to add.
“He understood his role to the end today, pushed me on my back, embraced me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
"He has no doubt in his powers.
Michaelson is a member of the Hall of Fame, which has done so much for teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play in two games.
I predicted more matches, but that’s how it turned out, and that’s why we decided to do so.
He wants to be there, on the field, just like anyone else.”
If Michaelson goes out on the field on Saturday, he will beat the record of Nick Faldo, who played the largest number of matches in the Ryder Cup tournament.
On this he may end his career in the tournament "Rider Cup", which never corresponded to his individual achievement.
On account of Michaelson's 18 wins, 20 defeats and 7 knockout results, however, Furik said his presence could play a decisive role for the team.
"He's funny, he's delicious, he likes to joke with others, he's a guy who's great to have on the team," Furik said.
"I think the younger players have had a lot of fun coming to him, as well as this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He’s more than just a player.”
European team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that the big breakout doesn’t solve anything
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a noticeable kickoff before the singles matches of the last day of the tournament for the "Rider Cup" still does not guarantee victory.
The Dutchman made his debut in 1997 in a game at the Walderrams field, where the team led by Sej Ballesteros outscored the Americans by five points, but won in a match with a minor setback with a result of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You remind yourself that we had a big kick in the game at the Valderrama field; a big kick in Brooklyn, where we lost, and on the Valderrama field, where we won violently,” Bjorn said after watching the winning games of Class 2018 with a score of 5:3 p.m.
So history teaches me and every player on the team that nothing has been decided yet.
Tomorrow we have to play with the maximum.
Go out on the field and do whatever it takes.
The game will be completed only after the result appears on the table.
We have a goal – to win this trophy, and that’s what we want.
As I said before, I will focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are well aware of who will oppose us – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players on the difficult field, Bjorn added: "I will never run forward.
Tomorrow, everything can be different.
Tomorrow we are going to have individual matches, and that’s something else.
It’s great to play on the field with your partner when things are going well, but just when you’re standing there alone, and you can check out what you’re worth as a golfer.
Here’s how to set up players to perform tomorrow: at the limit of opportunities.
You leave your partner without support and now he has to show you what he can do.”
Unlike Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furick expects his partners to play better on an individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Until Fury's fate on the last day came back to different sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but suffered defeats when a team from Europe created "Miracle in the Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenneshaw, captain of the 1999 team, organized the players before the final day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start successfully as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone’s side, players in the middle of the distance will experience special pressure.
We appropriately placed the players as part of the team, so as if we were going to, like, do something incredible tomorrow.”
Thomas was instructed to try to lead the counterattack in the top-flight match against Rory Machill. Next in the first half of the European team were Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flintwood and Ian Potter.
“I chose these partners and in this way, because I want to distribute the effort evenly throughout the game,” Bjorn commented on his choice of players for individual matches.
The introduction of a new German warship has again been postponed.
The most modern frigate of the German Navy was supposed to enter into force as early as 2014 instead of the obsolete warships of the Cold War era. However, according to local media, this will not happen at least until the next year due to malfunctioning systems and a sudden disappearance.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, received from the spokesman of the military department, the launch of the ship "Reinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the series of the most modern frigates of the class "Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg", is postponed until the first half of 2019.
This ship had little to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery damaged the implementation of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful weapon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some observability reduction technologies, in particular, radio, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is the longer period of technical support. It is expected that new frigates will not be able to return to the base port for about two years.
However, journalists Die Zeit caution that due to the constant delays, the super-modern warships, which were supposed to strengthen Germany's military power at sea, will also become obsolete at the time of commissioning.
The long-suffering frigate F125 hit the headlines of the Torik newspaper, when German naval forces officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first case of the return of a military ship to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned significant "defects of software and equipment", through which the warship became unfit for military operations.
The shortcomings of the software are of particular importance, as the crew of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ship consists of approximately 120 sailors – this is only half the number of soldiers who served on the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship has a significant excess weight, which worsens its operating characteristics and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
The Rhineland-Palatinate frigate is believed to be twice as heavy (7000 tons) for ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to incorrect equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of preparing the crew.
The expected <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion has turned into a colossal <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
Problems with the acquisition of new frigates have gained special weight in light of recent warnings about the decline of German naval forces.
Earlier this year, Guns-Peter Bartels, the Bundestag’s chief military officer, said the country’s Navy had “a small number of ships left to carry out combat missions.”
The official said that the situation quickly deteriorated over a certain period of time, as the old ships were withdrawn from service and the new ones did not arrive.
He expressed deep regret that none of the "Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg" class frigates were able to replenish the naval fleet.
The national trust will be observed in the secret life of the sayings
A new study, which is being conducted on land use in the Scottish Highlands, aims to establish how the geese use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data obtained will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to carry out measures to preserve them in the future.
In the gardens of Inverness in Western Russia, scientists of the National Trust of Scotland will observe such species as netpyr dwarf and netpyr pygmy, as well as the ear a regular and watery night.
Special registrars will be placed in strategic locations on the territory of land holdings to observe the behavior of the spokesmen during the season.
Employees and volunteers of the National Trust of Scotland will also conduct mobile research using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to establish the frequency and belonging of the screams of the speakers.
It is then planned to develop a detailed map of the animal's residence and prepare a report to link the behavior of the animals with the environment of their residence.
Rob Dewar, an advisor on nature conservation in Scotland's National Trust, hopes that the results of the study will help determine which areas of residence are most important to sayrs and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of care measures for the environment of existence (e.g., formation of logs) and to determine the optimal methods of forest conservation for sedges and other related species.
During the last century, the population of the Saxons decreased significantly in Scotland and in the territory of the United Kingdom.
They are threatened by the active construction and development of the territories, which deprives them of their nesting places.
Among other negative factors are wind installations and lighting, sticky paper for flies, chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
The words are not really blind.
However, by hunting at night, the ears more effectively help them to catch prey than the eyes.
They use a complex method of ecolocation to detect insects and obstacles in the trajectory of the flight.
In the National Trust of Scotland, which houses more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special importance and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, are very seriously faced with the problems of the speakers.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, check nesting sites, and sometimes even rescue operations.
Efforts of the organization even created the first and only reserve for the Saxons in Scotland. It is located on the territory of the Triv estate in the region of Damfris-and-Gallois. In it found refuge of eight of the ten Saxons living in Sch<0xC3><0xB6>tland.
Managing Director David Thompson says it’s the perfect place for them.
“In the territory of the estate of Three excellent conditions for sayers”, – he assures.
“There are old buildings, a lot of big trees and other favorable living conditions.
However, we still need to know a lot about the sayings. Thanks to the research that we do here and elsewhere, we will be able to learn more about what they need to thrive.”
He insists that it is very important to check the territory for the presence of sayings before carrying out any technical work, because due to the unintentional destruction of one nesting place for the removal of a young man can kill up to 400 females with infants, which, in turn, will cause
Poultry and their nests are protected by law. Animals are forbidden to kill, torture or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Centre for the Conservation of Drought, called on the public to join the organization's efforts.
She said: "We still need to know a lot about our sayings. We have not yet revealed the characteristic features of populations of many species."
Ronaldo Rejects Accusations of Rape, and His Lawyers Prepare a Claim Against German Edition
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape a "slippery" and said people were "trying to draw attention to themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published information about the suspects.
American Catherine Mayorga has accused the forward of Portugal's national team and the Juventus football club of rape, which took place in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
As reported by Der Spiegel magazine on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid her $375,000 for silence.
A few hours after the charges were dropped, 33-year-old Ronaldo turned to 142 million of his fans on Instagram, calling the corresponding messages “admiral.”
"No, no, no, no!
Today’s accusations are a slap,” the five-time holder of the “Golden Ball” made such a statement on the camera.
“They want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to get used to me, but such situations are part of my job.
“I’m a happy person and I’m fine,” he added, smiling.
According to the Reuters news agency, Ronald’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for published charges, which they called an “unacceptable report of suspicion in the sphere of private life.”
Advocate Christian Sherz said the player will be required to pay compensation for “moral damage in the amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is likely to be one of the strongest cases of personal rights violations in recent years.”
It is claimed that the incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Casino hotel room in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after the meeting in the nightclub of Ronald and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally. Such evidence was passed to the county court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the described incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees in front of her and said that he was a "99 percent good guy" whom he raised "one percent".
As stated in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but with general consent.
Mayorga also claims that she turned to the police, and then to the hospital, where the injuries she received were photographed. However, she later agreed to extrajudicial settlement because she was "feared of revenge" and warned of "public humiliation".
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel her previous deal as she continues to suffer from an incident that, she said, took place.
At the time of the occurrence of this incident, Ronaldo was preparing to move to Real Madrid FC from Manchester United FC. This summer he became a player of the Italian football grand, the Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will ‘extremely regret’ the loss of automakers
The UK will be "fairly disappointed" if it loses the status of a world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit. This is warned by Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was approved by a statement by Toyota UK representatives, who told BBC journalists that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the company will be forced to suspend the production and operation of its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Minister Clarke.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The plant in Bernaston, which manufactures Toyota cars from Auris and Avensis, has produced about 150,000 cars, 90% of which have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU in an emergency at the end of March, production at our plant will be halted,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Bernaston.
Other automakers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about Britain’s exit from the EU without a deal on international trade.
BMW, for example, said that the production plant of the Mini model in Oxford will be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of automakers are related to the fact that a no-deal Brexit can pose risks to supply chains.
Toyota’s production line operates in the mode of prompt delivery of parts and materials according to the needs – the parts come every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there may be disruptions in the supply of parts at the border, which will lead to delays and shortages of materials.
As noted in the company, Toyota stock can place parts no more than for one day. So the production will have to stop.
Greg Clarke noted that in the plan of organizing relations with the EU, prepared by Theresa May (Chequers Plan), "separately provided for schemes to avoid problems at the border".
"We need an agreement. We need to make an optimal agreement, which, in my opinion, will allow not only to achieve success at the present moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during the program Today on BBC Radio 4.
“Given the testimony of Toyota’s representatives, as well as other automakers, we still need to preserve the highly efficient supply chains that have been formed.”
Toyota has not been able to announce how long production will be halted, but in the long run it is expected that the increase in costs will lead to a decrease in the factory's competitiveness and, as a result, will reduce jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris, head of the Unite Professional Union Organ Committee at the Bernaston plant, who has worked here for 24 years, said other participants are extremely concerned: “From experience, I can say that shortened jobs are not being restored.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for the formation of our future relations with the EU.”
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, notes the White House
As White House officials said on Sunday, Donald Trump’s responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “scheduled for another week” as discussions continue on the candidacy of Brett Kavanaugh in court.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice on the part of the president.
For several months in Washington, D.C., the possibility of a deputy attorney general’s release is discussed, which will jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken out about the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of early termination of the president's powers under the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House in the background of reports that an official is going to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at the U.N. headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't" release Rosenstein, but then postponed the meeting to avoid a time-lapse with the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting, which was supposed to give testimony to Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News Sunday television show.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date of the meeting is not scheduled. Maybe it will take place this week. I expect it to be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see. I’m constantly monitoring that the press has the latest information.”
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders did not hold briefings for the media in the White House since September 10.
The lead Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that frequent briefings were not related to the "public game" by television reporters, although she added: "I will not deny that they are playing in the public."
She then assumed that Trump himself would communicate with the press more.
“The president answers the question more often than any president to him,” she said, adding without referring to the source: “Statistics speak for themselves.”
Sanders noted that the briefings will still be held, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the U.S. president a question, it’s better than talking to me.”
We often try to communicate with the press. This should be especially noticeable during the last few weeks. The opportunity to speak with the President of the United States is no worse than a press conference.”
Trump regularly answers questions during events outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences with the participation of high-ranking guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held in person.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why it is so, acting in front of journalists in a frenzy and sometimes wildly.
Scotland’s Secretary of State for Health has addressed EU workers in a letter in connection with fears over Brexit, a statement said.
The Secretary of State for Health said in a letter to citizens of other EU countries working at Scotland’s National Health Service to express their gratitude for their work and ask to continue it after Brexit.
Gin Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already taken on an obligation to cover the cost of applications for the status of permanent resident for EU citizens who work in autonomous public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman said: "During the summer there were negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of exit. Already this autumn we should wait for the appropriate decisions.
But the UK government is stepping up its preparations for a possible exit without a deal.
I know this period can be very worrying for you.
That is why I would like to emphasize once again how I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and beyond share valuable experience and skills, strengthening and improving the work of healthcare services for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home. We very much want you to stay.”
Christion Eberkromby has undergone a short-term operation after a head injury
The midfielder of the team "Tennessee State Tigers" Christion Ebercrombie transferred a temporary operation after receiving a head injury in a Sunday match against "Vanderbilt Commodores", which his team lost with a score of 31:27.
The head coach of the Tennessee State Tigers team told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
“He went to the sideline where he was hurt,” Reed said.
On the sideline, the trainers and medical staff gave Eberkrombi oxygen before taking it on their noses for further examination.
A Tennessee State Tigers team official told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel (Nashville, Tennessee) that Eberkrombi had been operated at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "so far there is no evidence of the type and severity of the injury". The Tennessee State Tigers team are trying to find out when the player was injured.
Eberkromby, a second-year student, spent his first season in the Tennessee State Tigers after moving from the Illinois team.
He made five interceptions of the ball on Sunday before leaving the game. Thus, during the season, he has 18 interceptions.
Foreign buyers will pay more state duty in case of acquisition of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay more customs duty in the event of the purchase of real estate in the UK. According to new plans, the additional funds will be spent on the help of the homeless
This event neutralizes all attempts by Corbyn to attract young voters
The higher state duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes to attract an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help the homeless.
As today announced by Theresa May, foreigners who buy real estate in the UK will pay more customs. Additional funds will be spent on the help of the homeless.
This step can be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters by promising to provide more affordable housing for high-paying workers.
The tariff increase will apply to natural and legal persons who do not pay taxes in the UK. Additional funds are directed by the government to help those who are forced to spend the night under the open sky.
The additional duty, which is accompanied by an increase in the two-year old age for the second home and real estate, intended for rent, can be three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance hopes to attract an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate, which is built in London, is owned by foreign citizens. This leads to an increase in prices and complicates the task of those who only dream of owning a home.
Many of the country’s rich areas, particularly in the capital, are empty, as a large number of foreign buyers live most of the time outside the country.
The new plan of action came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in state tariffs to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused the large construction companies of maintaining high prices for real estate through the accumulation of land without further its use. He called on Theresa May to abandon the quotas for affordable real estate to correct the "bad situation on the housing market".
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of important reforms in the field of real estate, including the control of rent and the impossibility of evicting without a heavy foundation.
It also proposes to expand the powers of local councils in the field of construction of new housing.
Theresa May said: “I promised Turk that I would dedicate my premiership to the restoration of the British dream – for every new generation, life should be better.
This needs to change in our imperfect housing market.
The UK will always remain open to those who want to live, work and build their own future here.
However, it is not fair to call the fact that individuals who do not reside in the UK, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same terms as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become unattainable. The problem of living under the open sky still remains very painful.”
Jack Ross: 'I want to be the head coach of Scotland's national team'
Sunderland head coach Jack Ross says he is “over the top of everything” to ever lead the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish has taken to rebuild the club from the north-east of the country, which now ranks third in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, returning last season to FC St. Mirren in the Premier League of Scotland.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to Scotland’s second team, but that’s what it ended up doing,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound radio program.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the Scottish national team play at the Hampden Park stadium, which has always attracted me.
The only hope for me remains to be successful as the head coach of the club.”
Ross' predecessors in the Sunderland F.C. included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Ellardays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former head coach of FC "Alloa Atletik" claims that he did not feel anxious about moving to the big club following such authoritative names, previously rejecting proposals from FC "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town".
"At the current stage, it will be considered that he has achieved success if the club returns to the Premier League.
Thanks to its structure and material and technical support, this club, without a doubt, corresponds to the level of the Premier League,” he said.
“It won’t be an easy task, but another result I’m unlikely to consider successful for myself.”
Ross only builds a coaching career for three years. Before that, he worked as a second coach at Dambarton FC, and also spent 15 months at the coaching staff of Garts FC.
He then helped "Alloa" recover after the F.C. reached the third division, and the following season from "St. Mirren" passed the way from the exit stage to winning the title of the first division.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career in the F.C. "Clied", "Hartlpool", "Folkerk", "St. Mirren" and "Hamilton Academical".
“I was on the road,” he recalls, speaking about the move to Alloa FC.
“I honestly believed that coaching was more appropriate for me than playing a game.
It sounds strange, because I was successful, I made a good profit on it and reached certain heights.
But playing is very difficult.
There are a lot of challenges that need to be overcome every week.
I still deal with them, experiencing stress and tension, but as the head coach I feel in my place.
I’ve always been interested in coaching. I’ve never felt so comfortable in my entire adult life, as I did after choosing this profession.”
You will be able to listen to the full interview during the Sportsound broadcast on Sunday, September 30, on the radio station Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 British summer time.
Study: 17:30 on Sunday – the perfect time to cook beer
The summer heat helped increase revenue for British pubs, which are experiencing not the best times, but increased pressure on the network of restaurants.
According to estimates, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7%, while restaurant profits decreased by 4.8%.
The author of the calculations Peter Martin of the organization CGA, who is engaged in consulting on business development, noted: "Thanks to the sunny weather and more lasting than expected, the participation of England in the World Championship, in July passed past that time.
The fall of June by 1.8% in July increased.
Pubs and bars, oriented to the supply of beverages, while have the best indicators - the increase of their profits is equivalent to the losses of restaurants.
The pubs that serve food also suffered from heat, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that visitors are only interested in drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars, sales of beverages per month increased by 6.6%, while sales of food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM’s licensing and hotel business department, said: “We’ve been seeing similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large-scale social or sporting events remain the main factors that affect sales in the domestic market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to lose profits. The annual fall in sales by 4.8% causes a special concern in the background of the need to reduce costs.
The long hot summer has not come at the best time for establishments that provide food. We will see if it is possible to give them such a necessary rest at a more moderate temperature, which we observed in August.”
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the release of new brands.
The industry sales volume indicator of Coffer Peach Tracker in the pubs, bars and restaurants sector of the UK is a reflection of the collected and analyzed performance indicators of 47 working groups, the total turnover of which exceeds 9 billion pounds.
Every fifth child has a hidden account from their parents on the social network.
According to the results of the study, one in five children, sometimes less than 11 years old, has a hidden account on social media from parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages on Instagram.
This news raised concerns about the possible placement of the content of sexual nature.
20% of students reported having a “basic account” that they show to their parents
One in five children, sometimes less than 11 years of age, create an account on social networks that hides from adults.
The study, which included 20,000 high school students, showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages on Instagram – a social network for photo-sharing.
This news has raised concerns about the possible placement of the content of sexual nature.
20% of students reported having a clean "basic" account that shows their parents, as well as one or more private ones.
The mother, who happened to be on the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw there a call to “rape me”.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 years have two social media profiles. Half of these children admitted that they have an additional account and record.
Mike Byukenen, head of HMC, said: “We are very concerned about the fact that many teenagers feel the desire to create an online space in which parents and teachers will not be able to find them.
Eileen Doyle to become ‘representative of the interests of athletes’ at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eileen Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as an independent director during the annual general council of board members.
Doyle is the most well-known athlete in Scotland. The head of the council, Jen Bitty, called this a great opportunity for those who lead the sports movement to take advantage of its wide experience gained internationally over the past decade.
“Elyde enjoys tremendous respect amongst the athletes of Scotland, the UK and the world. We are confident that by bringing her to the council, athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly,” Bitty said.
Doyle said: "I will be inspired to act as a representative of the interests of athletes. I hope that I can really benefit and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland."
An American, a four-time Olympic champion who won 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and now a sports observer for the BBC, lost the opportunity to walk through a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "That's why I had a stroke last month.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors claimed that only time will tell if I can recover and how much.
Thanks to my incredible efforts, I managed to recover completely. I learned to walk again and today I am doing dynamic exercises!
Thank you for your support!”
In the advertising of the milk-smoker, women compared with cows – the opinions of internet users were divided
The manufacturer of milk-smokers faced an ambiguous reaction of Internet users to advertising, in which young mothers are compared to actual cows.
In celebration of the release of a product called "the world's first silent milk-milk-smoker", technology company-manufacturer of consumer goods Elvie has released a humorous music video-style advertisement to demonstrate the freedom it provides to mothers of new generation.
Four real mothers dance in a blue cornice under a song that contains the words, “Yes, I feed myself, but I don’t have a tail” and “As you see for yourself, it’s not my skill, but my breasts.”
Next, the choir sings: "Smoke, suck, to feed the children. Suck, suck, so that the milk is not wasted".
However, the advertising video, posted on the company’s Facebook page, caused a turbulent discussion online.
The video got 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. However, the reaction of internet users turned out to be ambiguous. Many people noted that the advertising underestimated the "terrible organization" of milk production in the industry.
“It’s not a wise decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk. However, their children are taken from them a few days after birth,” wrote one of the users.
The Elvie Milk Inhaler can be easily hidden in the breast cavity for feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Here’s another comment: “It’s clear that it’s traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not attract them for advertising a milk-smoker for women who need to feed their babies?”
Someone else added: “This advertisement is very far from reality.”
Other users spoke out for the protection of the advertising video. One of the women of the video seemed "very funny".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd definitely buy something like that if I was still breastfeeding.
When I was milking, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I wasn’t looking for hidden content in it.
“It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Here’s another comment: “Comfortable advertising focused on moms who suck out milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertisement is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, women are shown milk-smokers, hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women, who use similar products, feel like cows.
However, the Elvie absorber works absolutely quietly, does not have wires or tubes and is easily hidden in the bra for feeding. Thanks to this, women can move freely, keep children and even go out.
Anna Ballarin, partner and executive creative director of the advertising agency Mother, commented on the situation: "The Elvie vacuum cleaner is such a revolutionary product that it required a bright and provocative presentation.
Having made a parallel between women who breastfeed milk and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the features of breastfeeding, in an exciting and interesting way demonstrating the incredible feeling of freedom that the new absorber will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie has been in the headlines.
As part of Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on stage with this product during a show of clothes by fashion designer Marty Yakubovsky.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly crossings of the border has remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies by the Trump administration have complicated the process of placing children in caregivers.
Traditionally, in most cases, caregivers themselves acted as undocumented immigrants. Now they are afraid to put their own opportunity to stay in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that these data would be passed on to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, the Bureau’s top immigration and customs officer, testified before Congress that the Bureau’s staff had arrested dozens of people who applied for care of underage people without escort.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a criminal past.
"About 80% of the people who are caregivers or members of their households are in the country illegally. Many of them are foreigners who committed the crime.
That’s why we continue to persecute these people,” Mr. Albens said.
According to the staff of the shelter, in order to consider children’s cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days after the arrest.
Many of them will be able to use the videoconference link, rather than go to court in person to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who do not have the right to receive asylum by the court decision will be quickly deported.
According to the shelter workers and official data from responsible officials over the past months, the longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will feel anxious or depressed. This can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Human rights defenders argue that these problems are exacerbated in larger institutions, such as Tornio, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological state of children.
They added that by moving children to the tent town and not giving enough time for them to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends, we risk reinforcing the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria has ordered “occupational forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw troops immediately
In addition, while speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been at war for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, so "the attitude towards them will be appropriate."
"They should go immediately and not put conditions," he said at the assembly.
Mualem stressed that “the war on terror is actually over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of people have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence", he said.
The U.S. has deployed about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mainly training and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In the devastated war, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
As for the refugees, Mualem assured that the country had created the right conditions for their return. He also blamed "some Western countries" for the fact that they "spread unwarranted fears" through which refugees do not dare to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to people’s return,” he said.
“We are watching efforts to politicize the very humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide Syria with assistance in restoring the country until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish agreement, it was possible to prevent the large-scale offensive of the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the deal has "clear terms", and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked militants of the al-Nusra Front, who "will be destroyed".
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will be made up of representatives of the government and the opposition, to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create conditions for holding elections.
Mualem laid out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying his work should be limited to "review of the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be re-elected
Under this logic, Trump could be re-elected in 2020, if, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, he will not be empowered early after the scandal and impeachment.
Without a doubt, it would be “the most dramatic end of the presidency of all time”!
At the moment, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on CNN and actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable channel was at the top of the ratings with 3.5 million viewers in the evening when new headlines were discussed.
“This is a fire that attracts people because it’s beyond our comprehension,” said Neil Ber, executive producer of drama “The Last Candidate” on ABC’s channel about a secretary of state who becomes president after a devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skovell, an experienced humorist writer and author of "Just Funny Moments: And Some Strict Truths About Entering the Hollywood Men's Club" offers another theory.
She recalled a trip in a Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"Because he'll make me laugh," he said. That's the story Mrs. Scowell told me.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, stories from Washington are able to determine the future of Row vs. Wade, the possibility of uniting immigrant families, and the state of the world economy.
Detachment is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it can not be said that you are only trying to remain informed citizens of the Washington Post, when you are watching for six hours for a group of experts discussing the use of Bob Woodward "well-known" sources for his book "Fear", the jacket of Paul Maa
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the same again.
"The feeling of reality-show is partly connected with the fact that every night you agree something new," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the TV show "Stars of the Lombard", about the rotation of the actor.
If you allow yourself to miss a single episode, you can be hopelessly behind.
When I was able to meet Mr. Flies at his home on the northern coast of the island of Kauai this week, there was a warm sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not break away from the TV – not when Brett Cavano stood before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung on his hair.
“I remember how we created all those crazy shows of our time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Flies told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but they seemed to be right.”

External Funding in the Hardest Intermediate Elections in Congress <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
It is not surprising that in the 17th district of the state of Pennsylvania, additional cash flows are directed, because through the revision of the boundaries of the electoral districts, two current congressmen fight for one chair.
In the struggle for this suburban district of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed, a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives Conor Lemb, enters, who won another district in an additional election last spring.
Lemb is opposed by another current congressman, Republican Kita Rothfs, who now represents the old 12th district of the state of Pennsylvania, whose boundaries largely coincide with the new 17th.
The maps were reworked after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old boundaries of the districts were targeted in favor of Republicans against the constitution.
Pre-election races in the new 17th district have caused stiff opposition between the financial divisions of the main parties, the Democratic Party of the United States Committee on Congressional Elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lemba's name became very famous in Pennsylvania after a win with a minimum margin in the 18th district during an additional election to Congress in March, which garnered widespread public attention.
This place belonged to Republicans for more than a decade. President Donald Trump won this district with an advantage of 20 points.
Political experts have given a slight advantage to the Democrats.
In the U.S. considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but reconsidered
Diplomats recalled the weak resistance on Washington’s part to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. Earlier, Trump also had a hotel in Panama, until the partners escaped from there staff hired by the Trump Organization.
Officials of the State Department have decided to revoke the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognition," Department Press Secretary Gezer Neuert said at the beginning of this month.
But the sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, in particular in the field of drug control, as well as in the framework of supporting social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which provided for the reduction of financial aid and the targeted restrictions on the issuance of visas, would be painful for this Central American country with its high level of unemployment and murder.
According to the results of internal councils, officials from the states of North and Central America postponed the conference at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity. A similar event took place last year, and it was assessed as a step forward in the effort of the United States.
But by mid-September, the high-ranking representatives of the administration made it clear that they want the conference to take place. In fact, on this consideration the issue of sanctions against El Salvador has stopped.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence now plans to speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign that the administration considers this event very important.
At the same time, three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, as there were no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr Bolton’s White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the internal discussions, which were reported by three U.S. officials, two of them diplomats, on condition of anonymity.
The information provided to them was confirmed by a third-party analyst, close to the administration, who also spoke on the terms of anonymity.
Studying the history
The next inconvenience may be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller about the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, a weighty confirmation of why it can be found in the public information available now.
As part of his investigation, Mueller is reportedly verifying the possible link between Trump’s campaign and the attack on our voting system by Russia.
If the influence in Congress goes to other hands, Trump will have to report to Congressmen, as well as to voters and, ultimately, one-party parties.
There are a lot of “ifs” in this case, and I don’t want to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, just like his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West began to resist him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and have lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The tide of history is defined by such turning points, and the impassable movement of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
Americans are now waiting for a few such milestones.
What will we do if Trump releases Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mr. Mueller’s share depends?
Rosenstein got into the limelight as soon as the news in this newspaper appeared that he secretly offered to record conversations with the president and shared his thoughts on Trump’s inadequacy of the position.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
“How do we react if the investigation into Brett Kavanaugh’s case, which the FBI recently launched, turns out to be insufficiently thorough or honest, or if Kavanaugh’s candidacy for office in the Supreme Court is upheld despite convincing allegations of misconduct and sexual misconduct?
And, first of all, will we vote in the medium term for those members of Congress who will be able to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe that we will not betray, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Saturday candles on the table with swastika.
Having such a legacy, can I not look to the future with optimism?”

Graham Dorrans of Rangers with optimism is waiting for a meeting with Vienna's "Rapid"
FC "Rangers" takes "Rapid" (Vienna) on Thursday. After an impressive nobody in Spain in a game with "Villarreal" at the beginning of this month the victory over the Austrians will provide the Scottish club with a good chance of getting out of the gypsies.
Due to injury to the knee midfielder Graham Dorrans was able to play for the first time in the season for his team only in a match with Villarreal, which ended with a score of 2:2. However, he believes that FC Rangers can use this result as a trap for more.
"For us it was a good result, because Villarreal is a strong team," the 31-year-old said.
“We came out to the game hoping to get a point and got one point.
Maybe at the end of the game we could go forward, but in general nothing, probably, can be considered a fair result.
In the first half the opponent was better, but after the break we corrected the situation in our favor.
There will be another important confrontation in the Europa League on Thursday.
I hope we will be able to get three points, but it will not be easy. Our future opponents showed a good result in their last game. However, we can count on the support of the fans. I am sure that we will be able to give a fight and get a positive result.
Last year, of course, was difficult, starting with my injuries and ending with changes in the club itself. But now the situation has normalized.
We have a great composition, and all the guys are satisfied. The training is going well.
I hope we can go further, leave behind last season and achieve success.”

Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to organize care for themselves, few spoke about it with members of their family.
About half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said they talked to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents talked about it with children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they are not in a hurry to start a conversation on this topic,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance division.
Here's what you need to start with.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care if you do not inform your wishes to your relatives in advance.
Consult with your counselor and family to determine where and how to get care, as this choice can become an important factor in determining the cost.
Engage a financial advisor: he can advise a way to cover the relevant expenses.
Sources of funding for long-term care include a traditional insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy, or self-supporting at the expense of your own funds (provided you have the money).
Carefully prepare legal documents: this will allow you to avoid the legal burden in advance.
Prepare the trust for your representative, who will monitor your medical care and monitor that the specialists will fulfill your wishes in the event that you are unable to do so personally.
In addition, we advise you to make a deposit at the disposal of cash.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and will pay the bills in the event of your incapacity.
Do not forget about minor details. Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs urgent medical care, so he is taken to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Pal on Friday, government officials say, but the number of victims may rise.
Due to the withdrawal of the means of communication, officials dealing with the issues of providing humanitarian assistance cannot receive any information from the regency of Dongal, a region north of Pal, which is located closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 points.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Pal.
Here are some basic facts about the island of Sulawesi, the city of Palu and the regency of Dongal.
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 according to data for 2017.
When the earthquake, which caused a tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that stretches for more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
According to 2017 data in the regency, the administrative region, located in the lower part of the province, lives about 299,200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sectors of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but mainly concentrated in Morovala, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian agency for the mitigation of the consequences of natural disasters over the past 100 years, Pal and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times.
In 1938, more than 200 people died as a result of a tsunami in Donggala and hundreds of houses were destroyed.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of the Dongal, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in an seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Acheg province, located in the north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean as a result.
2005: At the end of March at the beginning of April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, and caused a tsunami that struck the southern coast, resulting in the deaths of about 700 people.
2009: near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province, recorded an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters in height, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the regency of Pidijaya in Acheg province, causing destruction and panic, due to the fact that people have not yet managed to forget the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the rubble of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, resulting in the deaths of more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many houses, and thousands of tourists could not immediately leave the island.
Sarah Paylin's eldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Trec Pailin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Pailin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Police Department, 29-year-old Paylin from Vasily, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with obstructing the report of a case of violence and inciting arrests.
According to a police report, when a familiar woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he picked up the phone from her.
As reported by KTUU, Paylin is under house arrest in the Matanuska-Susitna Investigative Insulator with the right to pledge in the amount of $500.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself “guilty” when asked if he recognized his guilt, the network reported.
Paylin is charged with three Class A offenses, which include a one-year arrest and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with Class B offences, and this is punishable by a day of imprisonment and a $2000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Paylin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as the fact that he obstructed the report of a domestic violence case and carried a weapon in a state of alcoholic intoxication when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Paylin was criticized by veteran groups for justifying her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, an earthquake caused a tsunami: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-point magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Networks of communication and electricity supply have come to a standstill, and the number of victims may increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the center of the island of Sulawesi, located in the northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
The video, which is distributed on social networks, shows the moment when the poem hit.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Pal, when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Demand Rare Death Penalty for Suspect in New York Terrorist Attacks
In New York, federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty of Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in a New York terrorist attack that resulted in the death of eight people – a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, the 30-year-old Saypov, under the guidance of a rented Home Depot pickup truck, went on a bicycle path along the highway in West Side, Lower Manhattan, and began to hit cyclists and pedestrians who were on foot.
According to the report on the intention to reach a death sentence filed in the Southern District of New York to substantiate the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saypov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" injured serious body parts.
According to court documents, each of these points of indictment provides for the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Sworn Prosecutions brought charges against Saipo on 22 counts, in particular eight counts of murder for the purpose of a claim, which usually federal prosecutors bring charges in cases related to organized crime.
According to the prosecutors, who described Saip’s crime as “horrible, cruel and malicious”, this attack is the result of “serious planning and preconceived thinking.”
The victims that Saikoulla Habibulaevich Saipov had sustained injuries, injured or killed were Diego Enrique Angelina, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lora Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferroui, and Ernan Ferroui.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been ten years since New York’s Southern District last violated a criminal case punishable by the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers, and was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty for a federal case was brought to execution in New York in 1953. A married couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War for two years.
Both Rosenbergs were killed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saypov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not demonstrate any signs of conscience in the coming days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he did not regret the incident.
According to the indictment, Saypov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out an attack on the ISIL video he was watching on his phone.
Police say he has also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He did not find himself guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sayipov, said they were "very disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting the confession of guilt and to sentence eternal imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only reinforce the psychological trauma caused by these events to all the victims,” Paton said.
Saipov’s defense party had earlier also asked the prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
MP from the Conservative Party believes that NJJELA FARADJA should be appointed responsible for negotiations on Brexit
Today, during the protest action at the Conservative Party's congress, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army".
The former leader of the UK's Independence Party said that politicians should "feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics, as one of the MPs Theresa May proposed his candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
A Conservative Party MP, Peter Bowen, said on a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom “would have come out” if Mr. Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
Paying attention to the problems facing May, trying to reconcile their deeply divided ranks, drew even more attention to the fact that members of the Conservative Party, who are opposed to leaving, joined a special protest action in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is trying to implement a compromise plan Chequers, despite attacks by Brexit supporters, those who oppose the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will not thwart attempts to negotiate with Brussels, despite a negative reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what it offers and "chaos".
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihala, Mr. Bowen said he wanted to "give up the Chequers".
He offered Mr. Faraday to step out of the shadows and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge of it, we would be out already,” he said.
Parliament MP Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We have fought in world wars not to be subordinated.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bowen rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, public opinion had changed: “The idea that the British changed their mind and did not want to go out is absolutely not a reality.”
Conservative Party member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, told reporters: "I'm just saying, 'Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists, who are actually walking the streets and fighting for the votes of voters.
Please dismiss the Chequers and start listening.”
In a reference to Theresa May, she added: "The Prime Minister retains his position when he fulfills his promises."
Mr Farage said politicians should “feel pressure” if they are going to give up on the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people and our political elite,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say they can’t get away with it.”
In a message to the crowd, he added: “I want our political elite, which is planning to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel pressured.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit passed Birmingham, and then held a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
Several activists were waving banners “Conservatives Against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
The Labour Lord Adonis laughed at the conservatives because after the opening of the conference, security problems arose through their party program.
"These are people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies necessary for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he said.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is nothing good about Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to "seriously think" about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would “seriously think about running for president.”
The Boston Globe reports that a representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts told about her future at the Western Massachusetts General Assembly on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for a second term in November against Republican Party member Jeff Dill, who was co-head of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It is considered to be the main candidate who can fight Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she held her 36th meeting with voters in the format of the general assembly since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to take part in the presidential election.
Warren responded that “it’s time for women to go to Washington and set up a government, and for that there should be a woman at his head.”
Arrested suspect in the murder of basketball player "LSU Tigers" Sims in the shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested the suspect in the shooting of basketball player Wade Sims's LSU Tigers on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Diton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting with a request to help recognize the person on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot at the University of Southern campus on Friday morning.
"Vide Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result," Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade gave up on his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the investigation, it was found that Simpson was at the scene of the crime, had a gun with him, and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody in the East Baton County Police Department.
Sims, whose height was 6 feet and 6 inches and who played in the junior league, grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 stars last season and spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the field, scoring 5.6 points.
Russia Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton cut back on the fight for World Champion title after the team made the decision to give him a victory over Sebastian Fettle
Since Walter Bottas left behind Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes’ team decisions will play a significant role in the race.
Bottas started well from the pole position and almost bypassed Hamilton, who tried to hold his position on the first two laps and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Fettel went to pit-stop first and left Hamilton on the track at the tail of the race, which was all to be decided.
The driver of the Mercedes team drove another lap and came out behind the Fettella, but Hamilton broke into the leaders after a certain maneuver wheeled to the wheel, as a result of which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the interior space due to the risk that he would lose it.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back row of the net and stayed in seventh place until the end of the first round.
On the way he led most of the race, as he did not change the tyres to quickly come to the finish and move Kimi Raikkonen from fourth place.
As a result, he stopped at a pit stop on the 44th lap, but was unable to increase the pace to the last eight, making Raikkonen fourth.
"It's a difficult day because Valtteri was fully trained on all weekends and showed nobility when he gave me the opportunity to walk.
The team has done an exceptional job to take first and second place,” Hamilton said.
The body language was not impressed.
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dayan Fainstein for her firm position that she did not disclose the contents of the letter Christine Blaise Ford, which accuses the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in sexual violence.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not turn directly to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead expressed his opinion on events in the Senate that, he said, demonstrated human “longitude, stupidity.”
“The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that have happened in the last few days in the Senate, is anger, you see the evil people who are demonstrating stupidity, cruelty and falsehood,” he said.
“You look at the publication and the advertised information, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diane Fainstein, did you publish the information?
Remember her answer... Did you announce the contents of the documents? – “What?
Oh, no.
I didn’t advertise.”
Wait a minute.
We advertised?... No, we didn’t,” he added, copying the senator’s behavior.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing the allegations filed by Ford against Cavano, and in early September, its contents were announced, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusation, I didn’t disclose the information received from her,” Fainstein told The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn’t break my promises.”
However, her objection seems to have been disliked by the president, who commented during a Saturday rally: “I’ll tell you, the language of her body was not impressed at all.
Maybe she didn’t do that, but I haven’t seen anyone stay worse.”
Continuing to defend the candidate in the Supreme Court, which three women have been accused of sexual violence, the president has assumed that Democrats are using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are full of determination to return power in any necessary way.
You see the stupidity, the cruelty, they all have one thing to insult, who needs to be violated in order to gain power and control,” Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: "Dandy Stars" – "Belfast Giants", 5:3
Giants player Patrick Dwayneer dropped two wickets in a match against Dundee
"Dandy Stars" were rehabilitated for Friday's defeat in the elite league from "Belfast Giants", winning a match-response with a score of 5:3 on Saturday.
The Jayants were given an early advantage in two drawers thanks to the throws of Patrick Dueler and Francis Boville.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney leveled the bill in the home game, and then Dwayne brought the Giants back forward.
Dandi player Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bushar equalised the score, and two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen ensured their victory.
This is the third defeat of the Adam Kif team in the elite league season, which won a 2–1 victory over Dandi on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting of the season. The previous three matches were won by the Giants team.
Dwayne's first goal ended in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFall's transfer, and four minutes later, Boville, who received the goal from David Rezerford, doubled the score.
After a tense first period on the fourteenth minute (13:10) Sullivan returned the fieldmasters to the game, and on the sixteenth minute (15:16) Couni, receiving a check from Matt Marquardt, equalled the score.
The duo secured the Jayants' lead before the first break, leaving their second quarter at the end of the first period.
The masters of the field regrouped, and Bushar again equalised the score in the twenty-eighth minute (27:37), leaving the bar when his team was numerically superior.
Thanks to the efforts of Counie and Charles Corcorran Nilsen at the end of the second period, he led "Dandy" forward for the first time and secured the victory of his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Giants team, which has already lost four of the last five games, will play a away match against Milton Keynes.
The flight attendant died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid an earthquake.
Indonesia’s air traffic controller has been declared a hero after he helped fly a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing after a severe earthquake caused a tsunami on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong underground surges continue to shake this area, many people found themselves under the rubble in the city of Palu.
However, unlike his colleagues, who fled to save his life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the highly-excited dispatch tower at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in place to make sure that the flight 6321 of the Batik Air, which at the time was on the runway, safely rose into the air.
Then he jumped out of the dispatcher's tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesia’s air navigation service provider, Johannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian news agency ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which is to deliver it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Paula.
“We’re very sorry to hear about this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims could reach thousands, as the agency’s mitigation of the consequences of the country’s natural disasters says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims can increase, as many bodies are still under the rubble, and many of them cannot be reached," Sutopo agency spokesman Purvo Nugroho said.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, devastated the city of Palu, where mass funerals will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and food to the crew.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, the ambulance brings the body.
There is not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help people who have experienced this tragedy, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidho arrived in Pal on Sunday and addressed the country’s military personnel: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: as stated in Air Niugini, after the crash of a plane in the lagoon, one man disappeared unconscious
The airline, which carried out a flight that had been involved in disasters in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one person has disappeared, although it has previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew have been safely evacuated from the plane, which is a ton.
Air Niugini said it was unable to find one passenger on Saturday.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a man and to do so cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request to provide more detailed information about the passenger, for example, about his age and nationality.
Local crews helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew a runway and a runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low over the ground.
"It's very good," Janes said.
Janes said that he and others managed to get to the emergency exits on a thin plane while on the belt in the water.
He said that the stewardesses panicked and shouted, and that he had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors who worked close to modernizing the beaver also assisted in the rescue operation, bringing people to shore with the help of an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in aviation accidents related to PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
The analyst restored the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution violated the case against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in the field of operational development for several hours.
He told members of the jury how he used cell phone records to recreate the movement of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Rowlett, as reported by The Clarion Ledger, said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which contradicts his previous claim.
When the data showed that his cell phone was near Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the latter.
On Saturday, Sanford testified and stated that he was not in the city that day.
When the defendants asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night he was in the Sanford pickup truck, Sanford said he was "liest because my pickup truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, he deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers' phone.
“He stole her from his life,” Gail said.
The defense is expected to put forward its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects that the trial will be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
The trio of hip-hop performers want to challenge the negative view of the genre, filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed group from Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature – away from political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the springs and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently witnessed the revival of this direction in the United Kingdom thanks to groups such as Akala and Lowkey.

In New York, a babysitter filed a lawsuit against a couple for dismissal, receiving a "racist" message
In New York, the nanny filed a lawsuit against a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a misdirected message from her mother complaining that she was “another dark-skinned.”
The wife denies that they are racist by comparing the claim to the "competition".
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, having two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, who arrived on her first working day in 2016, was a dark-skinned woman.
“No, I’ll be one of a kind,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him Miss Morris twice.
As reported by the New York Post, realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt "discomfortable" and released Ms. Morris. She stated that their previous nanny, who was an African-American, did poorly her job and that she was waiting for a nap instead.
Mrs. Morris was paid for one day of work, and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is filing for a couple in court, hoping to get compensation for the exemption in the amount of the fee she would get for six months of working with a spouse, on which she was initially hired, though without a contract. She had to pay $350 a day.
“I want to show them that we don’t have to do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
In response to the accusation that they were racist, the wife said that Morris’s release was a wise decision, as they feared they would not be able to trust her after being insulted.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Post reported her husband Joel Plasco.
“But would you leave your children with the person you’ve been rude to, even if it wasn’t intentional?
Your baby?
NAVRAD".
Comparing the lawsuit to the "competition", Plasco said his wife gave birth to the child just two months ago and "has not yet announced".
“Would you revenge someone after that?
This is a bad thing,” added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
As stated in the new letter, the publishers of Padington feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear who is able to speak.
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born almost immediately after they agreed to print the book, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it’s funny because we know about the huge success that Padington’s story has had.”
Telling her that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before a little toy bear inspired him to write a children’s book, was optimistic that his work had been rejected, she shared how she had seen the book’s 60th anniversary from time to time.
As for Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
"He was a very humble man and didn't like to brag," she said.
"But Padington was so real to him, like his own child! After all, when children achieve something, we are proud of them, although it is not theirs, but our victories.
I think he looked at Paddington's success just like that.
Although Padington is the creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him.”
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye by phone.
After landing her daughter was taken to the 2nd hospital named after Louis Pasteur in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
“I phoned her regularly, saying that it was really bad, that she shouldn’t have done that,” Ms. Ednan-Laperuz said.
And then Nad called me and said that she would die within the next two minutes and I had to say good-bye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.”
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating, gradually stopped acting and left the body.
She died some time before everything was shut down.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was going on at this time.
I couldn’t complain, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
She really had to hold herself in her hands.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, who was burned by the loss of her daughter, was on a plane with other passengers, not paying attention to the harsh tests she had to endure.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I lowered my head and couldn’t hold back my tears.
This is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to deeply sympathize with Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her.”

Sharon Davis and Kelly Gamfries leave a postcard with phone numbers on the Wall Street Bridge that people can turn to for support, as well as messages that might inspire them.
Ms. Davis Tyler's son was 13, when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he put his hands on himself.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the same way I do every day,” she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lidne, said her son was a prospective chef with an attractive smile.
“Everyone knew him for a smile.
They always said that this smile made any room brighter. . .
But he quit his job before he died because he was "like in the dark".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, found his brother's body after he put his hands on him.
Miss Davis says, “I’m constantly afraid that it will have consequences.”
Ms. Davis created the postcards, “so that people know there are people they can turn to and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
“Don’t shut up, we need to talk.”
Ms. Gamfries, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband Mark, with whom she lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say that he felt depressed, that he had depression or something like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed.”
And on Christmas day, he finally got distracted by the spirit. When the children opened their gifts, he didn’t look them in the eyes or otherwise.”
She said his death had been a huge injury to them, but they had to live through it: "It was a devastating thing to do.

But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on his hair: FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could get what we asked for – limited in time and nature of the investigation – we might have reached a certain agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would “disband” in the face of a sudden loss.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their unhappiness has to do with time.
The interim elections will be held in just five weeks, on November 6th. If, as expected, Republicans will have problems, it will seriously complicate their attempts to conduct through the elections of their own person in the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush telephoned the senators with a request to support Mr. Cavano, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush and thanks to whom he met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
The Senate, which now has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavano will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy for the post of Judge of the Verkhovna Rada.
During Kim's rule, the number of North Korean refugees "decreased"
After Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined, South Korea’s lawmaker said.
Again, Pyon Seugh, referring to the data of the Ministry of the Association of the Republic of South Korea, said that last year the number of refugees amounted to 1,127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Pak said that the key factors were the strengthening of border control between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers who transport illegals are now demanding more money for it.
In Pyongyang, they abstained from public comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans are finally offering South Korea’s citizenship. . . .
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of it flows through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It is easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views migrants as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the issue of denuclearization, the talks about which came to a standstill.
This happened after a June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-Ho, blamed the United States for the lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no unilateral disarmament,” said Ri Yong-Ho in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavano "hysterical" and says he is unfit to work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the post of Supreme Court judge Brett Cavano "hysterical" and said that he is by temperament not suitable for working in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I’ve always thought that if a woman ever acted that way, she would be called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi commented on Kavanaugh’s reaction to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh behaved very emotionally, sometimes almost screaming and distraught, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly denounced Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him an “absurd and coordinated destruction of reputation” organized by liberals who were outraged by the fact that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pelosi, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court, as this showed his preconceived attitude to the Democrats.
"I think that with these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will run for president," she said.
Pelosi was stunned when she was asked if she would try to declare Kavanaugh impeachment if his guilt was confirmed, and whether Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say this: if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only fit to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the "Available Medical Services" law or the "Roy v. Wade" case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings on the question of approval in the post of Kavanaugh, the party ignored the question of whether he would annul some decisions of the Supreme Court.
"Now is not the time when the judge will become a hysterical, biased person and we will say how wonderful it is," Pelosi said.
Women need to have this weapon.
These are just words that have been stored up for months and years of rage, and she could not pronounce them without tears.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
She continued: "One woman, who once worked as an executive director and was very helpful to me, said that she was also crying when she got angry, but she had her own method. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the interlocutor: "You can think so, you can think so,
I am evil.”
After that, she just continued.
I thought it was incredible.”
Tears are considered an acceptable way out of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my clearest memories of the first job in the office, where mostly men worked, was a situation when I once cried out of unspoken anger, and the older woman – an unwelcome manager, whom I always walked a little bit scared, – to the sidewalk.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They will think that you are sad and will be glad that they have come to you.”
Patricia Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, the then Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was caught on an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business, after which he got out of the race, deeply disappointed Mrs. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der decided that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates have already taken part in the race, and another candidate is the last one they needed.”
Someone called the situation “White Snow and the Seven Dwarfs”.
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was late in fundraising, so she made a promise not to take part in the race if she didn’t collect $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not hurt the support of the men of $1,000, gave her only $250.
"Do they think they'll give me a discount?" she wondered.
When she spoke with a speech and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, her emotions covered her – gratitude to the people who supported her, disappointment with the system, which made it very difficult to collect money and forced to focus not so much on the voters, as on the members of the party.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der recalls.
You would think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they would write on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the U.S.-China trade war were desperate, and, while still far from its completion, the long-term split between the countries could benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first pre-emptive shots earlier this year, taxing China’s main export goods, including solar batteries, steel and aluminum.
The biggest situation this week has been exacerbated by new tariffs on goods totaling $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which actually taxed half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has paid back the same coin each time, recently imposing a duty of five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to take similar U.S. measures, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to miss the opportunity to keep that promise in the near future.
To force Washington to step down means agreeing to the demands, but for President Xi Jinping of China, the public worship of the United States is too shameful.
However, according to experts, if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, pressure in a trade war with the U.S. could give China a long-term advantage, reducing the interrelationship between the two economies.
“A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic downturn in any of the countries. And this is actually a greater threat than the observers have previously acknowledged,” said Security analyst Ebigail New Grace, who
The Minister of Foreign Affairs said that Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees
In Syria, they say they are ready for the voluntary return of refugees and are seeking help in restoring a country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking before the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said the conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the real situation has become more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can return to normal life.
At present, all conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and limited the means of existence.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian government would be pleased to receive assistance in the restoration of a devastated country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that support the slaughter.
Europe consolidates victory at the “Rider Cup” in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 when it won the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has already lost in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won the "Rider Cup" tournament here since 1993.
Europe returned to the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, which they needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who had tried his best most of the tournament, broke his first long-range strike on the 16th moon par-3 into the water and surrendered to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds and became one of the four players who have ever played 5–0–0 since the start of the tournament in the modern format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spitt suffered a 5:4 defeat from a player with the lowest rating in the European team Turbyern Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the first step in the world rankings, surrendered with a score of 2:1 to John Pooler from England, who may have participated in the last Ryder Cup tournament.
Spanish Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a veteran of the Ryder Cup, who has already participated in the tournament eight times, became the European, who has won the most tournaments of all time, bringing 25.5 points for his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad to have the cup back.
It’s a merit of the team, and I’m glad that I was able to help,” Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a said, without holding back the emotions after the victory in Europe.
He relays the relay to his compatriot John Remus, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a solo game with a score of 2:1.
"I'm incredibly proud of the victory over Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," Ram, 23, said in a statement.
In France, Woods lost all four games and now has a career record for the tournament "Rider Cup" 13–21–3.
Strange statistics for one of the most outstanding players of all time, who won 14 Major tournaments, surrendering only to Jack Niclaus.
The U.S. national team during all weekends tried to reach the ferry zone, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaw, who showed high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furick said of his team after an uncomfortable performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we dominated Europe for a short time.
We fought.
I'm taking off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We are regrouping, I will work with the Association of Professional Players in the U.S. Golf and the Ryder Cup Tournament Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
You can’t praise them.
We've lost."
Up-to-date information on red tide: reduction of concentration in the districts of Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota
The Florida Commission’s latest report on fish and wildlife shows a general decline in the level of flowering of red microorganisms in some parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife, the conditions of abundant flowering, which are reported in certain areas of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, are evidence of a decrease in concentration.
Flowering by microorganisms of red color extends about 130 miles of coastline from the north of Pinellas to the southern counties of Li.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Gillsborough County, but they are less than last week.
A red tide was also observed in the Pasco district.
last week reported on the average concentration in the district of Pinellas and its coastal zone, the concentration from low to high in the coastal area of the district of Gillsboro, high concentration in the district of Manat, high concentration in the district of Sarasota, and
In the counties of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Lee and Collier continue to report irritation of the respiratory organs.
Such reports were not recorded in the northwest of Florida last week.
