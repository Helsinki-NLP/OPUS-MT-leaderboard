The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The perceived weakening of both existing parties in the grand coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to the early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously waning, has suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the deputy mayor of K<0xC3><0xA4>rnten J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, is preparing for the triumphant return to national politics.
According to provisional results, the strongest party in the country remains the Socio-Democratic Party (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8% of the votes, but it loses 5.5% compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, it went for <0xC3><0x96>VP, which lost with 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian history of the post-war period and above all the literally catastrophic result of the popular ones, which led to early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP abandoned the coalition, the populars had a considerable advantage in their preferences over SP<0xC3><0x96>.
But the voters have obviously punished them for bringing down the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party president, Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe that it could take place as early as Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the party leadership.
This evolution should perhaps facilitate the path towards the increasingly likely exit from the electoral outcome, i.e. towards the renewal of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition .
As regards the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties, the Liberals (FP<0xC3><0x96>) gained 18% in advance and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11% in votes, but the Social-Democrats at the same time revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the people in the collective government (the 2005 election)
Haider clearly plays on this evolution, which has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to enter Parliament, but it has fallen slightly, falling between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth.
No other party has clearly exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it could not solve the problem with Czech scientists who have been accused of illegally collecting beetles in India, it would happen, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it didn't work out, then you'd have a certain cooling," he said after the meeting that took place under Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that executive power can hardly interfere in legal matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government can negotiate with the local one in Dardjeeling which falls under his jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era to be sentenced to three years in prison to appeal to a ‘higher court’.
Then you can ask for bail and wait for the sentence to be released.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"He recommends recourse to the Supreme Court then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get involved is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support", the Indian Minister said.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relationships that have been handed down for many years with India.
The Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, in front of his partner he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake to detain and charge these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister has avoided answering the question whether he has obtained from the Indian side the promise to take care of the matter.
“I got relatively many promises,” he only noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It is close to the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and the adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But it is not interested in the continent but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 UN Division workers on ocean and maritime rights issues.
His boss, the Czech lawyer director of the Division, V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, is following his exposure and occasionally adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other mineral materials, but also unknown living organisms so far that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest base of the land
The coastal states began to lend interest to the underwater territory.
According to the UN convention, they take advantage of the laws on which they made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental platform that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
According to the Convention, it has an exclusive right to all the resources of the continental shelf.
In a few words by continental shelf one means that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often more than 200 nautical miles,” explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits to the Commission for the definition of the size of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a very broad technical and scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
“One of our tasks is to provide the commission with legal and technical and professional assistance.
The Commission has so far dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominees have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
Australia’s recent success, which has greatly expanded its maritime holdings, has recorded a global echo.
But New Zealand has also earned us - the seabed area, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, is about 1.6 square kilometers so about six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit, which will benefit him in the future from the seabed, as promised will be priceless.
Other states will also gradually submit their requests.
They can do so for ten years since the Montego Bay Convention has been ratified.
Where the continental shelf ends begins the area of the bottom of the ocean that the convention has declared a common heritage of humanity.”
No state has an exclusive position here.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
“But the Marine Foundation is not Klondike,” he says exaggerating Director Mikulka, “with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime contractually established.”
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
If you divide it with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
It acquired the status of a so-called pioneer investor in 1991 according to the convention, as well as investors from a few other states.
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean extended between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the ‘investor’ and slightly larger than the ‘ex-Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is crushed, it is an almost underwater replica of Tatry.
"It is possible to extract 75 000 square kilometers on the total surface.
The area is a rich field of polymetallic agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings with him a find to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a bit of fantasy, a legendary schem, as in the legend of the Golem awakening.
German special units were present at the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany for the release of hostages – the experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but they did not intervene.
More and more detailed information is coming to us about the circumstances of the release of the 11 European hostages seized.
On the rescue operation, as the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior mentions, German special units participated in it.
In addition to the military specialists were the GSG9 units, the Federal Aviation Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution.
As the ministry spokesman said Monday evening, German units did not intervene because the kidnappers, given the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages fleeing.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the spot.
“We didn’t get here fortunately,” said a spokesman for the interior ministry.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers in southern Egypt on 19 September: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian escorts.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end remained secret as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the liberators arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the hostages released are under the protection of the German embassy.
The details of the release have not been explained.
In Berlin there was no information, for when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild" the 5 vacationers and special units are expected to fly with an Airbus of military aviation and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects the bailout package.
The first chamber of Congress has just failed the $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell to the ground.
With 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and top politicians from both parties, there had not been a majority for the program, with which the chaos of financial markets would have to be aggregated.
In a dramatic move, supporters have desperately tried to persuade critics of the $700 billion hefty package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, urged MPs to agree, although the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have gratitude to avoid something, which has not yet arrived..
While the suffrage was ongoing, the Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent or by 600 points.
The reason for investors’ concerns was that the state bailout could have failed.
It resumes before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of failure, collapse again.
Experts are now expecting other serious turbulences in the international financial markets.
To ensure that the programme enters into force, it must have the well-being of both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.
Promoters record increased numbers of bookings
It seems that it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to one study, the turnover on travel bookings for the next few months compared to the previous year has increased significantly – for the winter season even more than 30%.
Despite weak views of conjuncture the desire to travel from the Germans according to an investigation remains solid.
On bookings for the winter season travel agencies recorded a 31% increase in turnover compared to the same period of the previous year , as the German Association for Tourism DRV reported in Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the market research institute GfK there are increased booking rates even for the autumn months.
So the excess of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would amount to about 11%, the DRV reported.
Supposed for these results are the figures of the GfK, which monthly analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and develops statistical projections for the entire market.
In addition, travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 would be included.
Due to the weak dollar quote, the requested in particular would be travel to the United States, the DRV reported.
Here the increase in bookings would amount to about a third.
They would also be particularly sought-after travel destinations for Germans in Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as inland locations in Germany.
Above all, all-inclusive trips have a high rate, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be “better calculated for customers than for an individually organized holiday”.
Consumers could save money through, among others, discounts for bookings made in advance or offers with everything included, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so much so that compared to the previous year an excess of the turnover would again have been recorded - although according to a further study the number of Germans who undertook a trip, compared to the previous year has dropped.
My first time at the Oktoberfest
Ballermann's hits, beer from a liter and vip in Dirndln graffiti.
A debut at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don’t have much in common.
She is blonde, TV moderator and wears a custom made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing unites us: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, photographers are already throwing themselves at us and taking photos to fill the memory of the cameras – very luxurious, and this on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The two-money Dirndl seems to achieve its goal.
As a tourist of the Wiesn and actually resident north of the white sausage equator, the sense of well-being in the costume/dress to this day still remains within limits.
And when you get to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather pants; nobody looks disgusted or embarrassed – everything is perfectly normal.
Only the nursery of my Dirndl collects strange looks at the stand of the chocolate bananas.
A Monk tells me that I would have tied the nursery in the wrong way: "To the left you are free, to the center you are virgin, to the right you are engaged, behind the widow."
I suddenly set my neck from the back to the left.
It’s okay,” he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober felt hats, on which they cape "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch the naked back against an uninvited one.
The boy with showy inclinations is named Bob, comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a dash of "oooooo".
This tells me, after he got rid of his beer mouth from a liter drunk before.
Right next to one of these hydrants, which everyone thinks is a pattumira.
Bob is one of these famous "Wildbiesler".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about 8 p.m., health workers walk on the square of the party, who have to take care of the poor bees
The nurses appear every time in the blank – always 4 at a time drag a tent-covered bar in the tent.
This works as with most visitors to Wiesn: it goes empty, it returns full.
Those who lie under the telone in this blood-alcoholic bar, you can't see.
"Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn", screams one of the sanitaries and disappears into the coffin.
Victim of an incident identified by police
A 63-year-old woman who died in hospital after being invested by a vehicle while walking to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon incident on Sheffield Road in the city.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died shortly afterwards.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on charges of reckless driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey tried to enter the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, is one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what tourist guides tell you.
The building stands between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world as some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The entire building is slightly decaying.
But once inside the office ticket from the ceiling at a time, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the most westward passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retarder of the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of this railway that ran in Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperial ambitions sank during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
British and dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was bad news for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 an ammunition train exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then he has slowly gone into disarray, largely surpassed by history.
But today, this railway outlet for Anatolia and all points to the east, serve – at least symbolically – to highlight Turkey’s ever-larger diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the icy borders of the Cold War, has passed.
There is now a new commitment policy.
Significantly, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded the sleeping wagon for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning – about ten and a half hours later – after a bumpy run along the tracks that produced the ancient world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital – proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to turn its back on its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern structure of stone and steel - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by shopping malls built vehicles and power pastry shops, where managers in full of business - both men and women - meet to make matinee contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I'm sure he also had a Blackberry.
"The purpose of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbours.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he says.
Turkey has been cut off from its homeland.
Today he must look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of one or the other.
They must be both.
"But certainly at some point," I ask, "will Turkey be forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he says, "does not want to face that choice."
Then he points out a point that almost all those with whom I have spoken have acted in memory: the links of the Middle East not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are of benefit to Europe and the United States as much as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole of Europe can metaphorically travel those rail lines east through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at the Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had watched this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would be to find that Europe’s Middle Eastern ambitions can now be largely in Turkey’s hands.
And while I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that those days Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
Then at least there seemed to be no doubt as to which continent it was supposed to advance claims about this fascinating country.
Vite memorate: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As music director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologist, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under-21/ under 21 years old, but by the time Proteus sang its final in 1979, many of us were more than twenty - we simply refused to give up the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-changing) represented the good will of the choir and the ability to face all that music had to do, both madrigal and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He had said, "The composer knows what he wants.
There's everything there, in the music.
So sing it!”
His technique in the use of the dachshund was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial or flourishing.
Whatever the musical standard, it made it more and more elevated.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If you were to appoint a conductor, it would be Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I have covered more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with one of them – and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated the conductors of the orchestra who, in his words, were simply "climbing around the world one or two well-known battlehorses".
He's gonna miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary by William Woodruff (25 September) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a degree in science, one in letters and a PhD".
This follows from Woodruff's note in Beyond Nab End, but it is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the U.S. as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he permanently left Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida", because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have attracted my attention for the simplicity and strength they transmit, while treating the protagonists with particular respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feeling.
Resino manages to capture magical moments.”
Second assault on Honda supersold
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model was already equipped with great livability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
Added to everything is a refined mechanics, which increases driving comfort and allows you to save fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a line very similar to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger sizes and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after entering the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda renewed this model in less time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe the Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Almost a million units of Jazz have been sold in Japan since its launch.
The second market was that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow to increase sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 estimates are around 100,000 cars, assuming a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of Jazz since 2002, corresponding to 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, those in charge of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz over the course of a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the drop in sales in Spain to a good extent.
In fact, the company’s managers plan to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 fewer than in 2007, with a decrease of 16%.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to succeed, Honda is confident in the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format – 4.37 meters in length – which the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight’s sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be split between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after the company’s launch in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters plus), its width is 1.69 meters (two centimeters plus) and the stake is 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the living room also expands.
This advantage comes on the one hand from the introduction of a new platform, and on the other from the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the trunk – equipped with a double background – rises to 399 liters, that is, 19 liters more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measurements of the 1.4 engine version, and that the luggage capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements, such as rear LEDs or the ability to mount the panoramic glass - concern an improvement in accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the back positions, in fact, open with an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of commercialization, this small model will be offered in models with petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows you to lower consumption, produce less carbon dioxide emissions, optimize the mechanics and at the same time keep the engine torque high in all its phases.
The 1.2-litre model allows you to use a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 rpm.
The drive – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horses – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous powertrain, which in the first-generation model used 83 horses, there are now 100 available.
The Jazz 1.4 to 100 horsepower achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "ape car" to avoid collisions
As part of the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, and especially by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by taking the flight of bees, for example, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers at the Advanced Technical Center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and the Development of Brand Management, the BR23C is an expansion of the four-area safety shield produced by Nissan.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the vehicles of the manufacturer.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the eyes composed of bees, able to see in all directions with an angle greater than 300 degrees, and that allow the insect to fly without interruption in his personal space.
To recreate this visual functionality, engineers have developed what they called a Laser Range Finder (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism detects obstacles in front of the BR23C for a radius within two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately prevents the collision.
"The moment it detects an obstacle, the small robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning on the right-angle or larger wheels to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If it wasn’t, the robot wouldn’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate upwards or downwards, nor even diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and in the direction in which it can rotate its wheels and not exploiting infinite directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid collisions.
“This device only needs to process the information every few seconds, and to act starting from this data.
It does not require the storage of information or the intuitive logic of previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruptions and with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even mega.”
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standard in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to the destination avoiding the obstacles in the path.
Trema before asking for a loan
We must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, as well as having a lot of capital to intervene, is certainly not without ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis and to prevent Americans from engaging in money laundering in banks with questionable insolvency, they have created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of bad credit"... or problems.
The hefty aspect of this accommodation and, in particular, of its receptionist serves to induce you to think not one, but two or even three times before asking for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Of course, the information the game provides is useful, but it is not detailed.
It’s more of a page for teenagers than a site for the general public.
What happens if you complete the game?
Well, compare a songo room inside the hotel.
It’s always something, because to buy a better house doesn’t even talk...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a 21 percent stake in the Company, following a sharp decline in its shares in the Stock Exchange.
A week after the draft of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that the MUFG would buy 9.9 percent of Morgan Stanley’s stock at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum of $3 billion.
The fixed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a conversion price of $31.25, ensuring a return of 10%.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be made on the basis of an average price of $29 per share, which is a percentage lower than its current rate of 28%.
By 5 p.m., the Morgan Stanley title was down 6.79% to $23.07.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to a bank holding company,” said John Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to differentiate its actions by making them, however, pass under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with the MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than previously assumed.
The terms defined on Monday also show that in recent days the deal has been changed: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese colossus for a sum of $8.5 billion.
A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of the MUFG, explained: “We thought our share of participation would be exclusively composed of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, the MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price below their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis.”
The agreement provides that the MUFG will be able to convert in a year half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares if, during a given period, the latter were exchanged more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or at about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought by the MUFG would allow them to seize investment opportunities, strengthen their budget and increase their liquidity.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to provide clarifications on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After the investment of the MUFG, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a Tier One solvency coefficient of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said she had “clearly” eased her budget since the end of August.
The last few weeks have put the group to the test, which has seen it halve the value of its own actions while the cost of risk insurance has suffered a slump.
The cost was high on Monday, but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week the Goldman Sachs, the only other "survived" among Wall Street's major investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the Merrill Lynch detection, announced it had raised $15 billion, partly from the Berkshire Hathaway group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
The founding of the republic on socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter to give voice to the draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since, according to official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, based on a vote of 80%.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% white cards.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it should get half of the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polls and an estimate by a non-governmental organization announced a crushing victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed on the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed gloriously," he said, congratulating the Ecuadorians in the Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The poll, which was conducted calmly according to the Organization of American States (OAS) election observation mission, was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the president.
This draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially on the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently on their currency.
Conceived by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants greater power to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, to have the opportunity to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced its intention to take advantage of this amendment and to re-propose its candidacy for a new mandate in February 2009.
The constitution also states the free health and education services, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who were kidnapped ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions held prisoners in the desert for ten days were reported Monday afternoon, healthy and safe, in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released in Chad by an Egyptian command.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at Almaza military base, near Cairo International Airport, around 15 and 30, aboard a special aircraft.
On board a helicopter, they were transferred immediately, without being able to give any interview to the press, to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to the kidnappers," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the runway.
Buried on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been shrouded in secrecy by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the organizing agency for the safari.
An Egyptian security official said that 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, had launched the attack during the night, just before dawn.
"There have been shootings, half of the hijackers have been killed, while the others have escaped," the official said, who asked to remain anonymous.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the “lampo” unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed from Belgrade the importance of the role of secret agents and Italian special forces.
We must admit that if we achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our secret services, special forces," he said, without adding further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese patrol army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board which the hijackers were on board and to have killed six, including the Chadian leader of the hijackers, and to have captured two.
According to the army, the hijackers would be linked to an organization of Darfur rebels, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a statement immediately denied by the latter.
Letters- The Silent Majority of Culture
On the front page a debate on the financing of the culture on which the current election campaign focuses.
All the better.
But a part of our cultural life always remains in the shadows.
Who will speak out to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that make hunger?
What politician would dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don’t have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government pays three and a half million euros for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
To our American neighbors, it is the Constitution to affirm that the protection of heritage is part of national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by every political authority and by every government department, and all this by common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of Historic Societies of Quebec, there are at least 40,000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 societies for the protection of historical, genealogical, archives and heritage assets, preserve, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
It is they who, often, defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-making bodies attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis through partial nationalisation, which first ended in difficulty in Europe for the crisis of the American credit market: the three countries will provide <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interests also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands on the weekend agreed at the highest level, also involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debated for more than a year is that of the Fortis bank, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can be a precedent.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank’s share in the country.
The bank will almost certainly sell some of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the Fortis’ actions had started with a vertical collapse, serious signals of the institute’s crisis had then surfaced in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too big to allow them to go bankrupt.
The bank’s shares fell nearly 12% on Friday, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two-thirds.
Considering the current stock prices, the total capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank’s executives, this value is not real.
The company’s summit attributed the collapse of Fortis shares to the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the $700 billion US plan.
On Monday, the title slowed down again.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has presented themselves with a worthy offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors should not be afraid to lose money.
The panic did not spread among the customers of the bank, the subsidiaries were not assailed.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent subsidiaries and has also purchased leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken
In America, life and health insurers, based on people’s medical purchase data, often refuse to enter into an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription drug data in any case depends on the consent of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it’s like entrusting the chicken to the fox,” writes the Washington Post, citing Richard Dick, author of the program to follow the prescriptions of the drugs.
Insurance companies shall subordinate the insurance fee and the forward figure in case of claims to the health status of the prospective customer and if they consider the risk too high they do not stipulate the insurance.
Some time ago the client had to undergo a medical visit and the contract was concluded only after the end of the examination.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure 10 years ago: based on the customer identification code you can easily have information from the pharmacies on which medicines he bought in the last year and a half and from this program evince what diseases he suffers and in what health conditions he is in.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers this means that the level of fat in your blood is virtually unreasonably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
There are various versions of the program on the market, some also determine the risk multiplier, so the insurer does not remain much apart from the paper work, even if there are small difficulties.
Among the counters there are that some drugs are usable for multiple purposes, e.g. some compounds are usable against migraine or heat stroke, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the insurance - commercial point of view, is worth as a risk increase factor, the first two are not.
For the request and processing of data, separate companies have been formed and these, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask for the patient’s approval.
Now the authorities are forcing them to do so, even if they have not so far imposed fines for negligence.
Some companies have recently also processed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to the consumption data of medicines in order to provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data and in parallel control of usage will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on privacy but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of the Congress there is a bill that gives the authorities the power to control companies specialized in data services.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: for this reason he has developed a program that links the forwarding data with the consent expressed by the data subject.
Another issue is that the person concerned cannot so much deny approval because otherwise the insurers do not enter into the contract.
So then in the end the chickens are entrusted to the clemency of the fox.
Global Martian Menu
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are partners that trade above all with each other, even the agenda of the ninth meeting at the summit has been dominated by this theme, in addition to all other global problems.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will deal primarily with cooperation on atomic energy.
The European Union recognises that India is becoming a major democratic power to which more voice should be given in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
So he did not insist on this issue at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the rotating president of the Union, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they found the agreement to double in 5 years, i.e. increase up to 100 billion euros, trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods rose from 25 to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious target.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil aviation agreements, so even air traffic can take off in the future.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the deal.
The goal is to balance out because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU partners.
The summit has paid attention to global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and called for the convening of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Trade Round, although both sides played a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed that it will remain in the energy and climate agenda, meaning it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agrees on this, as well as on the fact that a global agreement should be reached at the climate conference scheduled for next year and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will travel to the French capital where he prepares to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that to build Indian nuclear reactors, French companies will receive a commission worth 20 billion euros.
According to information from our press agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
In Frankfurt over three hundred Italian publishers
A strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expected to host more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as a guest of honor.
It will be the Under-Secretary to the Ministry for Cultural Property and Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government in the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be present institutionally with a Punto Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
The meeting with the press will follow at Room Struktur in Buchmesse’s 5.0 pavilion: this will be the occasion to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of the books of foreign authors gradually decreases on the total of Italian production, and in particular on that of adults and boys.
Steve Fossett's plane found the billionaire missing a year ago
The wreckage of Steve Fossett's plane was found, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying in the Nevada desert.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-metre-high plateau in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, there were no human remains.
“The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it’s the one Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared,” he said at a news conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was sentenced to death in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) reported that a team of investigators was dispatched a few hours after the sighting of the wreck, which then identified the device: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed from September 3, 2007, when Fossett flew from Necropolis to Yest.
Yesterday, in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal effects had been found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's research had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world tour on an aerobatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had toured the world on a plane and without a ladder.
Among his many records, he also flew at 15,445 meters high, above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv out of the scheme with an original design and well defined by decided lines, wide surfaces and net angles.
This is, in short, Glk the latest born among the off-road “compacts” of the starhouse with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a glimpse of what’s new in this industry.
Precisely because of its content outside of traditional canons, it will be unexpected and unconventional also the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from October 17th.
So the advertising battage that will accompany the debut of the new car will start a new mode of communication also through a futuristic 3D poster campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi-affections, divided into three different phases, which will dominate the very central Milan shopping street, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic view and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car is coming out of the manifesto.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then reassemble into a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this ad is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it be able to stimulate the interest of future buyers with this formula? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls that all of Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Blue National for years and that so far, in truth, had never created excessive problems.
He had never clashed with his opponents.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added group bullets (a few units, actually) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolour flags where the cities of origin of the militants appear: Saturday night they were removed for not being identified.
They are inspired by English typhus.
In Bulgaria they found a fan shop of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made 144 tickets for the match available to Italian fans: all face-to-face, therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminale had in fact controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia there was no one with an ongoing Daspo, no one who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
Four blue fans, who had previous stage crimes, had in fact been denied the ticket and prevented from travelling.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then will take measures: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for at least five years to the fans who have been arrested or to those who have been identified in the riots.
An international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only the Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Well, luckily.
But now there is the fear-emulation: that to those little more than one hundred and fifty, others add.
“We must immediately put out this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way,” the Viminale said.
So, "good eyes open especially in view of the match of the National on Wednesday in Lecce".
In Puglia, in fact, there is a small core of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory will meet, on Tuesday the Casms which can also count on a section of the Aise, i.e. the secret services, which deals with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duke choirs and the stretched arm during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the thought (expressed in a really unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, since a few weeks director of the Observatory of the Viminale (he took the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been from Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the group Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to deny the Duke but certainly the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
"I do not make the sociologist - adds Observatory No. 1 - the crimes must be attributed to the country in which the incident takes place.
Until now this group had remained in line, now we will see well what happened and we will value for the future.
But let’s also talk about Mameli’s anthem whistles: even those aren’t criminal, but if you allow me, I’m not education.”
