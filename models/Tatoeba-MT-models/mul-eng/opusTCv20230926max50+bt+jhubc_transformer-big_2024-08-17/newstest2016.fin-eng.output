A 9-year-old boy found on the run in Tampere
Police have been searching for a 9-year-old boy on Tuesday night in Tampere.
A missing statement from West Tampere with his friend about the boy who left the scene has spread on social media.
According to the police station, the boy has been contacted and is not at risk for life and health.
The boy's father told Ilta-Sanom in the middle of the night that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start the follow-up investigation.
The boy was found near the house, the father said.
Ronaldo is back as a hero - a hippie painter in Messi
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league on the weekend and continued his career in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo over the Champions League’s drawing moon turned out to be at least a moment in the latter’s favor.
Real Madrid’s Ronaldo moved to the top of the all-time goal scorer rankings on his own when he shot a visitor to the network of Shahtar Donetsk in two penalty shootouts and one game situation.
Ronaldo raised his score to 80, with 77 hits before Tuesday at the Barcelona Messe, which was on a par with him.
Real won the game 4-0.
Juventus have been competing in Serie A since the start of the season, but in the Champions League D-League it started with a 2-1 win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was won by Alvaro Morata of Juventus for 10 minutes.
City's attack was dulled by the absence of a knee-jerk Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in the weekend’s election game, only came to the field in the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second team United also suffered a hard time in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 loss.
ManU's 20-year-old defender Luke Shaw's guest fight could only last an hour.
PSV's dangerous-looking slider-free Hector Moreno hit the target towards the attacking ManU pack so badly that Shaw was likely to have broken the seal.
Shaw was lying on the lawn of Eindhoven’s home stadium ten minutes before medical staff left to take him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the visitors to the 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU’s joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno balanced before the break with extra time.
PSV’s winning goal was scored by Luciano Narsingh in the second half.
In the Champions League, the A-League started in Paris Saint-Germain.
The Manchester United shirt was replaced by an Argentine Angel Di Maria.
Di Maria broke through from the right and pushed the ball past the back corner of Malm<0xC3><0xB6> goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG is among the most successful of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malm<0xC3><0xB6>, a member of the league's small teams, is not the best possible benchmark.
PSG star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic met for the first time in his professional career with Malm<0xC3><0xB6> FF.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team Moscow TsSKA lost the B-League in a match in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
Opposition party demanded immediate separation - the president gave the wrong speech
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe delivered the same speech he had delivered a month ago.
Zimbabwe’s President Robert Mugabe has once again delivered the same speech in the country’s parliament that he delivered at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether 91-year-old Mugabe was in full swing.
The main opposition party, the MDC, has demanded that Mugabe resign because he is too old to rule.
Mugabe's aides rushed to say that the confusion had taken place only in Mugabe's committee and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe’s speech dealt with China’s impact on the country’s economy in the past and now.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented next week an additional summit of EU leaders due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President-in-Office of the European Council at the Summits, assessed the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, heads of state should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively for the future of Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum-seekers are, according to Merkel, at the ministerial table.
Teacher admits he shot his girlfriend during an emergency call
The sound of just a little bit of colorful university teacher Shannon Lamb telling the police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" is alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact information of the deceased's relatives can be found on this phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss's body and a message on the hate page: "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel this beloved Amy and she's the only woman who's ever loved me," the letter said.
Nothing suggested that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the University of Minnesota's Delta State University in Cleveland, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to a school campus where police believe he shot and killed a history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this working room.
Lynn Buford, Delta State University’s police chief, told the university officials he heard the shooting at 10.18 a.m.
He said that Lamb had called an emergency call some time after that.
By the end of the day, the death toll had risen by one more time: Lamb committed suicide while police surrounded the fire.
Authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb’s motivational day after the students and staff had to hide behind locked doors due to the school shooting.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information that students and staff described Lambia as a gifted teacher, but that there may have been problems.
The students said they had been waiting for him for hours.
The police in the town of Prentiss, Gautier, say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lambi's writing in a book in which he thanked the "mighty people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, with a total of 17 staff members, and many of the students took part in both men’s courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers encouraged Lambia, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something had been wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, told Lambi that he had a lot of stress at the end of 2014-15.
Lamb had previously requested a sick leave from Delta State University saying that he had some sort of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s hiring principles meant that even though Lamb had worked hard for his doctoral degree, it did not give him an automatic career development and the position of assistant professor.
University principal William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt to know him, but that "there was clearly something in Lamb's mind".
Lamb is no longer able to answer these questions.
After Lamb had fled the campus, the police got to his tracks when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' home in the suburban suburb of Mississippi Greenville, Washington County death row investigator Methel Johnson said.
The Lamb's car was still running in the yard.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb felt the people living there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education. The university has 3500 students and it is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb completed his Ph.D. in Educational Science in the spring.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
His friends were in high school, and Lamb was a fun, older guy who tried for many years to teach Hairston how to play the guitar.
He was quite a charm at the time.
All of the girls were melted wax when she was there, said Hairston, 40, who lives in Jackson’s suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
In an emergency call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a riverbank tent in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen said they broke up 15 years ago, but stayed friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Steen described to his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen said he had never met Lambia, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both in the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together in some theaters.
O'Steen said that his daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for a number of different online businesses.
The bartender and occasional entertainer Mike Shaffer, who is located near Gautier, tells us that he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the last night of September 5 when Lamb had finished his guitar and harmonica show to a rare audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were playing and throwing dice at each other.
So they were both pretty smart.
The deceased teacher Schmidt led the first-year student seminar program and was specialized in Indian and colonial history, said the school’s English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three young children.
He studied at Kansas Emporia State University and was the chairman of his fraternity and student administration.
On Tuesday evening, a candle ceremony was held at the Delta State campus, attended by some 900 people, including faculty and other staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the fair, during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The lesson continues on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time to recover.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Pettus of Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans participated in the report.
The case has been corrected to the fact that police now say that Lamb has called an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that even if Lamb referred to his wife Prentiss during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it doesn’t hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says that current regular and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in businesses and distribution centers across the country, with 45,000 employees in the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although there are months of vacation, the Christmas season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help with the occupation of stores, as well as in the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is having a ‘meeting’ with Princess Diana
On the first night of the film Back to the Future, Michael J. Fox had a huge moment professionally.
It was also important for personal reasons.
“We sat in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana’s place was next to me,” he said in the upcoming documentary Back in Time trailer.
The movie starts and I think I’m just a short distance from the making and hand stretching of a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about the film Back to the Future, in which Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd were interviewed, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
Back in the future, he got his first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “To me, it’s definitely the greatest time travel movie of all time.”
Back in Time is available as a subscription video, DVD, and in some theaters in October.
UN chief says Syria's situation will not be resolved by arms
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s answer to Russia’s increasing military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict “does not resolve militarily,” and the additional weapons only aggravate violence and the suffering of millions of people.
Once again, the UN leader called on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite and support the non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a Wednesday press conference that he intends to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - during the week of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the dispersal of the Council, the people of Syria and the regional powers "has made it impossible to resolve the situation."
Ban called on the five permanent Member States to demonstrate the Syrian crisis in the face of the solidarity and consensus they demonstrated in the Iran nuclear deal.
8 Support Polls That Prove Donald Trump Is Serious
Some have tried to label him as a windbreaker.
Some people just think he's a joke.
Part of it is waiting to collapse.
While some Republicans have tried to pull Donald Trump out of the top of the polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
Of the last 11 national polls in the ten, Donald Trump has been in charge of the two-digit number, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for the real estate king’s naming opportunities.
The election season is only in its early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
Commentators note that at this point in 2011 Rick Perry was losing his leadership position to rising Herman Cain, both of whom did not win back any state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in the general election.
However, outside groups, such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth, have noted Trump’s sincerity and began to use his funds to overthrow him.
The following recent results of the support survey suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's popularity figures have made a full translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University’s endorsement polls showed that only two out of ten Republicans had a positive attitude toward the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 percent.
Six out of ten Republicans are currently in favor of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they are behaving negatively.
These figures are also true in the first Presbyterian States.
In a support poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they were positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “excited” or “satisfied” if Trump was a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they would be "shocked" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson achieves the same levels of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of “interested” vs. 40 percent of Trump).
The next most exciting thing?
Marco Rubio only 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "shocked" if Jeb Bush were to become a candidate.
Trump’s fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his powerful speeches and insults, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll on Monday, 52 percent of Republicans at the national level believe that the real estate king has a rightful place for the president.
According to a Quinnipiac poll last week, the number in Iowa’s first party meeting is the same: 52% of Republicans think Trump has a character that suits the leader.
However, according to the ABC/Post poll, 44 percent believe that his character is not suitable for running as president, and nearly six-tenths believe that his character is not part of the White House.
Republicans are getting used to the idea.
When Republicans think like commentators, they think that Trump is a real option.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, four-tenths considered Trump to be the most likely alternative when asked who is most likely to be nominated as a Republican candidate.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Disclosure of information: Republican voters have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball in their use.
During the last election, four out of ten Republicans in the U.S. considered Rick Perry to be a candidate, and only 28 percent supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters consider the Trump campaign to be credible.
Even if Republicans stood in favor of another candidate, Trump would still win nearly everyone.
Some commentators have noted that the fragmented field is likely to have contributed to Trump’s leadership, as the anti-Trump support has been shared among numerous other candidates.
However, a survey conducted at Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical two-way race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He's at a crossroads with Ted Cruz.
Trump's only winning candidate?
If they were set against each other, Ben Carson would win by a big 18-point margin.
The vast majority of Donald Trump’s supporters have said they have made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday showed that just over half of Trump-supported voters have decided who their vote is going to be.
The situation can change naturally, and no one can say for sure that it would never change his mind.
46% said they could potentially change the candidate.
In any case, Trump’s biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made the decision are twice as likely to be on Trump’s side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump about immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called Mexican immigrants “ridiculous” in his campaigning speech, immigration has been at the center of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump’s powerpoint is driving Latino voters away from the Republican party and harming rebranding companies.
According to a new ABC/Post poll published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is in the middle of things, so is Donald Trump.
Disappointment to the government has reached a new high.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, due largely to their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said on Monday in the ABC/Post poll that they would rather choose a person outside of politics than someone with experience in government.
They are also angry at the federal government.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll from Iowa showed that three-quarters of Iowa’s Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are “unsatisfied” and 21 percent are “really angry.”
Jeremy Corbyn's First Visit to the Prime Minister's Questionnaire
Corbyn's first appointment at the polling station has been eagerly awaited since his election
Jeremy Corbyn, the new Labour Party leader, meets David Cameron for the first time in a prime minister’s interview.
Corbyn will rise to question his first six questions a little after half a day, and it is likely that both the media and the Labour Party MPs will be watching his performance closely.
Corbyn has called for this week’s show “less theater and more facts.”
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities for his colleagues to be cared for.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test for Corbyn’s leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the Trade Union Confederation on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the leader of the Labour Party to stand quietly during the national anthem on Tuesday in the memorial service, which was held on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain air war, has raised criticism of the Conservative Party’s MPs and appeared in several front-page stories.
Corbyn's decision not to sing national anthem has attracted attention
Corbyn's representative said he "standing respectfully quietly" and that he acknowledged "the courage of the Royal Air Force in the Great Britain Air War."
Owen Smith, a member of Corbyn’s shadow government, told BBC Two Newsnight that he had urged the Labour leader to sing a national anthem despite the fact that he believed the royal palace should be discontinued.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to participate in Corbyn's internal affairs, drawing on differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs, with less than a sixth of the parliamentary party initially supporting him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that the line differences regarding the party's position in the European Union and the government's aid ceiling have "refused" even within the Labour Party after Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn said at a meeting of the Central Association of Trade Unions that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the entire roof.
Hours later, Secretary of Labor and Pensions of the Shadow Government, Smith, said the party was "very clear" that they were only opposed to the government's plans to cut the ceiling from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,0000.
Corbyn will become the fifth leader of the Labour Party that David Cameron has faced in the last decade, when he was the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new kind of approach to politics and now says that he has "thoroughened" ideas into questions for the Prime Minister, and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
Islington North MP Corbyn has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's questioning is too contradictory and that he intends to refrain from both nudity and restraint, instead of focusing on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and inequality.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government's secretary of finance, Angela Eagle, is acting in his place during interrogations when Corbyn is not involved - for example, when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also proposed that other colleagues should also sometimes be allowed to use speeches, and he has said that he approached the President of the House, John Bercowia, from the teams on the matter.
When Cameron took office in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from a political theater that is often combined with Prime Minister’s interrogations, but he later admitted his failure.
Since the start of television in 1990, the Prime Minister's hour of questioning has been an important gauge in assessing the discretion of the leader, his management of the lower house, and his position with other MPs, although critics have criticised the fact that there have been complaints about it and that
Pictured in Joburg: Homeless young people are trained as photographers
Johannesburg is a difficult place to be without a home.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and earn a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the young people who graduated from the first project.

The value of the pound rises as Britain’s wage growth accelerates
The pound’s value jumped up after numbers appeared to rise in UK wage growth, and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose as an offer target with SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK salaries, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same time last year.
The growth rate was the fastest since 2009, and it was considered to bring with it estimates of the rise in rates.
The point rose by more than one percent to $1,5505, and by 0.84 percent to $1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49 per cent to read 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinct market share and rose by 20 percent after competitor AB InBev approached it with an offer.
The agreement would combine two of the world’s largest breweries and other brands, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry’s share rose by 0.9 percent after a competing luxury product group from Richmont received encouraging news.
Richemont's latest sales figures were expected to be better, and they also showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had begun to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose 5 percent after the mine said it had raised $2.5 billion by trading shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
Mondi’s shares in the packaging and paper group were the index’s biggest losers by 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation from the company to “sell”.
JD Sports rose 3.1 per cent after the sports betting company announced its six-month pre-tax earnings: an 83 per cent increase to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
According to the head of JD Sports, higher wages can damage the expansion
Peter Cowgill, head of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for employees is raised in the UK, it could mean that “the purchasing power of potential consumers is increasing.”
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs could be attributed to the company’s expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash launches grassroots campaign against penetration of Aldi sector
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's attack in South and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before Aldi’s $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing for the opening of two distribution centers and the opening of its first store in early next year in South and Western Australia, with up to 120 stores coming. At the same time, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with the local food distributors, the media channels and the construction of the IGA
IGA’s dealers and buyers have jumped in, and brands such as ice cream maker Simmo’s from Dunsborough offer delicious IGA stores, and shop owners sell discounted tickets to Australian football matches to their customers.
Metcashin is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29 as it organises the annual Investors’ Strategy Day for Food, Alcohol and Iron.
There is a lot at stake, as South and Western Australia make up almost 30 per cent of Metcash’s IGA trade area, with higher profit margins than Metcash’s Eastern IGA network.
South and West Australian purchases are known to be angular, with IGA retailers having a much higher market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30 percent in the south and 24 percent in the west compared to the Eastern states.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley, however, believe that Aldi will capture about 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening up the first stores. The turnover is obtained from all operators, but mainly from independent retailers.
In its report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales annually and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 businesses in the south and 30 in the west, resulting in $500 and $600 million in revenue in these regions.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcash’s high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the eastern states mainly to Ald and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA’s customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash’s food and food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016; 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, so its market share will fall from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent in 2020.
Hamish Douglass, the manager of the leading investment fund last week and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could “very possibly lose in a decade.”
Metcash has refused to publicly respond to Douglass' comments.
However, it is understood that a member of Metcash's government had contacted Douglas last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18% after 2010 to 14%, and revenues from Metcashi’s food and food business, which distributes products to approximately 1200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43% since 2012. This indicates a decrease in the volume of operations and a decrease in the volume of sales, the decrease in the volume of sales and the volume of sales.
However, the wholesaler keeps his side, and has invested more than $150 million annually in lowering the prices of hundreds of products weekly to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers to repair their stores by increasing the amount of crude oil produced by the fastest growing sea.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says that price reductions and the improvement of stores have increased their attractiveness, and he hopes that wholesalers will return to the path of revenue growth in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australian Tennis Federation President Steve Healy to Support Thanasi Cooks
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism of his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer side by side in a recent storm that has been raging around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more honor than criticism of his own behavior, says Steve Heal, president of the Australian Tennis Association.
Younger member of the duo Kokkinakis, called "Special Ks", was inadvertently made public in the case in which Kyrgios upset Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly after that, in a knockout game in Cincinnati, the Chief Justice had to split the Cooks and his opponent Ryan Harrison from each other twice, when Harrison declared, "Wawrinkan should have hit Kyrgios, and I should have hit that cockroach."
Although Kokkinakis was last seen breaking his knee after the cramping stole his potential win at the Richard Gasquet US Open, Healy has been Kokkinakis’s undisputed defender.
Right now, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for second place in two games with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
"I'm pretty strong in the opinion that Thanasi is just being dragged into the trash," Healy said.
He broke his knee by losing to the cramp at the U.S. Open, but he’s not the first player to break his knee when he’s frustrated, and I know Thanas well enough to know he’s not proud of it.
But he's behaved very well, even in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a kick.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he has been treated a little hard.
He is very mature at 19 years old, he works hard, fits in with the team and so on, and he has never had problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he exercises strongly, is in good condition and is quite calm and mature, he is very young
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgyz in key games starting on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good solution for everyone, but still supported the Canberra return to the team's regulars.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the polemics around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as for example, Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he's grown up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets. However, we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him, we're trying to make sense of it, we're trying to make sense of it.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border against Serbia, while detaining those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of undermining the flow of migrants coming to the country.
The border was followed by chaos when hundreds of migrants gathered in a non-partisan area, and the Serbian authorities reacted with a squabble.
The people who fled the violence of their homelands have now set up their tents and settled for an indefinite period of time on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries.
However, the disillusionment increased.
While the police helicopter was standing above them, the migrants chanted "Open the Border!" and shouted insults to the Hungarian police.
Some refused to eat or drink food and water to protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister said it was “impossible” to accept the return of migrants from Hungary as more migrants arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, does not cause harm to civilians.
We need to have a discussion with other countries and Brussels in the coming days,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The conflict on the border between Hungary and Serbia came about after the 28-nation group failed to meet in Brussels at a contentious meeting of the common immigration policy.
The ministers agreed on the responsibility of the 40,000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and they were hopeful that the final agreement would be reached - next month or by the end of next year - on what EU countries will take in an additional 120,000 refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an additional EU summit next Tuesday to discuss the country’s immigration crisis.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
On Tuesday, the state of emergency in two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in a crisis and allowed you to be closed and asylum cases to be expedited.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is ready, the country will also be able to set up a part of the pikes against its border against Romania to stop the influx of migrants across the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners had been recruited to complete a loophole between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the biggest bottleneck and destination for refugees in the European Union, many of whom are fleeing war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees in search of a better life, and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly opposed to that of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now define a crime as an attempt to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) spiked wire fence built by the government on the southern border against Serbia, and contain longer prison sentences for convicted people.
“Because of the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency,” Zoltan Kovacs, a government spokesman, told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on this: crossing the legal border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve next week's expected military deployment, but the Associated Press's journalists at the border have seen heavy-armed military personnel in vehicles and dogs for days already.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban’s national security adviser, said authorities had arrested 45 people as they tried to cross the border, as well as 15 already longer conditions in the country.
They got over by damaging the fence, are now being held by the police, and are accused of violations defined in the new laws.
The authorities will fix the damage quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossings from Serbia’s border on Tuesday morning after they sent a train covered with a spike belt to close one of these crossings.
The main crossing point near Hungary’s Roszke was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for the treatment of people and crowds penetrated.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left outside.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorways between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse to eat and drink until they were allowed to come to Hungary.
2016 election: National poll says Hillary Clinton’s leadership to Bernie Sanders has narrowed down
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will continue to lead the Democratic nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders has arrested him.
Clinton now supports 47 per cent of Democrats (down from 58 per cent) and Sanders, the second, supports 27 per cent (down from 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will run for president, but he is in favour of 15 percent of Democrats.
More than five months before the elections begin, most of the Democratic voters say it is too early to say who they would have decided who to vote for.
Clinton’s supporters, however, stand behind their own choices more closely than the supporters of other candidates.
Clinton’s popularity has declined in several population groups since last month’s CBS News Poll poll, and at the same time Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but her leadership has been strained.
His popularity among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders has only 5 percentage points left.
Clinton’s run-in with under 50-year-old Democratic voters has been lost, and she is now on a level with Sanders.
Clinton, however, is clearly leading the way with her parents.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders with a double-digit number for the Liberals, but now Sanders leads this group at five percentage points.
About half of the country’s Democratic voters say they will support Clinton with enthusiasm if she becomes a candidate for the party.
A quarter says they support him on certain reservations, and 15 percent would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
It is not very surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are very likely to be enthusiastic about her support.
Opinions are more confusing for those who do not currently support Clinton - only a quarter would support him with enthusiasm.
While 48 percent of Democrats say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, 35 percent say the same about Donald Trump, a Republican first-in-command.
When Clinton’s supporters were asked why they wanted her to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that she had a suitable experience (16%). After that, the most popular answers were that now is the right time for the female president (13%) and that she should be the best candidate (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned her connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
The same views as well as the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Because the vice president is affected by a possible presidential nomination, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - even if the third party disagrees.
Asking Democratic voters who they would choose for the second party nomination, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton’s supporters, more than half say they chose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue a Democratic nomination, Hilary Clinton's leadership grows from Sanders. If Biden leaves, the leadership is 20 percentage points, but if he leaves, the figure is 30.
Fifty-five percent of Democrats believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but that figure has fallen from 78 percent last month.
At this scale, Biden remains far away, but the share of those who consider him to be the most vocal has increased.
When asked what is the most important thing about the candidate, however, they raised their views on the issue of voter turnout.
Also, in the last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, do well in certain key issues among their party’s voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest, trustworthy, and strong leaders.
Biden succeeds in the best of the three in honesty, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democrats say they don’t think Clinton is fair and trustworthy, which is twice as much as Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent say they don’t have an opinion about Sanders.
Democrats, in general, also consider that Clinton, Sanders and Biden share ideologically the same view.
When we look at all of these things, about a quarter of Democrats say they have no opinion on Sanders.
While Hillary Clinton’s use of her personal email address and server while she’s the Secretary of State continues to raise questions, the majority of Democratic voters are happy with her explanation of the matter and say that it didn’t affect their public opinion of her.
However, this is different when we look at America as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The people’s views were shared in March shortly after it came to light.
The vast majority of Americans say the email polemic did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, even though 36 percent say their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton’s own party voters consider him to be honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32 percent consider him to be honest and reliable, and after this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points to 15 percentage points in the last one month.
62% of registered voters say they do not consider Clinton to be fair and reliable.
At the same time, 55 per cent of the country’s registered voters also do not consider Trump to be fair and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson, and Bush are considered to be more honest.
Sanders is generally considered fair, but many have no opinion of him, much like Carson.
The margin of error in the survey, involving 351 Democratic voters, is 6%.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
In the new poll, two candidates collected half of all votes, leaving the others to fight for the pedestrian.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favor of Trump, whose support has risen to 27% of the CBS poll released Tuesday, ahead of last month’s Fox News poll.
At the same time, however, Carson rose sharply from six per cent to 23 per cent.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is being marginalized among Trump’s highly-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field has been left behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's support has fallen the most: from last month's 10% to the current 2%.
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are at 6%.
The margin of error for this latest poll, conducted in September, in the sample of 376 Republican voters, is +/- 6 %.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson is on the rise in polls: he has a 19 percent support for Republicans, and Trump has a 32 percent lead.
Also according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was significantly ahead of Carson.
As Carson’s popularity rose last week, Trump criticized retired neurosurgeons for being useless, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday on his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of First-Year Student at Baruch College
Almost two years after the student died at the fraternity's symphony ceremony in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, the murder case has been raised against five people.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed his hospitalization, thus contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities say Deng’s eyes were tied and his back was loaded with over a 13-kilogram backpack full of sand, after which he was repeatedly tackled to the ground as he tried to walk across the ice field towards the finish line.
Finally, Deng complained that his head was hurting, after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Brotherhood did not call the emergency number after Deng turned around, but the charges said they waited an hour before bringing him to the hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, look online for information about his symptoms, and contact the Brotherhood’s national president, Andy Mengi, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide their ritual equipment and then practically put the fraternity’s well-being ahead of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
Deng was not allowed to serve, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was hit repeatedly by a blunt object on the head, body, and legs.
“Too many families have suffered from fraternal concussion, when at least one student has died annually as a result since 1970,” Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step taken by the authorities is important.
A large jury in Monroe County said the first five members were charged with a third-degree murder.
32 other members of the fraternity, including Meng, are also charged with violent embezzlement and criminal conspiracy.
“We don’t want to be held accountable only by individuals. If there’s an organization behind it that accepts the situation either officially or informally, they should be held accountable,” Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood from breaking its ties to the local division.
This Is What Happens When the U.S. Central Bank Raises Interest Rates
The interest rate hike is coming, and the market for rising rates is falling, bond yields are rising, and the economy is falling.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long this will take or how long it will take.
The past is hardly helping with timing, as far as the economy is concerned.
The recession has only lasted 11 months since the first recession, and sometimes it has lasted as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the U.S. central bank in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why the officials of the U.S. Central Bank have so forcefully stressed that investors should not focus on it because interest rates are starting to rise, but mainly on the development of the period leading up to the normalisation of the situation.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, the market participants may find that all the harvests related to the rate of interest have been oversaturated.
“The central bank’s first post-global economic crisis increase is inevitably interpreted in some circles as the end of the ‘bad money’ era,” said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal, albeit still low, levels to be the kind of revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it will not have an impact.
Below is a look at how some parts of the economy will react on the basis of previous developments:
As has been seen on the market over the last about a month, waiting for a rate hike can make the situation unstable.
When the increase comes true, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
“It seems that the return on capital tends to stop for 12-24 months after the first increase, which in turn potentially reflects the delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the central bank’s increase.
More specifically, over the last 35 years, the market has generally been in a strong position, with an increase of around 14 per cent in Management as we approach the increase, 250 days after that the situation is quite flat (average increase of 2.6 per cent), and the normal situation has been reached 500 days after the decline of the average yield of the stock, with a decrease of 14 per cent in the previous month
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is usually clearer at a later stage of the increase cycle when revenues start to fall.
Recessions are a part of economic life, but corrosives often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not previously been faced and that can accelerate the recession.
This is particularly the gross national product, which will be the closest to its all-time low before the central bank's interest rate rises.
According to Deutsche Bank, the nominal annual GDP in the 118 increases made since 1950 has only been less than 4.5%.
While the figure in the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few believe it will remain as the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 per cent, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve.
The interest rate hike in such a fragile economic situation can be risky and raises the question of "is this time different", Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants are expected to increase the central bank throughout the year, and all are awaiting this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, futures trading predicted only a 25% probability.
“Our research shows that since 1950, all of the increase cycles have so far been in the increasing leverage over supercycles where GDP has surpassed pre-recession peaks very quickly after recovery has begun,” the report says.
On the contrary, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the decline, which has been the worst of the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been waiting too long for the last recession to end: the record has been 35 months, and it is now in its 74th month.
Fixed return has also been unstable when the market is waiting for an increase in interest rates, and the model is somewhat reminiscent of the observations made on capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects appear more quickly in bonds than in shares.
The yield direction of the bonds appears to change immediately at the first increase/slicing of the cycle.
At the end of the recovery cycle, the yield of the bonds will decrease immediately,” Deutche Bank said.
The Charles Schwab strategies believe that the interest rate hike will lead to a convergence of long- and short-term bond yields, thereby leveling the yield curve.
High-quality bond yields are often better in such a situation, even though “we are still cautious about looking for income,” said Schwab’s fixed-income analyst Kathy Jones in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank’s policy proposals.
“In addition to the decline in dollar strength and inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the view of tighter monetary policy,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, the yield curve is smoother, credit margins have increased and volatility has increased - all of these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its alignment.
In general, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt are performing worse when the rise in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have finance.
“History shows that ‘quality’ shares are generally the most profitable in the three months following the first interest rate,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer-oriented report.
After the 1994, 1999 and 2004 increases, companies with strong turnover exceeded weak turnover by an average of five percentage points after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 increases.
Companies with a high return on capital and low volatility stocks performed better than low-quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage units) and 3 (percentage units) above.
Debt becomes a big problem.
Those companies that have a lot of variable-rate debt are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside of stock market manipulation, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Even savers can make a profit with higher returns, even though experts disagree about how quickly the effect feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, Rep. Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "nationalisation"
He argues that its separation from a commercial competitor is becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, he addressed the BBC Music Awards saying that they only traveled to the Brit Awards.
Rep. Damien Collins criticized The Voice as saying it was not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is “turning” to Classic FM, claims the leading public representative in addition to the pressure of the production company to prove that it is doing something that commercial production companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC’s leaders that the public service radio channel seemed to “popularize” its content, and that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish it from a commercial competitor.
"It seems like Radio 3 - I wouldn't want to use the term 'nationalize' - is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also starred in the BBC Music Awards, which was launched in December last year.
“The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, only have a different impact on the Brit Awards.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples that I directly remember when you actually just copied something that’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC’s chief executive denied the allegations, saying that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competition partner in terms of live music and sharing information to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can’t learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, top-notch.
“In addition, I think it is really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 boss Alan Davey claimed that the channel needs to do more work than before to reach the public, as the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC’s offer that was criticized for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearings of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins criticized The Voice, a music contest the BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and it is not in any way self-titled?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced "in the style of the BBC".
He added that he wants the production company to “find success inside his own house” next time it starts the entertainment series.
However, he did not agree to prevent the production of future The Voice seasons, or to order that the money of the licensee be used in other entertainment formats.
Online sales so far soared the least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Online sales increased by 7% in the first three months of 2015
In the last month, the increase was the lowest since the start of the statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales strengthened the use of mobile devices to make purchases
Experts believe that Black Friday may be slowing down consumption in November
The practice of virtual shopping has grown tremendously for over a decade and has transformed many of Britain’s shopping streets into a ghost town.
However, experts say that there are signs of net sales levelling in the air now, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August increased at least since the start of the statistics in 2000: only five per cent increase from last year.
Experts say there are signs of net sales levelling in the air, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
“If we look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would make sense over time,” Andy Mulcahy, JMRG’s sales index provider, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales were strengthened when buyers began to use their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people made purchases online, and that they could be made in different environments, such as on the couch.
But now it's leveling up, and (growth) can count.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, has been seen as one of the reasons behind slowing trade.
Experts believe that consumers will be able to control the making of purchases before the last Friday of November.
Last year, an average of five times as many buyers boarded their computers to intercept trades covering the websites of many of their traders.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which caused buyers to argue over the findings, can control the making of purchases
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one in five pounds was used online.
With regard to certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of using the fashion chains of shopping streets.
Muslims Bury Dead in Mecca Uprising Crash, Bin Laden's Family Sentences
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has partly blamed the collapse of the construction waste Saudi Binladi Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured when the crane collapsed.
29 The dead were carried through the streets when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, and the victims died when a bull fell in the Great Mosque of Mecca.
Mostly white-clad survivors filled the route to honor the first of the dead who made their last trip to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The sad walk passed through the holy place, where just a few days ago the bull fell through the roof of the mosque and fell down the servants.
The bodies were freed to be buried when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed the Bin Laden family’s building group was responsible for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
29 bodies were carried across the streets by worshippers of those who died in the Great Mosque of Mecca.
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram from Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when a thunderstorm broke out.
Akram had been in a large mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already vowed that the chaos in Mecca will continue when thousands of people arrive in the city on an ongoing basis.
King Salman said today that Binladi Group should not be left up for the lift when it was not in use.
In an Arabic-language version of the decision, the government-run Saudi Press Agency said Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not mention this detail, but it said that the company’s executives have been banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what led to the fall of the escalators in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before later this month’s Hajj pilgrimage.
Binladin Group has not published any reports of the collapse of the evil and its representatives have not been arrested for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the association of not using the current means of protection and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
Around the mosque, there are dozens of pickpockets, which are part of a huge building raid led by Binladin Group.
Binladin’s family has been close to Saudi Arabia’s ruling family for decades, and it leads major construction projects.
Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida, was an insurgent son whose family was banned in the 1990s.
The fallout occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions came to the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which every able-bodied Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered one million riyals (174,000 pounds) to be paid to the families of the dead and the permanently injured.
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
B&Q boss says workers working cheaply in Eastern Europe are behind the popularity
The British are increasingly using the services of assistants, says Veronique Laury
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is on the rise
As a result, professional-oriented Screwfix stores will open up to 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author Rupert Steiner, editor-in-chief of the city for the Daily Mail
Britons are said to give up their summers and paintbrushes and prefer to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do patriotic work
It looks like if you’re stuck with a vase or want to paint walls, you’re now in the minority.
The British are increasingly hiring assistants to do tea-self-care at their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the home repair package, said that the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is behind the popularity and that they offer their services at a ridiculous price.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for men and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said she wants more women to work in B&Q stores because eight out of ten shopping decisions made in stores are made by the most beautiful gender.
Today, most of the staff are men.
He said that the changes in the population must be taken into account: today there is more than one woman's household, where more domestic work is done than before.
Laury said: “Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the purchasing decisions for products are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.”
Laury is one of only five women to lead the UK FTSE100 index’s most important companies. She has rebuilt her management team in such a way that it has as many men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company with 50 percent of the women in the group, including its CEO and chief financial officer.
Laury said: "This was an informed decision - the difference is an important thing here.
It wasn’t hard to find good women in the management team.”
Kingfisher announced a cut in both half-year revenues and sales after the group took down the costs of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new stores
In three stages, the government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the country’s economy.
The visible effects were achieved quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other wage-earner organisations began to force the same way, and as a result, the country stands on Friday due to the widespread sentiment of the workers.
A lot of people think that makes sense, too.
Ask yourself if it’s worth it when things go wrong.
Resistance organizations have even been established.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the Internet to announce that they are not going to participate in a mental statement but are going to work.
Such a good consensus would have been impossible in the old days.
Of course, there was no internet to protest, but openly declaring to be rich would have been the political suicide of a small human being.
The protests of a few tens of thousands of people in the millions-member trade unions do not take long, but the reason for thinking it gives.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement in their own right, the values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the government’s narrow solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
When things have seemed to roll by their own weight for years, the unions will finally get to the point, that is, the workers' rights to defend, visibly and properly.
In this way, the government may want to capture the role of the moon movement when membership in the trade union is seen as perhaps more necessary than before.
Whatever the organization’s actions, it’s a shame that Friday’s sentiment would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped for some time now.
For example, industrial production has been declining for 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product continues to decline and unemployment continues to rise.
These things would seem to force everyone's head.
The University of Lappeenranta’s hard-earned savings: target of 8.5 million savings, reduced staff by 130
The Lappeenranta University of Technology is launching a savings fund with a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.5 million to cover costs.
As part of the savings, the university will start the overall staff-related core negotiations, with an annual saving target of 6.5 million.
In practice, it means a reduction of about 130 employees.
In addition, other activities are aimed at saving two million.
Against the background of the CT negotiations, there is a 2016 budget, which forecasts a deficit of 8.5 million for the actual operation.
This is also influenced by the government’s budget cuts.
During this period, the university will produce approximately 2.6 million in outstanding results.
The costs will increase slightly for next year, but at the same time the funding received from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and the other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The total budget of the university is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The joint impact of massive interventions in teaching and research, as well as the reduction of corporate funding, on our university is very significant, says Rector Anneli Pauli in a statement from the University.
Before the summer, the effects of the surgery were even more modest, but now the reduction in supplementary funding appears in new proportions.
Negotiations with the trustees will begin next Tuesday and will last for six weeks as required by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland’s railways
The owner of Onnibus, Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also planning rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining the Finnish Rail Transport Association.
Stagecoach is one of the UK’s largest rail companies, Souter says.
Rail transport is to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is the proximity of the metropolitan area in 2017-2018.
After close-up traffic, there is a long-distance traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Ylen, the Ministry of Transport welcomes the plans of Onnibus.
At least Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe, has indicated its interest in rail transport from other international companies.
The U.S. central bank must make decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world follows suit when the U.S. central bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
When Reuters surveyed 80 economists, just over half of those who believed the central bank was raising interest rates last week, now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and the interest rate is at the current level of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, because since the central bank cut interest rates to zero, it has been seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of the zero level and start normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well, and recovery has brought in trillions of dollars and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market that they should be ready for a raise, but the signs also show them that they believe the odds are against an increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 8 p.m. (CET).
Delta State University Shooter Leaves Apology Message
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before shooting his colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying he was “sorry” about the first murder and hoped “that we could cancel it,” officials said Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier police said that Delta State University geography and social sciences teacher Lamb called the emergency number at about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the respondent that the police had to send the interrogations to his home.
He said he "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there is a "sweet dog" in the house that "doesn't bother anyone" but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller the name, but he didn't tell her.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for the shooting.
When the police arrived, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten message from 45-year-old Lamb, which read: "I'm so sorry I wish I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who has ever loved me.”
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed historian Ethan Schmidt, before eventually killing himself late Monday as police surrounded him.
University principal William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt to know him, but that "there was clearly something in Lamb's mind".
Authorities said on Tuesday that despite the allegations published on Monday that Lamb had believed Prentiss was in relation to Schmidt, there was "no information or evidence" of any kind of "triadrama".
Shawn O'Steen said he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a "good person".
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is "shocked".
O'Steen said that Prentiss and his daughter were "sometime best friends".
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss worked hand in hand at home online. According to the Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles reported that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lambi called his relatives sometime on Monday to tell them that "he's not going to jail".
When police reached Lamb's Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there, and ran into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about the science of education in the Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to the university’s website.
The Stars Who Lost Their Attractiveness
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001 he suffered from leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to rumors, he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of these really require a tax.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw has been out for months due to a double-deal
Luke Shaw got a double-deal on his right foot when Manchester United lost to PSV Eindhoven in a Champions League match.
Although the defender has been in tears for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
Vamman caused Héctor Moreno's deadlock in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated for 9 minutes on the field and had to be given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture in his leg and he's in the hospital now."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then cut in Manchester.
This is terrible. The boy comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, suffers from difficulties and then plays brilliantly, and now this is how it is.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but it takes at least half a year for a twin to break, and he doesn't play in the block phase.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got either a red card and a penalty shot.
Violator Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Mr Van Gaal suggested that the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge the situation by saying that it was a penalty shootout and a red card.
It was a really bad two-legged tie.
Shaw tweeted: “Thanks to all of your messages, words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I will come back stronger.”
Related: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and loses to PSV
The English defender will have the European Championship in France next June as an additional incentive to recover.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, “It’s really bad.”
If any player gets out because of such an injury, everyone is very sad.
The goal of our players is never to offend an opponent.
Moreno’s leg broke when he played for Mexico’s Van Gaal against Holland in the 2014 World Cup.
“Moreno takes this seriously because it’s not meant to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it’s a bad thing,” Cocu said.
I didn't see it in that situation.
The only thing I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] was touching it, but I didn’t see Luke missing.
Moreno told SBS6: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel terrible about it, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after being challenged by Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know Lorax better?
Every parent soon learns one thing: if your child loves a book, it won’t last long before it learns almost from the outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When a childcare service asked the Prime Minister for his favorite book, he chose Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes on the SuperCamps website in a post and continues: "Laughter, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I enjoyed reading this book to my children because it always feels like a picture or a message that we haven't seen before."
All of this is true, but the next paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details were added to fill a fairly short original text.
“In the city of Tarville, where all nature has been lost and even air is a commodity, Ted-boy hopes to win over the heart of his dream girl by fulfilling Audrey’s desire to see the real tree,” the text says and describes the love story of Theo, who was born in 1991.
If this isn’t suspicious enough, Cameron’s text sounds like it’s taken from the plot summary of the Lorax movie from the Internet Movie Database, which begins as follows: “In the city of Needle, within the walls, where everything is in the air, there will be plenty of space to go.”
Considering that Cameron is publicly active as a parent". It seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. In it, a young, anonymous son hears how the local nature has destroyed the greedy, the wood-cutter and the need for a flourishing grove of groves, the gaps in the groves of the grove, the gaps in the groves
Such a relatively invisible PR assignment is probably outsourced to an assistant who has apparently never read the book 20 times in a row to a child.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said the text appears to have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at the time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of staying away from the England team, but it was still a tough spot
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for the tour, I don’t think it’s likely to repeat the last 3-0 series loss.
I wouldn't even close a visitor's winnings off the bills.
The side of Alastair Cook may have been less experienced than the team three years ago, but it involves good rounds and the team’s way of thinking is strong: they don’t have a scar from 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali is developing in his rounds and Adil Rashid is an attacking option, although he is an unknown factor at this level.
Adam Lyth drops out of England cricket team, replaces Alex Hales
“The decision to leave Adam Lyth on the team is clearly difficult for me to analyze because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against attackers in challenging conditions, and the simple but tough truth is that cricketers are judged on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root’s choice before the announcement, because, as I’ve said before, players are the best choice makers.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season on the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come along.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he didn't perform as well as he could, and it didn't surprise me.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long it will take to leave a trace.
Lyth was selected seven times for the national team, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Only Compton was given the opportunity to play both at home and abroad.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in the top tier, but that missed opportunity is now past.
Alex Hales is coming along, and there's a punch I appreciate.
As a cricketer, he has something that we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as the others before him, but this certainly depends on the formation of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen in the opening match beside Cook has been balled up, which would give the field an extra feeder but could hold four fast, and I am not against that.
I don't understand why you can't beat him there, and this left-handed guy has already proven himself to be quite a cricketer.
Moe may not have done her duty in her county of Worcestershire, but she's three for them and there's not much difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games in the first slow down, before moving into the opening in 2001.
He immediately scored three hundred points and did not remember the past.
Zafar Ansari will join the team as a predator, and, the little I have been dealing with him, he feels very impressive from a young man.
People can look at his unauthenticated statistics – hitting the average of 31, with a ball with 35 – and think it’s a gamble, but there aren’t too many feeders on offer and voters chose young people.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside of the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawarden as a game consultant may prove to be a necromancer.
He is one of the most comfortable friends in the game, and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the White Ball games, bringing with him both energy and an unforgivable distraction.
I’ve always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it was playing or training, and he has the same exploitative talent as Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is laid off in one day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have at least no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, the coaches and the selectors do not make schedules.
And you have to remember that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be made on a light basis.
Britain’s exit from the EU (Brexit) beneficiaries could lead to a profit if the economy is in trouble in 2017
David Cameron’s half-hearted renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU face ever-greater problems every day, even if he did not take into account the hearty Jeremy “Is it yes or no?” Corbyn’s choice to lead the Labour Party or the European Union’s roadblocks.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Faragens.
A European diplomatic friend recently explained that, because the EU is so deep in various crises, all of which are not its own reasons, some Member States are fed up with the self-centred agenda of Britain, which is full of disagreements, disagreements and disagreements.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Organisation of Trade Unions decided that they would not want them if they were to crack down on social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of State for Finance are late for the summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of the famous local memorial, either with or without a local eye-catcher, and then come home and say that they can swim.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside the UK inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France", Berlin says - suggests that the shortest-sighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at such a point that they will not leave us.
German conservative and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her office before it goes to the castle in the same way that it happened to the late Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Holland is facing re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a power out there, too.
Poland may have a nationalist right-wing government, a left-wing one in Spain.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing on behalf of the selfie Brits, when their energy should rather be directed to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - they do not want it because of similar separate tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of such ministers may even consciously plan to make useless remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
“Renegotiations had been arranged,” and “Renegotiations had no relevance to Britain.”
The Europeans have had a vivid experience of how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how sceptical the press are, what they were not, inspired by Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, when our membership, which began in 1973, was strengthened.
They can dimly remember Boris Johnson, the biggest Euro-opportunist, who made a name for himself by writing “The EU’s direct bananas” while being Brussels’s mail-changer in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a writing group of tax-exempt wizards, phone hacking foreigners, and people whose domicile is nominally elsewhere and who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same about them, but realized that if you’re stuck with a skinny gorilla, you have to give up bananas for the sake of being shy if you don’t want to be on that gorilla’s lunch list and later on dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more blair-like than Blair himself when it came to countering Cameron's renegotiation; Bair had joined the principle behind the rejected EU Constitution, which the French and Dutch voters rejected in 2005, thus giving up the Blaisin vote.
The press never forgave him for that.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who kindly patted me on the back of the Westminster House of Commons on Monday (I told him he no longer has time to waste on me), seemed to be in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's 80s strategy of boycotting the Murdochik strike, which was a crime.
Although it may take some time, he has to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but no doubt with Andrew Marri, who left the BBC on Sunday with Corbyn.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it mildly, evolving.
He says he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Well, most of the people of the United Kingdom’s independence party outside of the Ukip war-mongering and the fiercest nationalists of the Conservative Party can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fan" Benn said so on both radio and TV this week, when his inner partymate would have wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint a charismatic John McDonnell as the shadow government's Treasury Secretary was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70’s when his father was on TV trying to be disloyal to his colleagues in the Labour Party without going so far as to lose his seat of government.
Hilary's coatings were more attractive.
But the fight for staying in a "situation anywhere" - Benn's statement - was not what McDonnell said, and certainly not what Corbyn told the chiefs and MPs in a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the non-hierarchical, emotional and personal image Corbyn wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the era of everyday TV, and especially for social media circles, whether it’s on a whim or on a whim.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to keep the support of the Labour Party in the referendum campaign clear of himself.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
But the fundamental dispute between McDonnell and Corbyn over EU membership (and, therefore, in line with their Benn-minded regulatory economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate among left-wing thinkers who have little respect for women.
As for his bipartisanship with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby did not campaign to surrender), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to their bosses.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital (they too have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it can be completely unnecessary?
The United States has already been somewhat disappointed by the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when the cost-cutting Conservative government is in power, as I was reminded at the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts Criticize Public Health England's Electric Cigarette Ratings
The researchers have said that the government-funded agency’s claim that electric cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than traditional ones originated from a meeting of 12 people, with some links to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed with Lancet on the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) critics in their report on the power outage.
PHE published this "high-pitched" report last month, describing it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of the data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published a main article that criticized the PHE’s main decision on the “extraordinary humerus base”.
Two other BMJ researchers have considered whether the claims are “built on rock or sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: “The main principle of public health is that activities must be based on proven effectiveness.”
They say the public expects that PHE’s claim “according to the current best estimate, electric cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes” is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from a meeting of 12 people that developed a multi-criteria analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on the adverse effects associated with different nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were consolidated into the study.
McKee and Capewell say one of the meeting’s sponsors was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is reported to have previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT’s public health credentials in the sustainability report, they say.
One in 12 people at the meeting said they received funding from the manufacturer of the electric cigarette, but not from Philip Morris International, a tobacco company, they added.
While the selection criteria for panel members are not disclosed, the panel includes a number of well-known proponents of the electric bill, some of whom also report on the funding received in the field of research.
Others who have been there are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco director of PHE.
The study, produced by the group, “multilingually admits” that there is a lack of “irrefutable evidence regarding the adverse effects of most products and most of the criteria,” McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE’s claims that “there is currently no evidence that the electric shock pack acts as a pathway for smoking in children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Welfare at PHE, said the allegations made at BMJ had been answered in the past.
He says, “Electricity packs are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
Half of the people who burned their lives will die of their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks caused by the power outage are comparatively low, but we need to continue to investigate the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it doesn’t show, especially when compared to the relative dangers of smoking there is so much public ignorance.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion annually.
By explaining the current evidence - i.e., even though electric cigarettes are not risk-free, their harms are only a fraction of the harms of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibilities.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" to such a slow-moving soap opera as this Albert Square, for example.
Johnson said that the licensing fees should only be used to make programs that other UK broadcasters do not.
He criticized the BBC for putting in place public service programs that are likely to have a smaller audience, challenging broadcast times against competitors’ most popular programs and channels such as the BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more closely with other organizations, Johnson said that he had been working on Channel 4 for six years to establish a relationship with the BBC, to no avail.
“I don’t understand the idea that the BBC produces and sends programs that were clearly suitable for unsubsidized competitors,” Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of its investigation into the BBC’s future.
If the licence fee is adhered to - and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this message or in the long run - it should at least limit its production to programs that others do not and will not.
The Voice will be sent to the most important broadcast time because it wants to gather as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would look like a program, is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why a regressive tax should be funded by programs that could also be funded without state support.
The Voice is one such and EastEnders another, unprohibitedly implemented inside the house.
In other words, the other channels would give any of it.
I don't understand what it's like to send a public service.
“I don’t think it would weaken the BBC at all.”
Channel 4's director of the series, Johnson, said the BBC blames viewers for hunting "because of the goals of people working there, and because they believe it's the best way to achieve long-term support."
He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC would sell such series as EastEnders, which is the most popular series in the BBC.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller public service programs "go to the BBC4, where it is often impossible to measure the viewership, but the BBC thus fulfills its responsibilities and can then falsely state when defending the <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion promised revenue" that 'surely, if we don't know all about it, we'll know all about it.
They put them in a place where no one will ever look at them.
Johnson told the committee: “I’m asking you to look for a more regressive system in which to get the most out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think that <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year gets a lot of money, but I don’t know if it’s right for people who have <0xC2><0xA3>150 because they don’t use the BBC much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who also testified to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should re-evaluate its early mission to “inform, educate and entertain” Reith.
He said that only a small part of BBC production is currently classified as education - he said the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take a model from Australian and Canadian radio stations and change the mission to "information, lighting and entertainment".
With regard to partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he says will be shown on television only to some, and allied with commercial companies so that all of them can be seen online.
"Audio genetics" allows the control of brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the sock pads change direction as soon as the sound impulse hits them.
Researchers have bred worms that have genetically modified nervous systems so that they can be controlled by sound wave bursts.
The tiny sound waves change direction as soon as a sound pulse hits them, which is too high for the human ear to hear.
Impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion brain cells with ultrasonic wave-responsive film channels.
Related: Researchers Read and Write Brain Activity in Light <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The researchers said that the worms demonstrate the functionality of a new method, called sound genetics. In it, ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the method could one day replace deep-brain stimulation. It is an invasive procedure in which people’s brains are led to electrical impulses to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Succulents do not normally respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when surrounded by a liquid with a microscopic small bubble, the situation changed.
He noticed that the domes strengthened the ultrasonic waves, which then passed into the carpets.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect TRP-4 ion channels, structures that are present in the cell membranes of some mats.
These ion channels will allow sound waves to open and activate the cells attached to them, according to a report published in the journal Nature Communications.
To produce ultrasound-controlled sock worms, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their musculoskeletal cells have TRP-4 ion channels.
When Chalasani used ultrasound for modified mats, the microwaves strengthened the sound waves and transmitted them to the mats where they connect the modified motion sensors.
The method has some of the same features as optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to connect nerve cells on and off using light pulses.
Chalasani, however, says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light, which must be sent from optical fiber to the desired point inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue without obstruction, so they can be sent to the brain from the skull.
“We believe that using gene therapy and therapeutic virus may be possible to have human nerves subject to instantaneous response to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting,” Chalasani said.
Other application targets could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Ads May Shame on Britain's Arms Trade
Watch Amnesty International’s anti-establishment video.
Terrifying killing machines!
Nipple-breaking footpaths!
Bullet bombs!
And e-suspension pumps that cause painful pain but do not leave traces!
The cheerful sound and imagery of the cartoons leaves no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest stations is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to underline the British government’s willingness to trade weapons for black governments at the Defence and Security Equipment International’s ExCeL Loton Centre.

With the separate campaign, many posters appeared on bus stops and subways, which require more detailed information.
"What's the big deal, do you travel on the DLR route from September 15th to 18th?" together we ask using London's underground font and brand, as the DLR's track turns into a tank image.
This September, a handful of arms dealers arrive on the DLR routes... customers are asked to help stop the stations.
These 300 posters are made by artists whose work was exhibited at Banksy’s Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (the Museum of Jewellery Designs).
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped spread posters around London using the "Ad Space Hack Packs" packages. It is a six-pound package of six-collaborators that, according to the collective, "captures a third of the entire range of bus stops on the planet".
Transport for London is not interested in this unpromising "public vandalism".
One of the parody ads produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Cruel Designs curator and University of Essex lecturer Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and want to take political work to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists have begun to work with activists in opposition campaigns when they have realized that they have to go abroad if they want their art to affect society.
Another anti-army poster greets commuters on the subway.
Amnesty video has been viewed more than 100,000 times over the last 24 hours via Facebook. It was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and also a graphic designer and background artist worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever found that the show was not advertised at all – and also ExCeL’s calendar was empty at the time – and thought: “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the idea of a more realistic advertising of a shadowy corporation, but "it was more perspicuous to emphasize it with bright colors and animation."
“They’ve done a fantastic job helping us raise questions about the illegal torture device that sells at fairs,” said Amnesty’s Tom Davies.
Now the government of the United Kingdom must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art of the show will come from the inside of ExCeL when the exhibitors are trading fantastically embellished products.
In a press release, Saab received an order from the U.S. military for "the AT4CS RS firing from the side".
This includes "a unique pipe-injection barrier that targets excellent effects on the back of the armor inside the object".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student-residential home
It's been 11 years since I changed my student residence unconsciously at the age of 19, when I still believed in bartenders and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the people's smiles and numerous, long complaints from others.
Much of my learning can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a living room can be absolutely scary from anything that happens to nerves.
It’s tempting to gossip: tell me where you’re from, whether you liked the middle of the year and where you think about Corbyn, and why “I really don’t love or hate Marmite because it’s really just a sneak peek HAHA I find in my room”.
Take a breath.
And also help others to breathe - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and not the ones you wouldn’t want to talk to even if your eyelids were on fire and they would share switches.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into cocktail-halls, sipping places, and most of the time, but they’re also places where people dress up and fix their underwear.
Related: Don’t even imagine starting a university when you’re in a relationship
The university is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but in many apartments there is a culture of walking from room to room, which is friendly, social and causes lifelong friendships.
It can mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture gives you permission to say, “I like you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now that I can collect back the energy I spent talking to you.”
Try to sense when a student friend is tired of socializing - and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
Turn off when it comes to talking: turn off.
One guy in my student dorm room thought that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw a lot of things.
Friendship through bread.
Because you’re starting a university at the peak of the baking trend, people’s coping with chocolate chipboard and self-presentation seem to be somewhat less strange, less “welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile when I ask you a personal question50.
Providing self-made flavors is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obligated to talk, and it may be that they will continue to combine your face with a tasty surprise.
The truth depends on whether you know bread.
The carefully blended powdered sugar-fatty wipes are likely to make people only pretend to sleep when they hit.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Understandably, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take a drop of milk for your tea?
Ask and check the owner of the milk.
It is quite possible that they will give you permission, even if they swirl inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to treat it more adult than my roommate, who mixed the detergent into his milk to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You don’t have to pretend that people aren’t allowed to sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that babbling cat.
The girl on my visit asked her neighbors if they could play drums and bass music later because it was three o’clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally shut up at five in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before putting her own music to sleep, locked her door and went to a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same apartment with you?
Or, conversely, wouldn’t it be incredibly annoying if you considered a roommate to be your future spouse, you’d bump into each other, you’d divorce, and then you’d see him every day and possibly lose all your mutual friends to him.
Of course, the heart wants what it wants, but if a hot roommate isn’t really your future spouse, you might even try to talk rationally about your background.
The moment you notice that someone has left their keys unlocked in their room, the line between flirting and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good steak is fun, but it's in a good time.
You can give a useful and fun lesson on safety by hiding something - but never confuse someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and drop the keys into the water glass, which you then put in the freezer - but do not attach their property to the roof of the blue roof as a maximum of twice.
A racist attack on the residence of foreign students in Kiteel - The house planned for reception centre was emptied in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack on the foreign students’ home was carried out in Kitee in North Karelia.
Contrary to what the police said earlier, these are not accommodation facilities for underage asylum seekers, but dormitory rooms for foreign students who have been in Finland for a long time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Kiteen Evangelical National University.
The windows and walls of the National Park’s accommodation were emptied with racist markings, such as hackers, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one accommodation, says the police in Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, who was responsible for the youth social security training at the National Point, ten people were estimated at the time of the attack in the building that was the subject of violence.
“It was the weekend and adult people are free to move, so part could be elsewhere,” Luukkainen says.
The National Academy has accommodation for people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time, as well as asylum seekers who have just arrived.
All those in the mixed building have a-status.
Some are studying in adult primary school, some are in professional studies and some are studying in Finland," Luukkainen says.
A-status is a so-called continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
Police in eastern Finland are investigating the attack as an injury and a breach of home security.
According to the lecturer, the students were given a briefing on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one wanted to leave.
We’ve had 12 years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this has happened,” says Luukkainen.
According to the legend, the mess has already been cleared out of the walls.
The suspects were at least three men and they had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the main focus of the youth weekend, when this topic has now been on the surface.
There’s nothing more serious about it,” says Lukkainen.
There is also an empty hospital in Salo, where a reception centre is planned.
The incident happened last week.
This was reported by MTV on its website on Tuesday evening.
The wall of the hospital was painted with a hooker and written in English "You are not welcome".
A criminal complaint has been filed against the police.
Correction on 15.9. at 16.02 Corrected incorrect information provided by the police regarding the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state will stop the Y-train for Karjaal - passengers in their nostrils, "of course idiotic"
The Y-train, which runs from Helsinki to Karjaala in Raasepor, will stop in March.
The news annoyed passengers who had been on the train at the Helsinki main railway station in the beginning of the year.
In particular, the downfall is striking the parishioners, said Torbj<0xC3><0xB6>rn Bengtstr<0xC3><0xB6>m, who lives in the municipality.
It’s just idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and people who work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This cannot be tied to anything other than political will - or its lack.
Bengtstr<0xC3><0xB6>m says in an interview with HSTV that he will be coming to the capital with a tractor.
There are also train changes in other parts of the country.
The H and R lines running on the base are combined into a new R line.
The position of Purola in J<0xC3><0xA4>rvenp<0xC3><0xA4><0xC3><0xA4> and Nuppulinna in Tuusula is not available.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on which routes the Ministry will buy rail transport in the next contractual period.
The contract period varies over the course of the year and the routes to be cancelled are available throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, to be finalised in autumn, will be approved by the Finance Committee.
Bengtstr<0xC3><0xB6>m believes that the state railway is short-sighted.
Let’s make the same mistakes that we’ve made before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then there will be regret.
Y-trains are also used by non-racial and benevolent people, as it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina P<0xC3><0xB6>yry<0xC3><0xA4>, from Espoo, harassed the fate of travelers further away from the urban area by train.
“It’s especially bad for those who have to plan their trip again,” he said in his distress to Y-juna.
A little relief is allowed.
A new train connection appears to be coming to Randarada, which replaces the Y-juna in Helsinki’s Southern Transport (HSL) area, i.e. it takes up to Kirkkonummel.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for municipalities in the region and their taxpayers.
“Our industry is now exploring different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices,” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs accurately.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about one million per year for the Y-rail, the ministry did much more than that.
By assigning the incoming R-line leaves two positions.
Instead, in Ainolas and Saunakallio, the number of train trips doubles.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes will be closed from the whole country.
The Ministry will no longer buy rail transport from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyv<0xC3><0xA4>skyl<0xC3><0xA4>-Haapam<0xC3><0xA4>ki-Sein<0xC3><0xA4>joki.
The Pieks<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>ki-Joensuu route will be shortened to Pieks<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>ki-Varkaus.
The train lines are reduced on the routes Riihim<0xC3><0xA4>ki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips per year are made with the total number of trips purchased by the ministry in transport being about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring annual savings of 12.3 million to the state.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in Capital's Contemporary: "Marx is worth getting to know"
World economic crises have surfaced Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his main work, published in 1867-1894, is written by Yrj<0xC3><0xB6> Hakanen, known as the former chairman of the SKP, in a book published today in Marx’s Capital Period.
“They’re being taken more seriously now than in a long time,” Hakanen writes in his preface.
Marx’s estimates of the development of the capitalist economy, of internationalisation and penetration into all spheres of life, of the concentration of capital, and of the growing role of capital and imaginary capital have proved to be astonishingly far-fetched.
The author list of the book, based on the main seminars organized by Hakasen, also includes a professor at Aalto University, a respected economist, Sixten Korkman.
In the book, Korkman writes that Marx is a contemporary "now and forever".
However, isn’t the former CEO of the Research Institute of Economic Life and the Embassy of Economic Life a Marxist?
Not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx to be a current economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences are distinct and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and an hour of literature.
“The usual notion is that the myth tells the wrong opinions of the dead men,” Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx’s predictions went horribly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions too far from the initial point of view of capitalism, Korkman thought.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical installation.
“The most relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions,” he says.
Again, we are discussing Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
“Marx may be able to inspire those who want to understand the big picture, the changing world as a result of technical revolution,” Korkman said.
But in what the government should decide tomorrow, there is no help from Marx.
In his view, capitalism was a hopeless case that should only be stopped.
However, Marx believes that Korkman should be known.
“In the 1970s, Marx could not read,” says Korkman.
"The Maori and the Trotskyists and the other peasants hated all capitalism, but even more so each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and even Marx can approach without the ideological and political pressure of the back years.
“Every social scientist should be familiar with Marx’s world of thought – as with other classics,” says Korkman.
U.N. Calls for War Crimes in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate the war crimes committed in the Sri Lankan civil war, the AFP news agency says.
The UN report on the 1983-2009 civil war appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both Sri Lankan armed forces and rebels known as Tamils of war crimes.
Sri Lanka’s civil war is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
There is no precise information on the number of victims.
Especially in the last months of the long war, the major attack by the armed forces in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for.
The Sri Lankan armed forces report accuses of torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely to be the victims as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been accused of forcing the sidelines and children to become fighters.
According to the report, both parties have been charged with murder.
Sri Lanka responded Wednesday that it intends to conduct an investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of a UN court because of foreign judges.
In the English yo-trial, social media was punctuated
In the autumn student writings, on Wednesday, there was a long foreign language, which was mostly English.
His English skills were tested by more than 16,000 coaches.
In the experiment, he could write the material, even from social media.
On the basis of our own experiences, we had to think about whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an English-language 150-250 word script could point to the web page’s advisory board.
Her name was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for Leela's resting chair.
He had to ask for advice on how parents should be able to see things from the perspective of young people.
There were four subjects in total, one of which was to be chosen.
“It was the hardest of them,” said Mia Lybeck, an English lecturer at the Swedish-language school in Porvoo.
The third item was just a quote from Jose Manuel Barroso, the former President of the European Commission.
The fourth point, according to Lybeck, was pretty good.
It was intended to write a fire speech on why companies should hire young people to work.
“At least in our school we’ve been practicing writing speeches,” Lybeck says and assesses the whole experiment as “milk normal.”
In Finnish – or Swedish – the English test was able to answer questions about texts that stemmed from, for example, the adaptation of the summer camp to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday, a somewhat long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
Writings in autumn continue on Friday, when there is a second domestic or Finnish test.
In the classes, the test is organized normally, i.e. the expression of the mind of the payees does not affect it.
The Student Qualification Board urges the testers to find the appropriate transport links in time so that they can get to the test event.
There may also be additional time if it can be shown that the delay was not due to your own negligence.
In Oulu, a trade in arms was robbed, threatening
In Oulu, a shop in the district of Kello was robbed on Wednesday morning.
According to police, the robber was dressed in dark clothes and covered his face in a commando gown.
The man is a normal guard and about 30 years old.
According to police, the man had threatened the personnel with a handgun and received a small amount of money for the capture.
It's being investigated as a felony.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support parties from other parts of Finland
A statement against the government’s decision to cut cuts will be blocked by the Helsinki City Centre on Friday, police say.
According to preliminary data, up to tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of SAK, Akava and STTK will meet at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the mental statement.
The task of the police at work is, in turn, not only to take care of alerting tasks and other police activities, but also to protect the flow of the giant spirit.
The roads leading to the railway station will be closed from motor vehicles for approximately 9:30-14 hours.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
In the direction of Hakaniem, traffic will be cut off from Kaisaniem’s traffic lane, from the west direction to Mannerheiminti.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Station, High Commissioner Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least it seems enough.
I'm not taking a stand on the police's work-related issues.
According to Kujala, support parties from other parts of Finland are coming to Helsinki due to a declaration of conscience.
The police don't tell you the exact party numbers.
“Something is coming, but as a rule, we can do it on our own,” Kujala says.
Police are urging private vehicles to be avoided in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic jam extends from the level of Hakaniemi to the core.
Stable traffic is expected from morning until early in the morning.
With representatives from other countries coming from Finland, there will also be a lot of order buses coming to Helsinki.
They will not be allowed to the railway station.
Buses are usually a long way off.
Then the rest of the trip has to go to a place of meditation,” Kujala says.
The Declaration of Mind also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, this is the positive side.
The issue of the smoothness of mass transport, which is normally at hand in these large gatherings of people, is now partly dealt with on its own.
The organisers of the statement have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government’s economic policy may come to Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the statement to run calmly.
The people are ordinary people who are employed or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, Finnish people are sensible and peaceful people,” Kujala says.
Local demonstrations will also be held in different parts of Finland on Friday.
Friday's expression of mind is, in many ways, exceptional - do you remember these lacata and expressions of mind?
In many ways, the great expression of interest organized by trade unions on Friday is interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is no very good comparison of Finnish political history, says Martti Siisi<0xC3><0xA4>inen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyv<0xC3><0xA4>skyl<0xC3><0xA4>.
It is no wonder that the Ay movement is protesting.
If it did not, it would raise its hands up in front of the government, says Siis<0xC3><0xA4>inen.
A very right-wing government has struck at the core of the tradition of Finnish corporatism - and also at those points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The Government’s hard work is lacking in contract law.
Here are a lot of features that the ay movement is really trying to get to its knees.
At the same time, the ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the Ay movement does not have the support of all payees for Friday expressions of their mind.
The new is now the sharp division that is generated by the expression of the mind among those whose ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed from different parts of Finland showed their minds at the House of Representatives in November 1993.
If Friday’s mood is looking for a place to compare, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, organized in 1993 by Murrostortai, Siisin<0xC3><0xA4>inen says.
In the middle of the deepest valley, Murrostorti gathered a total of 20,000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon’s (central) government is collapsing from the labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the relations between the Finnish government and wage-earners had never been as bad as during Aho’s bourgeois rule.
Now the relationship between the government and the Ay movement is perhaps even worse than in the days of Murrostorsta.
In addition, there is now the most bourgeois government in Finland ever, Siisi<0xC3><0xA4>inen says.
The current coalition of governments is still interesting in such a way that it is so strict right-wing despite the speeches of the Finnish fundamentalists.
At the time of the massacre there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousand delegates are expected to attend on Friday.
The declaration also stops public transport and potentially closes day-to-day homes and schools.
Although the expression of the mind receives the undivided support of the wage earners, it can become the greatest for years.
In recent years, there have been around 300 demonstrations in Helsinki every year.
They're loaded.
Traditionally, the demonstrations of the Finnish Ay movement have been quite peaceful – even though the ways of action have become more difficult in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, we are law-abiding.
Protesters are trying to avoid damaging or destroying the property, says Siis<0xC3><0xA4>inen.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of meditation has changed.
The EU member states urged farmers to throw eggs and the police were prepared to get pork on top.
The firemen's strike lasted for three months in 1998.
There were, among other things, visible patches on the pilots and flight managers.
Do you remember these people and the demonstrations?
Metal and electrical boxes of the 1970s
The most significant leaks of the 1970s were the metal leaks in 1971 and the power and electricity leaks in 1977.
70,000 metal members took part in the slaughter.
The strike was suspended by the Conciliation Committee on a proposal for a seven-week strike.
Metalworkers received a 16% pay raise.
In the spring of 1977, the electric shock lasted 49 days and caused power outages across the country.
Murrostorstai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, around 20,000 people gathered at the front of the House of Representatives, many of whom were unemployed, to express their opinion on the matter.
Firefighters laid off for three months in 1998
The firemen's strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999
In 1994, police officers protested against the EU in an egg-laying protest against farmers.
“Siberia teaches, the EU stops,” one of the slogans read.
In Spain, farmers poured tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also allowed farmers to protest and burn the July stakes in front of the meeting place.
Nurses were abolished in 1983 and 1995.
The nurses were discharged for about a month in 1995.
The last time they had been in the lake was in 1983.
A number of deaths occurred during the 1995 slaughterhouse.
Tehy threatened with a laco and the mass deportations of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass redundancies eventually accelerated the negotiations to a conclusion.
The doctors broke up in 2001
"Doctors in the lake - forced", was included in the 2001 medical check-up of the lactating doctors.
The slaughter of municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted for five months and sparked a lively debate on how the slaughterhouses could endanger patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5,000 students attended the march for their studies in Helsinki from the Senate to the House of Representatives in 2013.
The Central Criminal Police investigates the background of a Finnish gang filled with refugees to the Austrian police
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in finding out the background of the refugee gang registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a train in Aisterheim near the German border, carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known if the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Everyone on the bike was in good condition.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility is at the scene in Austria, says Tero Haapala, the Central Criminal Police Superintendent.
At the end of August, other refugees in Austria were more likely to be killed by a truck.
At the time, all 71 passengers on board were apparently killed by a suffocation.
According to the first report of cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
Among other things, the company operates a restaurant and its CEO is a foreigner, about 40-year-old man.
Two Iraqis have been arrested in Austria for human smuggling.
A refugee-savvy captain, a former drug courier, and an opulent businessman - the story of five smugglers
An up-and-coming king of smugglers, a violent shipwreck, a stylish missionary, and a taxi driver who thinks he's a good man.
For example, such people are engaged in human smuggling into the European Union.
Andrea Di Nicola, a criminologist at the University of Trento and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book The Office of Death appears in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present human smuggling chains, present solutions and present smugglers from different portals of the business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll get rid of them right away.
The islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for the summer retreat.
For its location, the islands are also great for smuggling, as the route to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 kilometers.
For comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives Emir, a burning captain in the chain and the father of six children.
The islands of Kerkenna are famous for their fracturing, but the fisherman is more profitable to transport people.
Emir has already done so hundreds of times on his blue, ten-metre wooden boat.
If the boat is full, it can accommodate 40 people.
From one trip, Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses.
Emir has five assistants who are looking for him clients from all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until it was again torn apart by the refugee crisis.
Guests arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
The food is provided so that the customers just and just stay alive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros per night, and if the customer leaves the money between them, it is their problem.
We leave for the water at midnight for a short time.
The first night is driven out of the islands, then stopped, waited for the day and driven the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes sailing is hard, and in waves 20 meters high, passengers cry and jump.
At the end of the day, the human cargo has been wrecked in half an hour and the Emir is leaving for the return route.
Emir wants us to be afraid of him.
That's why he's stalking his customers, and at least claiming that the sound engineers are dead.
He says in the book that when the police once stabbed him, he threw all his passengers across the deck and ordered them to swim to the nearest island.
“I singled out customers from the neck and threw them across the width,” Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of the Sahara.
He must have heard from his countrymen about this.
I'll get you out of them right away.
We need to show them right away who's in charge here.
Just an ordinary taxi driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogova<0xC3><0xB0>a, Serbia.
His taxi is not very good - the starter engine is racing at its last and, by the way, it has seen the best of its days.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi moves at all, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Bogova<0xC3><0xB0>a is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers south of Belgrade.
Next to the village there is a centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests around the city, men without their families are housed in tents, flats and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
There are also families living in the forest who, for one reason or another, have not applied for asylum in Serbia.
Some also live in private apartments, but it is a public secret.
Among the foresters, Goran finds most of its customers.
These are often end-to-end skirmishes - Through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of crossings and week-long walks on hard-to-reach terrain, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
When finally arriving in the Bogovad<0xC3><0xA4> area, at the junction of a large human smuggling, people are dying.
Goran's supporters are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
“They say their thing once and that’s enough,” Goran urges.
According to him, the Africans are trying to hide.
Goran doesn't like that.
Give us the food we need for each day.
First, the price is agreed on, for example, 300 euros, then they lower it to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I’m just doing my job and helping people,” he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than the others and charges only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 per person on the Hungarian border.
The distance is three hundred kilometers, most of the comfortable motorway.
I would like to ask you three or four times the price.
Goran earns about $50,000 a year.
It's not a big sum for the smuggler, but in Serbia it's a pretty nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not be allowed to transport migrants 12 kilometers closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn’t care: he knows the roads and paths and takes his rider to the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and shouts out.
Laupuda's work
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a Missionary Preacher, and that’s not just his favorite name.
He really does have a Protestant church in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, where many religious refugees from the Congo are visiting, as well as a small centre where Congolese children are being helped.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary is running a secret transportation business, where people are transferred from the Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing a decent job.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the white calfskin comb curls elegantly under the low waist of the jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his SUV and his three motorcycles.
When a missionary does not preach, he organizes people from the Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer first calls one of the five telephone numbers of the Mission Preacher.
He advises that it is worth arriving at the border in the morning, concealing the money wisely, and slapping the border amongst merchants.
In order to obtain asylum-seeker or refugee status, the Ugandan authorities must be informed that they are from, for example, the war zones of North Kivu, and that they have had to escape violence from their homes.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the Missionary organizes a new identity for the customer.
An old identity card will be destroyed and a second one will be purchased.
It helps the Ambassador's contacts with the Ugandan police.
After that, the client is directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: the asylum procedure, to civil society organisations, finally to the UN refugee agency UNHCR.
The missionary feels bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He calculates from each stage separately: the application to the Ugandan police costs about one hundred euros, the handling of documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150 and the migration process, for example, to some European country of 4 500-7000 euros.

Tom is a start-up smuggler, a former drug dealer.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on their way to Britain.
With his help, he has an Afghan, French taxi driver living in London, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know he is in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver pick up their client, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near the center of Calais.
They're driving the A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that. He's been on drugs for seven years.
When the taxi stops, Tom and his customers run over the motorways to the resting place where the scoundrels sleep before continuing across the canal to the British.
Tom chooses the right tyre - to make sure it's on its way to England, not the Netherlands - and cut across the safety barrier.
It has to be quiet so you don't wake up.
Sometimes there's a party involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customer in an aluminium foil, similar to the one wrapped around a frying pan or oven.
It should prevent a police heat scanner from detecting a concealer.
Some people use ice-filled sleeping bags for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place hoping that no one will rush the smugglers at least before Britain.
The King of Secret Riders
Muammer K<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xBC>k is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
The newly-rich Turk has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal Mediterranean pricing, who rules sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
K<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xBC>k has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new methods of transport.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he is only demanding money.
One of the new methods is luxury fishing: Turkish ports are rented for recreational boats to take US or European families on a few days’ tourist tours to suit them.
In reality, the ships are loaded to the full with Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported from Istanbul to a port and from there to the sea to Europe for a fee of EUR 5,000-7,000.
Customers are stored in human warehouses, for example in old industrial buildings, until it is time for them to leave.
People are stuck in minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, the ship must rise quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden under the cover for the entire journey.
The Navy can only observe how deep the ship swims, as other signs of the human crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers exhale and vomit, the better.
The little one gets about 53,000 euros from one luxury trip after spending.
He does not handle practical matters on his own, but hires captains, colorists, guards, hosts, and other smaller actors to handle the work on his behalf.
During the summer, there are at least hundreds of transports and K<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xBC>k earns millions.
He is believed to have purchased covert companies through land, a pharmaceutical company and over a hundred apartments that he rents.
Muammer K<0xC3><0xBC><0xC3><0xA7><0xC3><0xBC>k was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the field of medicine.
Since then, he has apparently disappeared.

An American Olympic runner tells in his book about his illness and how he started to become a prostitute
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1,500-metre runner who has competed in the Olympics three times, has attracted attention in the United States.
In her book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about ending her career and being a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the races in the top standings and ran for the second innings at the best time.
However, in the final, he panicked.
He rushed to the top right at the start and defended his place of leadership by a mountain run.
However, 150 meters before the goal, his strength came to an end.
He fell to the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him after each other.
I felt like an idiot and thought I'd never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton was suffering from a bipolar disorder.
His brother, Dan, had committed suicide a year before the Sydney riots, and he himself felt enormous pressures of success.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was intrigued by the idea of having money for sex with strangers.
She also told her husband to accept her actions.
Favor Hamilton's fee was 450 euros per hour.
He says he spent his money on luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton’s explanations for becoming a prostitute was that he needed the same adrenaline rushes as he had in his competition in general sports.
Later, Favor found out to Hamilton that he had a bipolar disorder.
The double life of an ex-star racer was revealed at the end of 2012, when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was at the 1500 metres world record time of 3.57.40, but remained in the final of the Sydney Olympics.
The world champion was delighted when the league put the Norwegian ski boot on the line: "Straight-forward"
Norway’s ski king Petter Northug has crossed the line of eligibility in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been swirling all summer and fall as they did last year from the athlete’s contract.
While the league has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has also failed to qualify for a multiple world champion and Olympic winner.
As a result of the contract dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to close Northug out of the next season's World Cup.
The decision was made thanks to the two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the league put a ski boot on the track.
“Thank you for showing your spine,” Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
“We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the Alliance’s sponsor,” he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Northug would obviously like to be part of the national team for the season so that he can advertise his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent the alliance, which also cares for future generations, and does not give one athlete a solo.
At the same time, he recalled that the League has granted Northug both economic and other special rights for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he is the best.
Northug released a statement on Tuesday in which he said he would like to play sports in the colours of Norway next season in the World Cup as well as then in the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cups in his career, two of which were gold.
He was part of a team that won the post gold in Falun last winter.
Easter Day is also celebrated in the Nordic countries.
On the 25th of September, the parades will be held in different restaurants and shops, which have been awarded the shield of Easter translators.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high-level expertise in the food sector and lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it should be recalled that not all high-end restaurants are concentrated in the metropolitan area, but top-rated and unbiased restaurants can be found all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of the increase in the visibility of the shelter restaurants and the organization.
In the Nordic countries, the day is organized in Vaasa, a restaurant in Fondis and Kantarellis.
In Kokkola, a restaurant in Old Town participates in the turtle day.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has been decided to make the organization one of the most important international events, which will be held during the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: Kauhava Reception Centre was established for the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre for the premises currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region still has a permanent critical infrastructure during the crisis, which is in the use of the Defence Forces and its partner, Suomen Erillisverkot Oy.
According to the Kauhajoki newspaper, the placement of the reception centre in the same building complex would constitute a significant security risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests related to the area and airport of the former Air Force School, the impact of which has not been ascertained in the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The case states that negotiations have been held over the last two years on the organisation of air training and the outcome of any foreign operator at the airport.
The issue has been discussed, inter alia, with Defence Minister Jussi Niinist<0xC3><0xB6> (ps.) and Defence Ministry Chief of Staff Arto R<0xC3><0xA4>dy.
The private person shall inform the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a question of the principle of opposition to the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned place in the former reserve area is wrong.
The far-flung city government addressed the reception centre issue last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
Administration means that the immigrants and those here have the necessary conditions, Niinist<0xC3><0xB6> commented to the reporters on the occasion of the adoption of the presidents of all the parliamentary parties at his official residence in M<0xC3><0xA4>ntyniemi.
According to the President, the concern over the management of the refugee situation brought all the participants together.
He considers it valuable that in Finland the ruling parties and the opposition parties are able to discuss confidentially the most pressing issues.
Especially in these times when we have big challenges ahead of us.
According to the report, the situation in Syria, as well as Russia and the United States in the region, could also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
There is a great hope for the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are capable, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and will continue to be tense on the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to Niinist<0xC3><0xB6>, the NATO issue was also sidelined in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.
Finnair cancels 16 domestic flights on Friday, Starts a couple of hours
One flight will be cancelled on Thursdays and 15 Fridays.
A list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair’s website.
Finavia reports that the operations of airports are aimed at managing the main forces during the occupation.
However, scrapes and delays are expected for security checks and other service points.
Enlightenment closes the streets of Helsinki city centre
Friday’s rally will close the streets of Helsinki’s city centre.
Police say the streets leading to the Railway Station will be closed from around 9:30 to 14.
Cars are not allowed in the direction of the Mannerheiminns Kaivokatu, Postikatua and T<0xC3><0xB6><0xC3><0xB6>l<0xC3><0xB6>nlahdenkatu in the direction of the railway station.
Traffic in the direction of Hakaniem is routed to Unionkadu by the traffic lane of Kaisaniem.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the number of people participating in the protest.
Only alert vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and ratchet biscuits all Friday in mind statement
Metro and tram drivers will take part in a mental demonstration on Friday from the beginning of morning traffic to the end of night traffic.
In the evening, the association of railway and metro staff told STT about this.
Most of the starts will be closed for two hours, including posts closed
Friday’s announcement also causes disruptions to Post’s services.
Significant delays are expected, among other things, for the distribution of daily mail.
Most of the post offices are closed.
Blood shipments of the Finnish Red Cross are handled despite the slaughter.
Food shipments, as well as hospital shipments and laboratory samples are also sought to be handled.
Situational information about the services can be obtained from the Posti website.
Most of Finland’s Alko will close its doors for two hours on Friday.
The trade union of service sectors, Pam, has instructed its employees to suspend work between 11 a.m. and 13 p.m.
Pam has also urged the employees of the day-to-day grocery store to participate in the expressions of professional organisations.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Sanom in Helsinki that the shops are trying to keep the main force open if necessary.
According to Kesko, there is no information on the possible closure of individual stores.
Helsinki’s day-to-day homes partially closed
Helsinki’s day-care centres are not fully operational on Friday, the Helsinki Early Childhood Education Agency said.
Due to the opinion of professional organisations, day care may be focused on certain day care homes, and there is no organization of day care centres and playgrounds.
The day-to-day day care centres, as well as groups of children with developmental disabilities and children with disabilities, remain open.
In addition, the afternoon activities of disabled and autistic schoolchildren are organised normally.
The early childhood education agency promises to inform more about the changes in activities tomorrow.
Media researcher: The onion takes a big risk
According to Sipil<0xC3><0xA4>, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister’s television and radio calls are one channel among others.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> told reporters in parliament.
S<0xC3><0xAD>pil<0xC3><0xA4> did not yet want to assess how often the repeated method of the Prime Minister's television and radio calls will become.
According to Sipil<0xC3><0xA4>, speeches may not always be communicated in the future on the Yle channel.
If other channels sign up as a channel, then let’s look at it.
"We're going to use this channel tonight," said Sipil<0xC3><0xA4>.
According to Sipil<0xC3><0xA4>, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires citizens to have a television and radio talk.
This whole thing, which we are talking about now, is quite complex and requires further justification.
That's why we ended up on this channel, Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> explained.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finland.
You can also watch it at the Yle Arena.
Snails take a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipil<0xC3><0xA4>’s televised speech will not tell you more about the government’s in-turn.
Is it an attempt to take the definition of public debate more closely into their own hands and to refuse to issue public debate resolutions? thinks Anu Koivunen, a professor at the University of Stockholm.
It is recalled that Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin recently commented that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define itself.
In the name of democratic debate and public opinion, I hope that these things are not related to each other.
Koivunen understands that the commercial media has been annoyed by the announcement of Sipil<0xC3><0xA4>.
It would be strange if the media did not react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not announcements in democracy.
The task of the media representatives is to ensure that the agendas of the politicians are not taken as given.
According to Koivusen, television talk is a big risk for Sipil<0xC3><0xA4>.
When speaking, the onion should bring something new and special to the table so that the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech are met.
Is there anything more we have heard today?
Or can he speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if there are only more of the same old in the permit, you have to wonder why such a big gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
Generally take a risk in this sense, if this is not a particular situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will become a message to politicians or to the parliament and the government, which is certainly not in Yle’s interests or the general line.
Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> ovela bet
What the Prime Minister is not saying is also important in the forthcoming speech by the media researcher.
In the evening, it is necessary to look closely at what Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> is missing and where it is not,” says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at the University of Jyv<0xC3><0xA4>skyl<0xC3><0xA4>.
According to Kuut, the TV talk is a bet from Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> ovela, because in this way this is able to bring out its own view without sound waves.
This way, the message gets a large audience without a journalistic filter, unlike in a press conference, where journalists can ask critical questions.
The monkey passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
The danger, however, is that the media misinterprets something about the speech, because there are no specific questions to be asked.
According to Kuut, it is very important how Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> appears on TV - whether it's sweaty, whether it's shaking hands.
He compares Sipil to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> is able to present his case well, it can work.
The situation is different than it would be if the government were to report something, because here a person is like talking directly to another person.
Such (U.S. President Barack) Obama and his partners engage regularly.
Really exceptional list.
Political scientist Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister’s speech to citizens to be truly exceptional.
He said it has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
“Exceptional time requires exceptional means,” Railo says.
The researcher believes that the prime minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the restrictions that are in front of him.
On Friday, the wage-earners organise demonstrations and strikes against the government’s actions.
The president of the Left Party, Paavo Arhinm<0xC3><0xA4>ki, says on Twitter that Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> could hold his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
SDP President Antti Rinne (sd.) once again announces his challenge to the Cyprus dialogue.
There is no time for monologues.
Almost six months after the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
9-year-old boy found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time of the discovery.
When the boy’s father updated his Facebook page, the boy’s father said: “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.
The Finnish Police Department also confirms the matter for the evening.
The boy went out to play at four o’clock in the afternoon.
Later in the evening, he was no longer contacted.
Father thanks all the people who helped in the search.
Thank you for these ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was shared nearly 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
Finnish UFC star disappoints in violent wilding of young people: You will create hatred
Kurdish-backed free fighter Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook, in which he specifically appeals to young immigrants.
Makwan Amirkhani had a heavy speech against the street fighting of young people.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and came to Finland with his family at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional competitions in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking him to view an Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account where young people are fighting in the most violent ways.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed in the young people's wildness.
Amirkhan, 26, has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The giants kick the earthlings, sit on top of each other, and suddenly strike without thinking about any of these consequences, what happens when you make such videos, Amirkhani updates.
Hard to defend anymore.
Some of the young people shown in the videos are immigrants.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, videos of fighting on social media have been uploaded by both immigrants and Finnish youth.
It's just that you're fighting your boss on the street.
You are making the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, the Turkic Amirkhani recalls.
Amirkhani points out that there are websites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite severe.
It's a little hard, boys, to defend you again.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and will be visiting here for a long time.
That's a slightly different way of thanking you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhan asks young people to remember their loved ones.
If they sometimes become the target of some kind of racism, then you may blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go on a date like that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action contributes to racism.
You're going to have to make me hate something I don't like myself.
By the way, you've got things pretty bad and you're not going to fix them at all, Amirkhani decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
SAK President Lauri Lyly said on Twitter that the wage-earners’ organisation is considering its position on Monday to present its alternative savings list.
Lauri Lyly commented on STTK’s proposal on Twitter.
Earlier on Wednesday, the HRC STTK informed the government that it had submitted its own proposal to achieve the five per cent productivity gap demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> (centre).
Akava President Sture Fj<0xC3><0xA4>der believes that the Government will accept the proposal if the SAK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest wage-earner organisation SAK to soften its previous position.
The president of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, made a bold comment on the matter on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss the matter on Monday.
According to Lylyn, the SAK is looking for solutions to "open up the labour market lock" and that instead of compulsory loans, agreements made by active parties are needed.
Lyly recalls that Prime Minister Sipil<0xC3><0xA4>’s proposal for a social agreement did not suit the SAK.
Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> had previously cut off negotiations on the social contract when the SAK refused to commit to the five per cent productivity target.
Comments on: The Big Bang Threatens to Blow - "It Feels A Little Funny to Tree a Box"
It feels a little funny to have a box if there is already a matching paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The sentiments vary in the wage-earners' camp from one layer to another.
Is the government going to scream in the air or is it going to agree with it?
On Monday, the Allies of the SAK took a sacred break from the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened with arrest.
The threat also spread to the Acadians.
The Association of Teachers (OAJ) threatened to close schools and day homes.
On Tuesday, the OAJ cancelled: no school or day care home is completely closed.
On Wednesday, the Chairman of the STTK, Mr Antti Palola (sd), made a conciliatory appearance.
He said he had kept in touch with the government and that Prime Minister Juha Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> (centre) demanded an alternative proposal for a five per cent productivity rate.
Akava President Sture Fj<0xC3><0xA4>der (kok) rushed to announce that his matching paper is already ready.
At first, the SAK office was not part of the hurry.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is hard to agree on when the Allies ordered the country to stand on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK’s Bureau will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that SAK is looking for solutions to “open the labour market lock”.
In order for a joint proposal by the payees to emerge, the SAK should tend to adopt a five-percent productivity log as a target.
It is no wonder that the STTK of Palola has good relations with the Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> government.
Jukka Ihanus, head of social interaction at the STTK, previously served as special assistant to the central prime ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kivinieme.
The fire was characterized by the fact that the government’s ay skills have improved all the time.
Rain or not, but Palola's exit took a bit of a purge away from the Finnish rebels, whose bellicose image is echoed by Akt Marko Piirainen (sd).
It feels a little funny to put a box in your pocket if you already have a matching paper.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lily's comments.
Russia accuses Finland of being a bad host: “This must not happen again”
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticized the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
According to Sergei Naryshkin, the President of the Russian Duma, Mongolia is a better Etyj host than Finland.
In the Mongolian capital, Ula Bator, a session of the OSCE Parliamentary General Assembly has begun, in which Naryshki made extensive comments on the July Helsinki Conference.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were on the European Union's list of sanctions - something that the President was able to remind reporters of.
In our opinion, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This should not be repeated, Naryshkin stressed the news agency according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin’s criticism was directed at the United States, where his access was also blocked.
Sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin said.
The Russian delegation to Mongolia got into trouble, so Naryshki continued to spy on Finland by encouraging and thanking Mongolia for "excellent organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary General Assembly will run constructively and with the most positive results - unlike the one held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there are no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (kok), who, according to Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation in Ula Bator.
Close encounters a real playoff pick: "Paints in a tight"
Killer and Lock continue the bull days in Hakamets today, when both are on fire on the second day of recovery.
Janne Lahti predicted that today in Hakamets there will be no actual paint festivals.
Yesterday, the killer was in Kuopio digging a 3-2 pass from KalPasta.
The rise was male, as last season's silver team was at its worst from a two-goal loss.
Tuesday was a lot more win-win.
The guest of Blues, who started the Romanians in a tactile way, was a round of zero points, and the losses were 2-3.
Hard game, goals in tight, if at all they play the same game as last year, Lock-in striker Janne Lahti predicted the settings on the sides of the team.
A rather playoff nightmare has been formed for the Romanians.
In fact, in the last two seasons, Tappara has stepped into the middle of the final series of Luke.
In both cases, the solution is required to solve the seventh match.
Last season, Lock took the series to the break already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose to the next three and finished.
There are no major changes in the composition of the groups, except for the means of painting.
Both of the cashiers who fought yesterday are getting a hoax today.
Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Point of View: In the <0xC3><0x85>s, a sad play is going on
Sports Director Toivola wrote an inappropriate follow-up to the head coach Rautakallio, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the film Rocky, in which he played the lead role.
He made a sensational contribution to Apollo Creed, the world heavyweight champion of the series.
Rocky got a lot of sympathy, even though he eventually lost the title fight.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola wrote an unrelenting ash story for Pori.
The nameless and woody bat pack went on to surprise everyone at the 2006 World Cup finals.
The team was full of unnamed but tough underdogs like Rocky.
There was White India, Pori Mattia and Pele Pelto.
In the fall games, players dyed their heads red and cut the rainbows.
The girl was a blonde.
Major TV reporter JP Jalo called the coach Neumann.
You took the winning silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The writer Toivola believes that this season’s novel works work in the same way as they did ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports director for <0xC3><0x84>ssie has built a Passover in the place of the evil boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have dug up the remains in the dungeon like Rocky's pig carcasses at a slaughterhouse.
The achievements of Masi Marjam<0xC3><0xA4>ki, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparinen are somewhere other than circular playing.
Hope has forgotten that the main character in Rocky VI is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has been named Sean Connery of the Iron Cross.
Rautakallio is a play written by Toivola in Rocky as much as Connery would have been in the original 1976 play.
There's nothing in the Iron Rock but my favorite name.
The game philosophy of the Iron Ball does not include wrestling and small-scale hunting.
He appreciates the hard game, but it's a different thing to play hard than a pig.
Last season, <0xC3><0x85>ssien Garret Stafford tackled Tappar Jere Karjala.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Iron Skull put the man in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play for those who deserve it.
I do not accept such a game and it does not belong to the village, the hot visited Iron Hill woke up after the game to the nation of Satakunta.
The team of the Eagles this season is strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, police and escorts.
In practice, there are no key players in the best age of the game.
It's no wonder the head coach has complained about the skill set.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of last season affect procurement and unfortunately the situation in the market was a little blurry, Rautakallio replied diplomatically.
Under the surface of the city.
The 1953 model Rautakallio is, of course, interested in moving to Toivola as a sports car.
Men's contracts end in spring.
The balance of the <0xC3><0x84>ss in the three leagues of the season has the same number of losses with a score of 1-6.
I do not think it would have been better to write a sequel.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santapuki's mother
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka in his teens, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yes, in the movie, I play my husband's friend's mother.
In a way it feels crazy, actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He has been married to Apulanta’s ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temosen since 2008.
The couple has done a lot of work together in the past, but now for the first time, Olga plays under Tuuka's direction.
Olgan’s role in the film You Made Us Beautiful is played by Sipe Santapuki’s mother Sirkka.
Sirkka walks in and supports his son, although this father Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann) tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I’ve become familiar with my real role model in Sirkka, the easier it feels to play the role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting the role for me.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have come a long way.
They've met, talked on the phone, and communicated.
Sirka has helped a lot.
We've gone through a lot of different angles in their history.
Sirkka also fortunately understands that drama is drama and the truth may have to be colored a little.
Olga points out that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulanda would become Finland’s biggest band.
In the 90's, there was mud and real anguish.
There was a fairly low probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some intuition, and she was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot about Tuuk from this youth before the film plans.
However, the stories of the parents have sometimes been a little different.
Yes, if you’re a 15-year-old teenager, then how many parents actually know what you’re doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that of Tuuka, known as Heinola’s notorious skateboarder.
Olga was an archer and kind girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
At the very least, he could have been secretly fascinated.
Olgan says he has worked with Tuuka so much over the past 10 years that he is not afraid of a big joint project.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the entire production team goes to Heinola for a month for the descriptions.
However, the couple living in Iitt will often drive home at night because of their small children, as the distance is not too long.
We're taking the whole Heinola for a month.
They have taken us really warm, just asking what streets and when they will be cleared.
Iron Sky 2 is the most expensive feature film in Finland.
Timo Vuorensola’s budget for Iron Sky: The Coming Race is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17 million.
Descriptions will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola will begin filming Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
The sequel to Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will become the most expensive feature film of all time in Finland with a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17 million.
Previously, the title of Finland’s most expensive film was Jalmari Helander’s Big Game.
The upcoming Angry Birds animation will also go up after finishing Iron Sky 2, as the film’s budget is over 100 million euros.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaa, begins in October in Antwerp near the premises of AED Studios and lasts for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola will be leaving for Belgium next week.
The budget is not scary.
I've been sick for a while!
I have such a relaxed fiilis from the script because I know exactly what kind of book should come from.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that something unprecedented is being done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
While time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I’m more excited, and I can’t wait to show this leffe to the public,” he told Evening News.
Initially, the budget of the film was planned to be 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also grew.
It's a big budget, but it's a big stork.
However, 100 million should be involved in the film, because every angle and effect is so expensive.
Now everything has been turned so tightly that there is no hole.
The film's production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign and a crowdfunding loan on Wednesday to pay a 4-8 percent annual interest rate.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
Within two years at the latest, the company will repay the loan.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
A joint or a cool one?
Big logos come back to shirts
Trendsetters’ busts have recently been decorated with big logos.
Even some time ago, a fashion-conscious outfit avoided clear and large logos like Crocse’s consana.
Advertising of a hoodie or t-shirt was seen somewhat as a junt.
But times change.
Sportiness has become the true fashion megatrend, and so have the old, well-known sportswear brands like Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line of fun and trend is dazzling: if something is already right junta, it begins to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, i.e. tavis fashion, where trendsetters were surprised to favor as dull basic clothing as possible as a way to stand out from the crowd.
Now, instead of the grey base colleg, the net pockets buried at the bottom of the cabinet, in front of which the manufacturer’s logo is embellished.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas-recognised stripe nets, favorite team jerseys and New York Yankees flip-flops have also made a comeback.
Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail at the beginning of the jeans.
The trend seems to be shifting from sportswear brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the busting of Versace’s autumn blouses makes it clear what brand of clothing is involved.
Would you be willing to introduce the logos to your outfit?
The Russian politician published the proof: I didn’t get stuck in the tank for hours!
According to the allegations, a special incident would have taken place in Nizhni Tagil, which held the Russia Arms Expo 2015 presenting products of the Russian military industry.
In recent days, the Russian media have been spreading colorful claims that the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations had to remove large-scale Zotovia from the tank lock for five hours.
Zotov has since made every effort to dispute the data.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page, in which he appears to be squeezing the body of the armored vehicle in quite good mood, and at least not to be confused or angry with them.
It's full of shit.
Let’s start with the fact that I didn’t go into the armored combat vehicle, but it was the armored BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I've served at Urals.
I went in there, looked around me and came out in peace,” Zotov told Komosomolskaya Pravda.
“I didn’t get stuck and really didn’t spend five hours in that position,” he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian military TV channel his admiration for the new technology in the exhibition because he is himself a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons, I admired our technology.
And I came out through the back door, he said.
I went to every tank.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all tanks and all armored vehicles, Zotov promised.
Zotov also boasted about the stupidity of the journalist who wrote about it.
One fool wrote and all the others repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went in, and I came out.
“I’m long and grotesque, but nothing like being stuck somewhere in a tank didn’t happen,” he told Russian radio station sluzhba novostei.
Zotov’s words support the fact that no photo of the alleged jamming has been published, although a total of 50,000 people attended the exhibition in a few days.
The claim of Zotov’s attachment began with a story on the Bloknot.ru website, in which Zotov was told to his brakes as he tried to get out of the tank and threatened to eventually shoot everyone around him unless he could get out of the surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up event in which the organisers of the exhibition reported their views on the event.
Everyone is just used to the fact that soldiers quickly jump out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, because of his large size, was simply late when he came out.
But he didn’t sit there for five hours in any way, said the exhibition’s coordinator Aleksandr Pisarevsky Bloknot.

The mining company Agnico Eagle in Kittil<0xC3><0xA4>, Finland, has been inundated.
The purified process water of the gold mine has been drained from the so-called enrichment sand pool.
According to the company, measures have been taken to repair the leak.
Below is a neutralised enrichment sand and purified process water of the foaming process.
In general, water is either pumped for re-use as process water or diverted, as permitted, through the surface inspection field to the environment.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the drainage water meets the current permit conditions.
No other substance will hurt the environment.
The leak was detected during the inspection cycle on Monday morning.
No structural damage has been detected to the pool's structure.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Danske Kuopapam<0xC3><0xA4>ki: IMF warns of cutting too much
The report published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is largely in line with the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation has paid tribute to Finland’s comprehensive structural reforms in order to solve economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction in overtime and paydays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the entire contractual system and unemployment insurance.
According to Danske Bank’s chief economist Pasi Kuopapam<0xC3><0xA4>ki, we agree on structural reforms, but there are small differences.
The IMF estimates that there are a lot of messages accompanying the government’s actions, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be over-cut.
Such are, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuopapam<0xC3><0xA4>ki tells Taloussanomi.
In the IMF’s view, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts Finland’s economic growth of 0.4 per cent this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
Danske predicts that growth will remain at zero this year in its new economic forecast.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They could have been the basis for the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was on a small increase in summer, Kuopamp<0xC3><0xA4>ki says.
Less attention has been paid to the weakened confidence of industry or other so-called softer gauges.
However, the difference is only a few decimal points.
Nintendo, who is recovering from death, has appointed a new leader.
In July, Satoru Iwata, who had been working under cancer, began work on Wednesday, Nintendo said on Monday.
Iwata has led Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the successful launch of the Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of those names that was highlighted by Iwata as possible successors.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata’s footsteps, Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda told Reuters.
Kimishima’s mission is to bring Nintendo heavily into mobile games, but so that it doesn’t eat the company’s bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more underage asylum-seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency acknowledged that hundreds of children who have come to the country are missing every year.
SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, among others, have reported the disappearance of hundreds of underage applicants each year, according to the Swedish Immigration Service.
Juha Kannelmaa, Superintendent of the Finnish Immigration Agency, explains what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear "under the country" per year?- In Finland, a total of 156 asylum applications were made in 2013 alone.
Nine of them are missing.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, Kannelmaa says.
It may be that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has possibly been found to be full-time there in the course of the proceedings.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to lose than to continue processing the case in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will be found later when they apply for asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3,651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 were dismissed because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so the adult asylum seekers disappeared during the last 123 years, he says.
Is the number growing?
By 6.9 this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for minors.
There are no overall statistics on the number of underage asylum seekers missing this year, but the number of underage applicants is thus well known and has increased significantly, which is likely to also affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
What about those who have received the translation decision?
Does it also cover them, for example, in the “dark labour market”?
This is difficult to assess by the Immigration Office, since the implementation of the translation decisions is the responsibility of the police, Kannelmaa emphasises.
Minister of the Interior Petteri Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered seekers in the country.
He has taken action on the matter.
At the meeting of the EU’s Interior Ministry, Orpo, who discussed refugee issues, said on Monday that practical measures were being taken to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A's studio online - see photos of the devices
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s equipment for television and radio productions, a media researcher who lost his job due to illness, is now on sale.
Mikkosen’s wife Nina Mikkonen sells equipment at Huuto.net, which was once the most advanced equipment of professionals in her field.
The online publication was the first to report on the website of Iltamacasine.
Today, a large part of the equipment has remained at the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, TV shows for Betacam tapes are no longer depicted.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there are those who are interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date in this way, but these are also needed as long as there is such an old generation of material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many enthusiasts - collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thinks of IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos are trying to move away from their current home in Myrskyl<0xC3><0xA4>.
We can't take all the goods with us.
I've started inventing a small box and looking at where the goods are being delivered.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There is no longer any use for televisions and radios.
After a stroke, it is clear that a man who has made a long career will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen notes that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s real life work was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to pick up films and other material from Myrskyl<0xC3><0xA4> at the box office.
Traffic threatens to break through the wooded area after thinking worse: Metro and trams can stop for the whole Friday
Metro and tram drivers decide today whether to extend their powers in connection with Friday’s announcement.
The original plan was to stop the metro and tram traffic only during the demonstration of the mind on Friday.
During the afternoon, you decide if your traffic will stop for the whole day.
Trustee Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is great in the field.
Night- and day- and night-time cuts are bad for drivers, so the government’s plans to cut the extras are a source of resistance.
However, Hirvonen thinks that stopping traffic for the whole day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop on Fridays, public transport in the metropolitan area is practically completely stopped.
According to VR data, trains do not run on Fridays between morning and evening.
On Friday, there will be no close or long-distance traffic.
The trains leaving before the drought are driven to the terminals.
According to HSL, the majority of buses remain on the road.
Members of the AKT are out of work on Friday from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, they are driven by the main force, according to HSL’s Pirkko Repo.
Repo says that HSL can’t tell exactly which bus tours will take place on Friday.
The wage-earners will hold a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Station on Fridays from 11 am to 13 pm.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, the AP news agency said.
According to Sky News, the refugees have tried to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police also used water cannons against people.
A Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas - a teacher thought his watch was a bomb
In the United States, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after a teacher thought he had brought his own clock to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to present his electronics stunts on production.
However, one of the teachers thought the watch looked like a bomb.
The police were called to the scene, and the situation ended with the boy being taken to the juvenile detention centre in handcuffs.
Muhammad has never been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made a clock.
However, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making more lies.
According to Mohammed, the police had said that the clock looked like a “movie bomb”.
The watch is kept by the police, but it was obviously made up of a circuit board and a digital display, between which there were wires.
The incident took place last Monday and Mohamed was punished by three days of forced schooling.
His father is furious about the case and the country’s U.S.-Islamic Council is considering whether the case is yet another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain says Labour leader has refused to sing national anthems
In the song, God is asked to protect the queen, but Corbyn is opposed to the monarchy.
The right-wing press has also joined forces with representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, said Labour MP Kate Green, a public radio company in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday’s commemoration honored the British Air Force’s fight against the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In its official statement, the Workers' Party defends Corbyn and emphasises its respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude for the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully quiet during the national anthem, the statement was highlighted.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the lines of the Labour Party.
In particular, there are representatives of the people who are afraid of his evading moderate voters with their radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of unilateral disarmament, the cessation of austerity measures and the increase in public spending.
Mr Corbyn is due to appear as the party leader for the first time today in Parliament during the Prime Minister's interrogation.
Corbyn has asked the public for proposals on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron tweeted last week about Corbyn's election as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted on his own account.
The cause of the Minnesota family murder is still unclear - the father of the family was waiting for a court case
South Lake Minnetonka police have recently investigated the family's death in Greenwood, Minnesota.
The family of five was found dead in their home on September 10, and a few days later police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father Brian Scott Short, 45.
The first time he shot his wife and three children, Brian Short, he killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for a few days
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
According to this announcement, the police went to the house for an inspection visit and found a huge house from all over the world as Short's family died.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
A Million House and a Successful Company
South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Sitari's case is still under investigation.
The cause of blood clots is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his fortune for nurses on the social media site AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 StarTribune interview, Short reported that there are four million different visitors per week on the site.
I have made 50 purchase offers from the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned them all.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, in the fact that Short’s family bought a haunted house in 2011 from Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised on a real estate site in Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also a garage for eight cars.
Court case in progress
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was waiting for a court case.
Achieve Test Prep, who offers various prep courses, had challenged her to court for commenting on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prepin, no comments were removed from Short’s site that were offensive to the prep courses, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the court proceedings would have had a very significant impact on Short’s business.
Vesku Loiri offered cake coffee
In addition, the owner’s trio were awarded with the Finnish Hippos Horse Owner of the Month Award at the treatment event.
This is great, Loiri commented on his charity tribute.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000 in winnings.
The artist legend Loiri was still puzzled by the success of Fabrice Duo in the big competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the coach of the success horse Korpi gets full peace of mind working with the horse.
Pekka orders and decides where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I'm holding my ass, Loiri snapped.
"The Greatest Donation of All-Time Athletes" from the NHL Star
Montreal Canadiens superstar P.K. Subban has donated $10 million ($6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the hospital, this is a single donation made by the greatest athlete of all time to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital in the other fundraiser for the next seven years.
Subban signed a deal with the Canadiens eight years ago, worth $72 million.
Subban's donation amount is therefore significantly higher than his $9 million annual income.
As a reward, Subban receives a scholarship to be awarded to the hospital.
In the past, Canadian players have helped a great deal in local hospitals.
A year ago, longtime captain Jean Beliveau raised millions of dollars for the same children’s hospital, among other things, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum of money for another major hospital in the city to get a PET scanner needed for cancer research.
Japanese cafe can order a wife for the evening - serves food only bikinis and aces on top
Coffee is a big deal in Japan.
The markets already have a goat coffee shop, a canned coffee shop, a vampire coffee shop, a haiku coffee shop and now a wife coffee shop.
It strikes lonely, vigilant, and hungry.
It was reported by Metro.
Ore no Yome (my wife) coffee in Tokyo can be ordered by your wife or husband for dinner.
This is a waiter who pretends to be the customer’s spouse.
"Police" is selected from the list before coming to the cafe and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is against just the ass and the bikinis are on, and the husband is in tight cycling shorts.
The website provides female candidates with all the information about the length and weight of the mattress they prefer to sleep on.
150 million vehicles will soon be connected to the network: Attacks on vehicle information security tasks began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, according to a statement released by Intel.
The board is made up of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB’s researchers will conduct ongoing security tests and inspections with the aim of standardizing best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of the best practices for cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB’s research results.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consulting firm, estimates that by 2020, approximately 150 million vehicles in transport will be connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles will be able to consume, create and share network-based data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars,” said Chris Young, head of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish the best practices related to security and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of every network-connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS will cost around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>52,000 in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS model is expected to be up for years to come.
Finally, the car begins to be in sight in Finland as well.
Ford has revealed the details of the RS now that the auto worldviews are at the Frankfurt Auto Show.
Ford’s new four-cylinder RS accelerates its 2.3-litre, 350-horsepower engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to a hundred and has a top speed of 266 kilometers per hour.
The most interesting thing about Finland is the price, initially it is said to be 52,000 euros.
The car is now available to order, but when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not say in its announcement.
Kia presented two new products at the Frankfurt Motor Show - such as the new Sportage and Optima
More important than the two innovations in Finland is the new fourth generation Sportage, with which Kia intends to capture the larger side of the ever-growing roller coaster market.
The Sportage, which was created by the new European design director Gregory Guillaume, is more circular than ever before.
The wheelbase and exteriors have been here for a century and the car breaks the air even more efficiently.
The engine range is largely ahead of schedule, but it has been added to the 177 horsepower-developed 1.6-litre turbo.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance as well as consumption are explained in more detail about sales revenue.
We will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive in spring 2016.
Even before the exchange of the year, our country got new Kia Optimas.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn’t seem to have changed, but it’s a completely new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of higher middle class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher level of equipment.
Optimists equipped with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine will be launched.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when the Optima GT, equipped with a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine, arrives alongside them.
At the same time, with its arrival, the sale of Optima-farm begins.
Chisu returned to the stables - exploded in a bold harem
Singer Chisu will be present at the Life for a Child concert with other domestic stars.
In the electric pantsuit, there is a visible, open neck opening.
The house presents a beautiful singer-star siro waist.
The whole crown is a gold metal belt and a red lipstick.
During the three-year break, the singer, who became a mother, has been punished by light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be one year old.
The singer released her first single from her new album in August.
Going back to the boards and getting in front of a large audience after a long break doesn’t really bother me.
It’s been a long time since I’ve done everything about music,” the singer said.
Chisu will release his fourth album, Polaris, in a few weeks.
Your new life situation has inspired you to make new songs.
At this point, wondering if people will find my new record, Chisu thinks.
Kim Kardashian's style of motherhood amazes again - now you can see the chest
Tosi-TV beauty Kim Kardashian gives speeches one after another.
She introduces her pregnancy and breast-feeding naked in sexy clothes, last night at one of America's time, when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian with her husband Kanye West's cake.
The black maternity dress is transparent to the chest.
It reveals the skin-coloured bras under the dress when the flashlights shine.
Last time Kardashian dressed up in an Amazonian maternity home, he went to a friend’s dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The stage was highlighted by black over-the-top boots.
The third special maternity component is as recent as last week’s Friday, when there was a miscarriage in the presentation.
The Hard Laws of the Model World: No Home, You Are Lonely, Competition Is Horrible
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to get the idea that the world of fashion was pure glamour and champagne.
He made his own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and his colleagues talk about pure modeling.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts with nothing.
Even if in the previous season you had swam in the clothes of top designers, the new season starts with castings again.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces that compete with the competition.
The models rarely have a place, which they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can go on for a year, so that the accommodation is a hotel room or an apartment in which fashion houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother can’t travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
It's not just a one-size-fits-all.
An agent in New York may ask for a drop in pounds, but in Paris they say you're too skinny.
Getting a job is always a risk game.
During fashion weeks, models and designers are together all the time, and function as a support network at the same time.
When the fashion weeks are over, the difference is staggering.
The models want this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but they are filmed by the fact that everyone thinks the work is just a presentation of clothes.
The models also want to be their own person.
The work makes the models feel that they are actors who have a role.
But in the work of the model can also express itself.
Models yesterday at Tory Burch's show.
New York is currently spending fashion weeks, where designers will reveal their designs for next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, presents the most unknown Apulanta music in the film
Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautala, the founder of the band, in the film based on the early years of the band.
Lautala formed Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but divorced from the band in 1994.
This is a big challenge for me because I am a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this film I present a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I didn't want to see the real Ant before the descriptions, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly unknown to people about this group, so I think it’s great that I’m learning her playing style only from video.
I don't want to make an imitation of a human.
A man who believes in a band called Roope Salminen and Dogs is not a source.
Punk manners come naturally to man.
Stars, stars in the punk section of the program certainly many saw the premonition, even if you have ever visited our fairs.
Our appearance has never been anything short-lived, but we always go fully.
Tuukka Temosen, who played bass in Apulanna in 1993-2004, announced today the main actors of the film Teit om s<0xC3><0xA4>in beauin.
The band’s well-known core group is represented by young actors who are still quite unknown to the general public.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki performed by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Virta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temo Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint about his upcoming wash as early as last night, when he told Snapchat he was secretly preparing for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of his new look on Instagram, which he has had to make for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the wigs and leggings, has started his face as a silo, and dyed his brown hair as a black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to think about how to tell a child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
It does not have to be taken as a loudspeaker, as the psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises, a member of the SPR crisis group.
Younger children should be protected and, for example, should not be allowed to watch the news alone.
Little children don’t always understand what they see, and it can stay in their minds and become anxious, he says.
However, if the child has encountered television news stories about refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth taking a call.
It is a good idea to visit the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he or she is asking.
Your child’s fears may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones that the parent imagines him to be afraid of.
A child should not be afraid of nothing, even if he is anxious and afraid.
A younger child closely monitors the behavior of his or her parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will also feel safe.
Older children are likely to encounter refugees in school, with friends, or online for discussion.
It is good for parents to take the matter with them if the child is thinking about it.
The fact is that not all people in the world are well.
Parents, together with their children, can think about how this is handled in our family.
Is the world, after all, a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different educational perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as much as possible.
On the other hand: If the family also talks about difficult things, the child gets a model of how to deal with the challenges ahead in life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: “Teach your child to help the weaker”
Your powers at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child.
Vermoon's striking Ballroom is hard to control
Perttu Pohjola had the Apila Pallosalama skided to support the attack in the middle of the summer.
It only scratched wins and doubles until the end of July in the Tampere raves suffered a collapse.
Because the slave fell to the ground, the trainer suspected something was wrong and ordered his bodyguards to take the time to see a veterinarian.
The explanation for the shutdown was clear in the emphasis.
The horse had a throat infection.
The disease was not the mildest, but it took two cures to eradicate it.
As Apila’s Ballosalama had to be in light exercise, Pohjola says she is positively surprised by the horse’s last run.
It was in Turku at its time of recording, the second SE-tammer after the Tarunt<0xC3><0xBC>len wind.
Apila’s Pallosalama was under a lot of pressure at the time when it was only able to drive normally for a few weeks.
From the point of view of the small tendency at the end, it was understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that the good competition made the ori a field.
The flow of the horse certainly went ahead of it, and I hope it would also be balanced.
Apila's Pallosalama has been so-called humorous horses.
When it's not interested, it's been able to shed a tear without the disease.
On a good day, the eagles have, instead, separated from the eagles such an inscription that the opponents have been in wonder.
At a high speed, fellow competitors can’t get to the Ballosalama, from which even warm-blooded riders can get away.
There is a pesos race in Vermossa.
The difference, however, is how Apila Pallosalama agrees to it.
It is quite difficult at the time of departure and may even puke under the bonnet of the departure car and so on.
I hope the slave is calmer than when he leaves Turku.
Apila’s Ballosalama will be able to come from the club as well, and we will leave to drive for the win, the coach promises.
That's why you can't get rid of useless iPhone apps
Tim Cook, Apple's CEO.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple’s iPhone phones may be removed at some point in the future – but not all.
Apple may want to remove some of its own apps from iPhones in the future, Tim Cook, CEO of the company, told Buzzfeed in an interview.
Apple’s iPhone has a number of programs that are relatively rare to use: for example FaceTime calls, Journals, Health, Exchange, Podcasts, and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which became a mandatory update for iPhone phones, although it is only required for Apple Watch owners.
According to Cook, removing Apple’s software is more complicated than it looks.
Some apps are linked to some other iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook tells Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple’s iPhone apps work solidly with other programs.
There are other programs that don’t work that way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
According to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter, as the company does not want to waste memory from users’ iPhone phones.
Eurozone inflation fell to 0.1 per cent in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, i.e. 0.1% year-on-year, Eurostat said today.
The rise in prices led to a decline in energy.
In this way, Eurostat revised back a couple of weeks to a slightly lower estimate of 0.2 per cent.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called basic inflation fell in August to 0.9 per cent from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's forecast for the base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2% cheaper in the last month than a year ago.
The average inflation rate across the 28 EU countries was at zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
The highest consumer prices in the euro area, i.e. 1.4 per cent, rose in Malta in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was at its lowest rate at 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0,2 %, according to the EU harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area remains far from the European Central Bank (ECB) target, which is a two-percent rise in prices in the medium term.
The ECB forecasts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for the euro area this year.
Next year, the rise will be boosted to 1.1 per cent, with the central bank predicting its release in its new inflation forecasts at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is trying to tighten its monetary policy.
The next U.S. recession will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more likely within three years after the country’s central bank, the Fed, is once again taking a long time to raise interest rates.
And in the financial market, the downturn begins before the next recession.
The Fed has indicated that it is likely to start interest rates as early as this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
So the next downturn can push on at its fastest by next fall and as a course race in the financial market before that.
Or at least this is what happens if the world’s largest economy and financial markets work as they used to – and if they react to the tightening of Fed money as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been reached by Deutsche Bank’s strategies for market research in London, in its extensive research of long-term market and economic cycles by Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker.
The bank distributed over 60 pages of the Long-Term Asset Return Study research report to its international major clients last week.
The research and report’s strategies do not believe they know when exactly the Fed will start raising interest rates or what happens in the economy and market after that.
Instead, they present, through the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, how the economy and the market have behaved in the past during and after the Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they look at what the key variables in the economy and financial markets are now in the same or different pattern as they were in the previous installments - and what may be the result.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial market are now in a weaker position to withstand the rise in interest rates than once before in the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not last
The leaders who decide on the Fed’s monetary policy and its current mandate have hinted throughout the past summer and the beginning of the year that the time is beginning to be ripe for interest rates to rise.
The first increase to more than nine years can be reached already this week.
The matter will be resolved by Wednesday and Thursday when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed's Executive Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
Last time the Fed raised its so-called Fed funds controlling interest rate in June 2006.
At the same time, a series of relatively regular, but at the same time small, 0.25-percent interest rate hikes ended, with the Fed raising its interest rate from 1.25-percent to 5.25-percent.
The symptomatic financial market began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis broke out as the global nightmare of the doomsday.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, the serious setbacks in the financial markets and the real economy began slower than has typically been the case since the previous Fed's instalments.
Similarly, the experiments were harder and rougher than they were in the 1930s.
Deutsche’s strategies have traced the rise and fall of the world’s largest economies, as well as the reversals of the financial market since the 1950s and in places since the early 19th century.
Since the 1950s, they have been making an account of the Federal Reserve's interest rates and their economic and financial implications.
The fastest time since the start of the recession has been less than a year, usually less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The course growth in the financial market has ended within one to two years of the start of the Fed’s interest payments.
The Fed has increased and decreased its controlling interest rate since the early 1950s by a dozen distinct cycles.
Each time has diverged in some respects from others, and the times in the review are relatively niqalty, so based on them it is hardly possible to conclude anything certain about the effects of the following interest rates.
The strategies also remind us that this time a lot of things are different.
And not just better.
You're too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis were not necessarily to be found out without a doubt even through decades of research.
But the three factors that led to the crisis and increased its destructive power seem to be somewhat unquestionably clear:
1) The Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other largest central banks in the world considered their controlling interest rates too low in the 2000s.
They tracked down the traces of the tech bubble, and at the same time grew the following.
2) The debt accumulated in different parts of the financial and real economy over the decades, and still too large, has grown even larger as a result of the influence of the central banks' overrun monetary policy.
The biggest debt bubble in the history of the economy was born.
3) In particular, the insanely low debt financing, which is packed with the closest holdings of the financial economy, has exposed to most parts of the financial market the largest exchange rate piles in the history of the economy, from stocks to real estate, debt books and commodities.
Nor is it difficult to argue that the financial markets, which rose to higher levels in the wake of increasingly complex debt ceilings, were in an unusually dangerous and unstable position when the Fed and other central banks last raised interest rates.
The valuation bubbles recovered from the debt-backed financial structures only lasted after the start of the interest payments and the cost of debt financing had risen.
The risks were realized as a financial crisis, and this was followed by a large decline.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategies do not predict what will happen next, but give the issue of nuclear power by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now held their monetary policy to an even lighter degree than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low too long before the crisis, they have now been even lower for longer.
2) Borrowing has not long been as insane as it was ten years ago, but now debt is at its cheapest literally cheaper than free.
So the debt of the financial and real economy has not eased, but now in the various parts of the economy the debt burden is much heavier than before or after the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity, which has since become more volatile and cheaper than central banks, has largely remained on the financial market and has slowed down key securities and asset classes to the highest level, or at any time, before the financial crisis.
Nor are the strategies of the lattic climate only on the warning signs of the financial market, but they also note that not even the US economy has recovered from the financial crisis and the most severe recession in decades to the model that has happened before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is unusually weak, but similarly, the pressures and risks of the financial market are vastly higher than before the financial crisis, when the Fed next starts tightening its money tighter.
Perhaps the image of the future of the Societe Generale strategy by Albert Edwards is not as strange as it may seem.
For a long time, he has trained the Bank’s international investor clients in the following translations from the Fed:
First, the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles burst - and soon it's time for the Fed to shut down the financial bubbles with even bigger QE money injections.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), which manufactures computers and printers, plans to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are directed towards HP’s corporate service side, the company says.
In November, HP will be distributed to HP Inc., a company focused on enterprise sales, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and consumer-oriented PCs and printers.
HP’s workforce was at its highest in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff were reduced to 302000.
The company records a one-off cost of $2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) from the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce the number of employees between 25,000 and 30,000.
The consumer side will be reduced to 3,300 within three years.
HP plans to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be low-cost countries in 2018.
The company says it has already balanced its business in such a way that none of its customers are responsible for more than ten percent of its business results.
In the second year, its three most important customers accounted for 65 percent of the business result.
iOS 9: How to get a new operating system on your iPhone after Apple’s update
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app by clicking on "General" and then clicking on "Software Update".
If the update is ready, the phone gives the option to download and then install it.
Some have had problems after this installation, when the "Software Update Failed" error message has appeared on the screen.
To overcome this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst-case scenario to pass or try to update through iTunes.
The phone will guide the user in the final process.
This may include removing apps to get the status, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitated the process with a new tool that suggests removing apps and then reinstalling them when the update is complete.
It is worth making sure that the phone is charged or close to the charger during the update so that the battery does not end in the middle.
If the charging level is too low, Apple won’t let the update progress, because if the battery runs out in the middle, it could lead to an update failure.

Yle: Minister Berner has served on the board of the tax haven company
According to Ylen, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner (centre) has served as a member of the board of the tax haven company.
According to YI, the company’s activities are related to so-called tax planning.
It is a Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo company, whose board member Berner was appointed in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the government.
Berner himself says that he left a notice of resignation in May of this year.
I checked the case and it is enough that I have left a notice of separation.
It is almost impossible to manage and verify that the registration chains will take place on an agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after the merger
Through the Luxembourg company, the ownership of the Swedish company K<0xC3><0xA4>hrs is managed.
K<0xC3><0xA4>hrs is a parking manufacturer that merged with Finnish parking manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served on the Karelia-Upoflor board from 2010 to 2013 and after the merger with the K<0xC3><0xA4>hrs board and the Luxembourg company.
According to Ylen, K<0xC3><0xA4>hrs’s holdings in Luxembourg go through a multi-port ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted government membership in the Luxembourg company K<0xC3><0xA4>hrs at the request of the second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been on Hartwall Capital's Karelia-Upofflora board.
The company was approached by a partner who was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I realized that my own task was to take care of the realisation of the Finnish family company’s capital interests.
It is important that we ensure that the capital gains of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context, Berner says.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital’s holdings in the company are not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up for tax havens is due to the fact that the largest shareholder in K<0xC3><0xA4>hrs, Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for ownership.
The reception centre maintained by the company opens in Espoo
Espoo Otaniemi is the first reception centre maintained by the company for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants as early as this evening.
The number of seats can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Immigration Agency shall establish the premises of the former Rescue Office of the Reception Centre.
The activity is maintained by Luona Oy, whose field of activity is in particular the production of health care and hospital care services.
The city of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy agree, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares alternative work-life tightening package
STTK is preparing an alternative package for the tightening of the government’s working life.
The organization also wishes to include other wage-earners.
According to President Antti Palola, at the moment, the attention is in the statement on Friday.
We will return to alternative ways of reducing the price of work after that.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola noted to reporters during the organization’s board meeting.
Instead, Palola estimates that the Central Union for Economic Life (EC) does not have the capacity to engage in discussions.
The STTK economists have calculated that the change insurance contained in the government’s competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other side of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don’t know if the party has a great deal of enthusiasm to have a debate if there is a one-hundred-to-one relationship on the receiving side.
Palola: Negotiation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> (centre) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, as then the government is going to give its own package of proposals to the parliament and start preparing for the reforms.
I didn’t know if the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a conversational connection with the government, and it has always been constructive for him.
According to Palola, surgery on Sundays in the field of the HRC is a painful place.
The organisation requires the government to withdraw from the mandatory legislation by which it would implement some of the restrictions.
According to Palola, the STTK does not heat the alternative package to be prepared with the SDP that held the case.
On Friday, wage earners will meet in Helsinki to oppose the government’s last week to present a tightening package for working life.
As part of the package, pay for the first sick days is cut, overtime benefits are halved, Sunday benefits are reduced to 75 percent and vacations are reduced.
The STTK emphasises that the central organisations have called on the payees to express their opinion and have not intended to organise a strike.
Akavan Fj<0xC3><0xA4>der
Akava President Sture Fj<0xC3><0xA4>der welcomes the announcement by the STTK on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fj<0xC3><0xA4>der, STTK will now come on the same lines with Akava, as Akava has long been conceived as an alternative model for government presentations.
Fj<0xC3><0xA4>der hopes that SAK will also be included in an alternative package, because without SAK, the package is not comprehensive enough.
Akava President Sture Fj<0xC3><0xA4>der hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lylyn, will prepare the proposal as an alternative to surgery.
Antti Palolan STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, it announced that it has long been preparing its own proposal to negotiate the country's government's target of a 5% competitive advantage as an alternative to surgery.
The plan has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long written an alternative model for government proposals.
We are prepared to consider the terms of the service relationship as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change protection and working time banks,” says President Sture Fj<0xC3><0xA4>der.
Fj<0xC3><0xA4>der hopes that SAK will also come to Akava lines, as STTK has done on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model that goes to the government and employers of the country,” Fj<0xC3><0xA4>der says.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, common coal, talcos" - play bingo on Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> speaking at night

The prime ministers have previously held exceptional speeches during the M<0xC3><0xA4>nts<0xC3><0xA4>l<0xC3><0xA4> rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of the Finnish economy on the Yle Channel on Wednesday evening at 21.05.
When applying for the Prime Minister’s previous speech, it is necessary to go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was Prime Minister while holding a famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the end of the M<0xC3><0xA4>nts<0xC3><0xA4>l<0xC3><0xA4> Rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers held several radio talks during the winter and the post-war period.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave President Mauno Koiviston a New Year's speech, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train operators' strike on television.
Single-speaker, monarchist minions
The Siberian speech has aroused all-day criticism and speculation about what is to come.
The president of the Left Party, Paavo Arhinm<0xC3><0xA4>ki, said on Twitter that "Sipila could hold his speech on the state of the nation in parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, in which case the speech would also be allowed to be discussed".
According to Greenville Niinist<0xC3><0xB6>, "a single call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people, and listening to people.
The SDP’s Erkki Tuomioja said on Facebook that “Monarchist men: the prime minister tells the people what is best for them”.
SDP President Antti Rinne challenged Sipil<0xC3><0xA4>'s dialogue: "Within half a year of elections.
Not just the Prime Minister's appearance in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What is <0x40>juhasipila afraid of?
The Public Service
According to the Office of the Council of State, Sipil<0xC3><0xA4>’s speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was commented directly by the SAK President Lauri Lyly and Jyri Hk<0xC3><0xA4>k<0xC3><0xA4>mies, the President of the EC.
The general public has been criticised for the presentation of the Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> speech.
We considered the matter and stated that it is part of the task of the public service to promote the comprehensive public of the whole of Finland, line up in the news of Ismo Silvo Ylen, the head of Ylen publications.
Like Me in the Tammels
The speech has also sparked outrage.
When the evening comes, dinner is enjoyed in good time, the children are combed and dressed to their best.
The mother puts on a nicer necklace and the father arranges a tie on her neck.
At 9 a.m., we will be silent on television as we used to be during the Me Tammeloi,” writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> also mention in his speech why the Finnish government is sitting in the tax havens of millionaires who are hiding their capital, who make other tax collectors' friends laws of charity, while at the same time claiming to the people that it is necessary to cut when the state has money out of the state?"
From what Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> says, one opinion is presented by the Green Left Viva of the University of Tampere.
It has been published on Facebook along with bingo.
Do we hear of the same boat tonight, the common coal, the burden of living and the team spirit?
The coupons and pens are ready, at 21.05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Suomi and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries reject Russia's proposal to oust al-Assad
The West rejected a Russian offer more than three years ago that would have forced Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to give up power, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian UN envoy proposed a plan by which al-Assad would, after some time, be stripped of power elegantly.
However, the West did not accept the proposal because it believed that al-Assad would fall within a few weeks.
In 2012, Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis with five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, Russian envoy Vitali Tshurkin listed him in a two-way discussion with three points of plan: the opposition could not be armed, the opposition and al-Assad had to immediately get a call and the surrender of al-Assad's power had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all the issues, but we can discuss them openly.
I told him what I did there and he said to sit down, Martti, so I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari remembers in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats do not comment.
Ahtisaari said he had conveyed the message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing had happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the contents of the debate, but according to Ahtisaari there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also declined to comment on Ahtisaari’s claims, but said al-Assad’s forces had already committed several mass killings at the time, and key opposition groups refused all agreements in which he would have remained in power.
Sir John Jenkins, a former head of the Middle East Department of the British Foreign Ministry, is skeptical of Ahtisaari’s remarks because, according to his experience, Russia was at no point ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Russia has officially supported al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari’s claim is that Tshurkin spoke with the Moscow delegation.
If he had told me about Mr Tshurkin's speech, I would have replied that I would like to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin, so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, he would have suspected in that case that it would have been Putin’s decision to hold power with some supporter of al-Assad.
The refugee flow of our own actions
During the negotiations on Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have fled their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no other option but to take good care of these poor people.
We're paying the bill that we ourselves caused," Ahtisaari told the newspaper.
Asylum-seekers’ organisation centre in Turku in Torn<0xC3><0xAD>o
The Government’s Northern Finland-designed Centre for Asylum Seekers is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in an empty building of the Tornio Joint Zone in the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable place to be needed to better manage the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, Helsinki's Sanomat announced that the delegation had already decided to present the school building as a solution for the ministry.
According to Sauli Hy<0xC3><0xB6>ppisen (Vas.), Vice-President of the Town Council of Tornio, this is not the case.
When the whole delegation was not in session and part of the crew wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the delegation meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he specified to the STT.
At the meeting, 36 of the 43 delegates were present.
The organizing centre was opposed by 13 delegates.
On the basis of that, one could expect the decision to be positive, Hy<0xC3><0xB6>ppinen says.
Mayor Timo Nousiainen said the city received no contact on Monday and responded quickly.
The Community is expected to accommodate 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has visited to check that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is parisat meters from the border, so it would work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
SIPIL<0xC3><0x84> is still hoping for an alternative to tightening in the labour market
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> (centre), the public distribution of holiday allowances would only cover part of the government’s goal of calculating the price of work.
The Government, however, would be happy to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations could agree on such a deal.
Mr Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> told reporters in Parliament that he had not been in contact with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously organizations are looking for substitutes for the government’s announced tightening of working life.
If such a contract is concluded, we will take it without fail as part of the entire package.
In Sipil<0xC3><0xA4>’s view, half-boarding would work as a means, since it would be aimed at almost all wage earners, unlike, for example, the government’s planned Sunday cut.
Labour market organisations could agree on the operation of holiday farms, because they are registered in the employment contracts instead of the law.
With these views, the Government will report to the Parliament next Wednesday on the tightening of working life as a Council of State communiqué.
According to Sipil<0xC3><0xA4>, the proposals of the organisations should be aware of this beforehand.
There is no definitive limit to this either.
The legislative work will then go on the move, i.e. the train is on the move and it will be more difficult all the time.
Now is a good time.
It won't be long in things like this, if there's a will, Sipil<0xC3><0xA4> designed it.
The list published last week by the government includes, among other things, the conversion of the stag and stag to unpaid holidays without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the wages of the first sick days are cut, overtime payments are halved, Sunday payments are reduced to 75% and vacations are reduced.
The reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation beyond the trade unions, which has sparked strong criticism.
On Friday, as a result of the measures, the wage-earners organise a large-scale demonstration, in addition to which several trade unions have declared political deadlocks.
The Tohmaj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi delegation approved the extension of the juice management warehouse
The Tohmaj<0xC3><0xA4>rvi Board unanimously approved the expansion of the Nordic Koivu Oy, or the juice management warehouse, for a small number of nuns.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project is larger and more expensive than originally discussed.
It’s also a busy schedule.
It was also little wonder that the demand for space was not known a year ago when it was decided on the previous extension.
At this stage, the expansion of the stockpile by 400-450 square meters was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided later on in the context of the sub-annual report.
There was still talk of an investment of EUR 150 000 to 200 000 on the agenda, but at the meeting the technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price will be estimated at EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenues to the site.
There is no risk to the municipality, as the company pays the investment rent, Vesa V<0xC3><0xA4>ist<0xC3><0xB6> (ps.) argued.
Karjala language in Joensuu
The city government eased its earlier steep stance to bring Karjalan-speaking cotton mills to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in view of the election of a herded tradition throughout the province.
Joensuu is not declared the capital of the Karelia language because it has no historical basis and the Karelia language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been one of the more Eastern Savoie dialects.
After a new decision, there will be no Karjalan-speaking kainami villages in the city centre.
However, the city of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, also ready for the use of the Karjala language, for example in infotainment and tourism marketing.
The same attitude the city recommends to all other players.
Although Joensuu is officially a unilingual municipality, it is also worth considering the use of Karjala language in an avaricious way now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Karjala.
The language of Karjala is still a special feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as a forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can be very useful in a wide range of marketing in the province.
Terminations of train connections cut the vitality of the province
Train connection cuts hit the vitality of the county with a heavy hand.
Transport links have a direct impact on the economic life and competitiveness of the province.
And that affects whether you can live and work here at all, the mayor of Joensuu Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He will also highlight air transport, which has also been followed up by several chapters in the report.
It is important for the entire province that we do not have the opportunity to reduce our powers by measures, as is happening now.
The impact of the closure of these transport links on employment, for example, should be considered, Karjalainen emphasises.
The deterioration of circular connections causes the University of Eastern Finland to face an additional challenge in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services there are, such as traffic connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka M<0xC3><0xB6>nkk<0xC3><0xB6>nen, Rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He notes that poor traffic connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot because of the research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Head of Recruitment, says that marketing the university to Western Finland is already difficult at the moment, as traffic connections are weak in the opposite direction.
About half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside of Eastern Finland.
About 10-20 percent of them are from the Baltic Sea, which is partly explained by direct train connections.
The river became one of my songs for you.
The view of the city government in Joensuu from the regional Siu sote project is apparently unanimous, but one of the sora sounds is among them.
Pentti Keskisalo, a member of the city government (sd., pictured) presented the resignation of the entire project at a Monday meeting of the government, but his presentation fell out of favor.
The Board of Directors adopted a resolution by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from Kotka to Kouvola ends next year
The passenger traffic from Kotka to Kouvola will be maintained in the future, even if only one train pair is less frequent.
There will be changes to passenger traffic between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One pair of trains leaves, but still five a day passes from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The cuts are due to the government’s austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications will reduce the purchase costs of rail transport by EUR 12.3 million for the next four years.
The quietest routes will be completely stopped.
VR is preparing new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed to the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys swam out of place
The rescue agency rescued a 12-year-old man who climbed from the chip to the roof, who could not get his own help from the roof.
The situation occurred in Tornionm<0xC3><0xA4>e Ketoti at half past six o'clock on Tuesday evening.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no stairs leading to the roof.
It did not stop the boy group who decided to climb the roof of the house along the scale of the radio amateurs next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, the other survivors were relieved and the passers-by alerted the rescue agency to help the trailers safely back to the ground.
FedEx’s operating profit doubles, lowers tax outlook for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results in the last quarter, and the supply surplus cut year-round earnings forecasts, due to the declining demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it is hiring 50,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
Its share decreased by about 2.5 per cent in the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening hours of the Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. says it expects $10.40-10.90 as a result of the tax year ending next May, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to the FactSet survey.
Despite an average of 4.9 per cent increase in prices, which will come into effect on January 4, and despite the higher surcharges for heavy or large parcel land transports beginning in November.
The company said it expects operating profit to continue to grow from the previous year, as they have cut costs, sales have increased and online commerce is on the rise.
President and CEO Fred Smith said that the company “will be performing stably given the expected weaker economic conditions, especially in production and global trade.”
Plans for salaries for the holiday were announced the day after competitor UPS said it plans to hire 90-95,000 extra workers, about the same as it did last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx’s earnings stood at $692 million, up 6% from last year.
Profit per share came in at $2.42, which is left from the $2.44 average estimate. A survey of 12 analysts conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Net sales rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks’ survey, six analysts expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has suffered a decline in international priority transport, which has halted the development of its Express unit’s turnover.
However, the increase in online trading has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the unit’s turnover increased by 29 per cent, but the revenues of operations were basically the same due to the expensive costs of larger packages and self-insurance.
The income of the Express unit was better because of higher basic fees, while operating profit in freight operations was lower than labour costs.
At the opening auction about an hour before the opening hours, FedEx shares dropped to $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
FedEx closed 11 per cent on Tuesday, down from a record low of 17 per cent on June 11.
This week, the decision-makers of the U.S. Central Bank are sitting around a huge stomach table for two days to decide whether it is time to raise the control rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the central bank’s decorative, two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues, must put the economic interests of the nation ahead of everything else.
Congress has placed a dual responsibility on the shoulders of the central bank: they must maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
However, after the big bang, the central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
It is precisely this third requirement that can be a decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted. The decision on whether the US economy is ready to be drawn from a record-setting stimulus, which has almost reached its peak since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows that the economy is growing steadily, the recent collapse in the global financial market may have made the central bank officials already on the lookout for more savings, which will lead to an increase in instability.
“Understanding the labour market and inflation are the first and most important factors to follow,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“However, I believe that if they seek the justification for the continuation of interest rates, the increased uncertainty in the world market is a sufficiently valid reason to wait,” he says.
The decision of the Central Bank has not been agreed, which is already causing nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent Bloomberg study, about half of economists predict that interest rates will rise this week.
The financial markets, in turn, expect the central bank to delay the hike, as according to the key indicator, the potential for growth is only around 30 %.
This refers to the downturn in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision-makers succeed in softening the blow by promising that the next uptake will not happen in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose by 228.89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, with a new figure of 16,599.85.
The recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank will maintain its level this week, says John Lonski, Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group’s chief financial officer.
“It’s surprising that the central bank is raising interest rates right now,” he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, “they need to see a lot of effort in their alignment to support the financial market so that they don’t panic.”
Other experts argue that the increased level would calm the financial market, as it would remove uncertainty about when the central bank would operate.
Only a month ago it seemed that the central bank would raise interest rates by a quarter percentage point this month, thus taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the monetary economy, which would ensure the stability of the recovery of the United States.
Yellen has stated in the spring and spring that he expects the level to rise this year despite the fact that the Liberals demand more economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed in August, job market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest figure in seven years and close to what the central bank considers to be the limit of full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of exacerbation.
While inflation is still below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, the central bank’s decision-makers say that this is due to a significant temporary impact on the price of low oil.
The economy is "clear from even higher interest rates and also needs them in view of the tight labour market situation", says Ian Shepherdson, senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were stagnant last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index fell by as much as 16 percent from its May record, as investors feared China’s slowing economy would also slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10 percent below its peak in May.
For the central bank’s decision-makers, market volatility is an additional factor in a complex equation that explains why interest rates need to be raised.
“Without these financial market events and recent news of China’s weakness in the economy, the decision-makers would tighten up at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, an expert at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Central Bank official.
Now he predicts that decision-makers are waiting at least a month to get a better understanding of the effects.
“The potential impact on the U.S. economy is still quite unclear, and they don’t have much information on how it will affect the consequences of China’s events,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the international economy is not the central bank’s main concern, so it should not, in principle, affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Central Bank has become the world’s money authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been immense.
In 2013, then-president Ben S. Bernanke’s suggestion that the central bank could “depreciate” the increase in the amount of money led to market revolutions around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly reddened, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The central bank’s decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of Envestnet Inc’s global strategy.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia, said this month that “the central bank has previously overreacted to the financial market movement that has seemed to be separate from the fundamentals of the economy.”
The decision-making Federal Open Market Committee has called for interest rates to be raised, and Lacker, a member of the committee entitled to vote, cites the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points during three meetings “despite its limited, identifiable effects on U.S. economic growth,” Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank canceled these cuts.
The Central Bank should put economic stability at the top only during a major crisis, such as when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s Central Bank’s crowning committee.
The last millerrys do not come anywhere near its level, Posen says.
“No one wants a situation where interest rates are afraid of rising because the market is getting worse,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act (Federal Reserve Act) still contains a double requirement and does not mention economic stability. As long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

Brazil's Children's Health Organization in Rio Grandes Announces Healthy Diet for Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatrics organization SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to get women to understand the importance of a good diet during breastfeeding by publishing pictures of babies sucking breasts, which have been painted descriptions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the necessary nutrients for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that adding calories isn’t the only dietary change that moms should do.
A recent study led by Baylor College of Medicine professor Robert Waterland revealed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects babies from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
Seven-Channel Sunrise is a favorite in the audience, despite Nine-Channel’s efforts to update the executive release in the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson’s raid on Canberra to inform the Liberal Party’s leaders of the post-liberal purge failed to increase Today’s viewership.
The Nine Channel morning program was broadcast from the country's capital after Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott.
The competitive program Sunrise, played by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of its week-long international broadcast series, which also covers the Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It did not seem to hurt Australian TV viewers at all, as Sunrise’s viewership average was 397,000 in five state capitals, compared with 339,000 in Today’s.
Today's average rose slightly on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has caught Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today had an average of 318,000 and Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers varied.
As of September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers, while Today has a figure of 314,000.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
Changes in the wind are blowing this morning elsewhere than in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are doing well, thanks for asking!
Posted by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news for Seven was the 800-word series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing first appearance.
The new drama series, which garnered an impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the New Zealand coast with his two children.
Critics have wondered whether Thomson would be a force to carry the popular series on its own without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The results of last night gave this real certainty.
The Seven Channel X Factor was a strong favorite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning the Block series (838 000) and the TBL Families series (726 000).
The Seven Channel had a double fate on the second night of The Chase Australia series.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new curfew program garnered an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17:30-18) raised 623,000 spectators – which was a small enough win over Eddie McGuire’s Hot Seat program (613,000).
On Monday evening, The Chase Australia’s first half-hour viewership average was 520,000, and the second half-hour figure was a staggering 720,000.
The average Hot Seat was 620,000.
The second night’s drop in the viewership of The Chase Australia brings confidence to the Nine channel that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular show at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the viewership of the McGuire program.

The final three agree with the father that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
Is the secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski accidentally revealed who won The Bachelor series.
The woman’s identity has been kept extremely secret, with whom Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls don't really stick out who got the last rose.
However, when we spoke with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows a day before the three came in two, they could, however, inadvertently give clues about the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's finale
All three women were thrown into confusion as to how perfect Wood is by mentioning his humor, ambition, family value, and positivity as to why they would like to be his partner.
However, when asked “If Wood’s last rose is not for you, who should it go to?”, their answers might offer a revelation of who won the boy’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay's best alternative to Wood after themselves.
The relationship between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been seamless since day one.
“From the moment I walked into the house, [Sarah’s] energies and Sam’s energies felt quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind for the whole series,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
“Sarah is really close to the earth, it’s fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They feel comfortable and relaxed together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would fit very well together.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be "the right one".
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game – I’m now with my whole heart here,” he said.
Asking who Wood was supposed to pick if he wasn't, Mackay was suspicious.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I like the girls I have left as much, so it's a balance game between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 19.30 on the Ten channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start his NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both quite interested in his move to the United States, and many other teams have asked him about his impressive open training days since the end of last year.
Hayne, however, chose the San Francisco 49ers as well as coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Haynen on the bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugby league reverse dropped the ball in his first flight back to the team when he won the Minnesota 20-3 on Tuesday.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Haynen return the next plane crash and took her to the running game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula’s real character was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of plunging his newcomers into a pawn in front of the other team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
49ers specialist Cam Inman reported that Haynea was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped a flying saucer that the Minnesota Vikings captured in the first leg of the game
This really wasn’t the beginning that Hayne and her many Australian fans hoped for for a man’s NFL debut.
Haynen was seen cursing on the way out of the field after the fall, and later he told Australian radio couple’s Hamish & Andy 2DayFM channel at a frequency of 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
“It was just one of those things, you just have to think about the next game and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared his jump to his 2007 Origin debut when feeding in his own target area led to Queensland's goal.
Overall, it was a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed for her Instagram account to publish a photo with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun threatening the Siberian runway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was captured, and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
Four killed in police shooting at protesters in Nepal, police say
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets on a crowd that expressed their minds against the country's new constitutional proposal, the official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandeh area about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the region’s top official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and firebombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resorting to rubber seats.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets known to have killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, appeared to have caused so many deaths.
In the recent weeks of violent demonstrations, there have been protests across the southern Nepali plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that the new provinces set up under the proposed new constitution are undermining their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal when the Tharus group demands its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, 11 of whom have been police officers.
At the time, four main parties signed an agreement that divided the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial matter in Nepal, which has had central government for centuries.
The new constitution has been planned since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process since the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
The legislators have voted this week on the sentences in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu, and the authorities have said that a new constitution could be approved by Sunday.
The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) says there’s a 60 percent chance of a hurricane south of Cape Verde
Across the wide low-pressure side, about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde archipelago, there is a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
On the other side of the tight-knit low pressure, located in the middle of the Cape Verde archipelago and the Lesser Antilles, there is also a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the weather forecast center in Miami added.
Google launches a donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has launched a donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees who have come to Europe as they flee the brink of war and impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptional personal perspective in its publication of the donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of being made a statement by a manager, his personal experience was written by Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven.
"We saw a number of dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has increased, people like my family desperately want to help.
The donations will be given to four non-profit organizations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save Children, and the UN Refugee Agency’s chief executive.
According to Google, it is equivalent to every donation made globally on Google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million, so the total goal is $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, and the main reason for this is Syria’s four-year civil war, which has driven more than 4 million people out of its homes this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Dietary surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
According to the new study, the benefits of weight loss surgery from type 2 diabetics who are mildly obese can last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after a weight loss surgery than those treated in other ways than surgery.
“Getting mortality data takes a long time,” says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He is a weight loss specialist who wrote the main article for a new study in the journal JAMA Surgery.
In bariatric surgery, various methods are used to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the people involved in the study have been sickly muscle, and their weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, the ratio of weight to length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If the BMI is over 25, it indicates that someone is overweight, and if the person has BMI over 30, he is considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, abdominal bypass surgery, and a reduction in abdominal pain, a type 2 diabetes mellitus, to treat people with drug-induced mucosa.
The study showed that the average BMI of the cut-off subjects dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the five years.
At the same time, those treated by other means than surgery, BMI remained mostly the same at 29.
Of the people with diabetes, 36% were fully cured and 28% were partially cured.
By comparison, in a medically treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1 percent and partially by about 2 percent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgery group,” the authors noted.
The researchers also followed patients' blood haemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels over the long term.
Hemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, haemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
In the treatment group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
However, this better "glycemic control" described by improved haemoglobin A1c levels did not reduce mortality over five years, says lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu with colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean scores between two different types of surgery.
In the five-year period, when compared with the proportion of patients in the gastrointestinal tract, the proportion of patients in the gastrointestinal tract decreased by more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the weight index decreased by more (7.4 and 5.1), the proportion of patients in the gastrointestinal tract decreased by less than 16%, the proportion of patients in the gastrointestinal tract, and the proportion of patients in the gastrointestinal tract decreased by more than 16% (7.4 and 5.1).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that while the study does not appear to be a survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where the surgery led to a longer lifespan in more obese people.
The Swedish study found that overweight people who underwent weight loss surgery were 29% less likely to die in a 15-year period when compared to a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
While the new study does not appear to improve the survival of surgery patients, Blackstone says the results are encouraging, however, for people with BMI less than 35 who are interested in surgery.
“The results of the study are crucial precisely in that they show that surgery is safe for a group of lower weight indexes,” and do not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when the patient’s BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we wait too long before we take this seriously,” he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his or her body for obesity and diabetes, cancelling the situation is very difficult.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in the homelands of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech, which he held at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of his ten-day visit to Britain, dedicated to the study of ethics.
The Dalai Lama claimed that in the current situation, the needs of all humanity should be put before individual nations or even the continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also insufficient.
“Not everyone can come to Europe,” he said.
While the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's actions in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“It is great to care for several thousand refugees, but in the meantime we have to think about long-term solutions: how to bring real peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The main thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
In addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the US’ violent response led to chain boundaries events.
“After 9/11, I presented my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem can be found through non-violence.
I know his motivations were good, but he used force and it created unexpected consequences,” the Dalai Lama said.
During the last four years, the number of hand sanitizers in children has increased fourfold.
Poisoning prevention centers across the U.S. have reported a nearly 400 percent increase in alcohol-containing hand sanitizers in children under 12 years of age since 2010, according to the Center for Toxicology in Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, head of the Georgian Toxicology Centre, the reported cases of disinfection in the Toxicology Centres in children under 12 years of age rose from 3,266 cases in 2010 to 16,117 cases in 2014.
“Children are more interested in these products and unfortunately, a certain percentage of them are going to be caught up in the update,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink the disinfectant intentionally, while others want to make an impact on their friends or respond to the challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink the disinfectant to get a cheap rise pattern.
According to reports, teens have mixed the disinfectant in an alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
The pleasant scents of the disinfectant can attract younger children.
“The kid doesn’t think this is bad for him,” Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (hand gestures) are those to which the smell has been added.
There are strawberry, grapefruit and orange-oxidative disinfectants that are very attractive in children’s minds.
The hand sanitizer can contain any alcohol between 45 and 95 percent.
Especially in young children, only a few sprays are needed for alcohol intoxication.
"It's really condensed alcohol," Stephen Thornton, director of the University of Kansas's Toxicology Center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you shouldn’t leave a whisky shot on the table, but hand sanitizer is left on display, and if children are interested in it, it’s a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who some time ago swallowed just four sprays of hand sanitizer at school, and was taken to first aid care.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the limit of adult horse drinking, said Chris Ritchey, a primary care physician at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah nodded and was unable to walk when he arrived at the first aid.
Doctors followed her overnight at a separate children’s hospital for possible brain disorders, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and shave her head, Ritchey said.
“It was really scary,” Nhaijah’s mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
The situation could have been a killer for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and move the disinfectant out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcoholic beverages, some disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after ingesting a hand sanitizer containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
The health authorities took the view that the product contained methanol, a killing agent, and not ethyl alcohol, which had been reported as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of New York State, three fourth-graders planned to poison their "early" teacher by spreading bacterial contamination to the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the disinfectant of the hands and prohibited it from being classified.
The police should prevent the plan from being "profoundly defamatory" and leave the disciplinary action to the school district.
Huhumylly: Celtic has no objections
Griffiths refuses to talk about Celtic's contradictions, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight spot, but she gets it turned around.
Hearts is fighting the Scottish Football League over Neilson's allegations, and Warburton is on alert for January recruits that may disrupt the team's unity
Dons raised his lead to Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney's first-half penalty kick took Aberdeen to a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium and gave the team the opportunity to increase the gap to Celtic by five points.
Griffiths is reluctant to talk about conflict.
Rumors of Celtic's internal contradictions have arisen, but Griffiths immediately passed them. He claims that he and his teammates have no more sense of working under the watchful eye when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch series leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship makes the Dutch bored - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition from the championship with Rangers.
Ajax’s current ambassador, de Boer, said: “The Netherlands is no longer showing the highlights of the Celtic games and why?”
Because the Rangers aren't involved.
People here can't just talk about Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and they're interested in that.
There are a lot of tensions in the games of these teams, and also other than the Scots want to keep track of those games.
Deila vows to turn around the situation
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn around the situation.
The loss to Malm<0xC3><0xB6> and the resulting loss to the Champions League was quickly followed by the loss of ten men to Aberdeen, who are now at the top of the series by five points to the next.
However, Deila said, “Celtic has had bad periods before, and we will rise again.”
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is disappointing and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
Yes, we are, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of the players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton Warns of Player Transfers in January
Although Rangers boss Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible player transfers targets in January, he is on the lookout for the most intimidating assurance that he does not want to confuse the team with unanimity.
The former Brentford boss said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
As for the upcoming players in the summer, the adjustment time is the whole time ahead, which is evident in our team this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic’s interest target Michu hints at retirement
Swansea striker Michu, whose name is attached to Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted that he may retire after his contract with Swans ends.
The 29-year-old has had nail designs for two years, and he failed to find a new one outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish Football League over Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated from the field, and the team lost 3-2 after this. The defender's red card was later cancelled, and this was the third red card already awarded by Collum, which was cancelled during the last eight months.
Neilson stays behind his message saying, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on the performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
A faithful Hibernian player was beaten to death after receiving a song from former Hearts player Rudi Skacela from his singer.
The event took place in a pub in Edinburgh's Roseburn, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a moment's thought," the striker added, "It's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle, otherwise I'm going to play Celtic."
Tannadic government believes in Dundee United leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that Dundee United’s government still has faith in the management team’s ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the deterioration of players must end.
“I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back in shape," Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy about the "black win" in Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, were desperate to take part in the game against Hamilton Accies, but was able to reach their seventh consecutive overtime win, bringing them to the top of the table at the top of the table, thanks to the penalty kick of Adam Rooney's first half.
McInnes said: “There is no team that would have won anything, whether it was a trophy or too much that would not have won games like this.”
Scotland's Unemployment Remains the Same as Britain's Total Growth
Employment in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of the UK rose by 10,000 to a total of 1.82 million.
Scotland's unemployment rate is 5.9 per cent higher than the UK's 5.5 per cent, according to figures from the National Statistics Centre (ONS).
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12,000 people over a three-month period, and the number of employed persons now stands at 2,612,000.
Scotland’s employment rate fell to 74 per cent during the quarter, which is higher than the UK’s average of 73.5%.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on the latest figures: “The government’s long-term plan is to build a foundation for a stronger economy.”
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the UK.
During these 12 months, the labour market in Scotland has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why I Witness Execution in Oklahoma
If any kind of legal intervention does not take place, I will look later today when the man is executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'm sitting in an Oklahoma State Penitentiary prison, watching Richard Glossip executed with a lethal syringe.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
I received a request in January through her best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I'm starting to feel sad today as I approach it.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, publishers have the opportunity to track executions in America, and because applications are often more than vacancies, participants are chosen through appalling valuation.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats to 12.
Whoever gets elected, looks at the event as cool.
I can't do that.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and I have also created my own contact with him through the calls made over the months, as well as a two- and a half-hour visit.
I like the man.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can’t be both a witness and a reporter, so I must not have a notebook and a pen with me to record what I saw.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of being a victim of my indifference.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, and you'll get involved.
I chose the publisher.
He admitted that "you could have put your words better", but still believes that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it if he did.
I've told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants there to be an international journalist who writes about it.
If the Glossip dies, he believes that the public will help the anti-death penalty trend.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is right next to me.
If you want to know more about the story, you can listen to the podcasts I’ve done in the series.
I will not go through all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Trees, his actions would in any case turn him into a culpable help.
But I think there's a very strong chance he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And so this is the perspective from which I see him dying.
I can't say I'm completely unbiased.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of how it feels to watch when the man I like dies unnecessarily.
A man was dragged out of the Canning River after a police raid
Canning Valen's officer remained dry as he lured the man out of the Canning River.
The attempt by a man from Perth to deceive police on his heels went wrong when he found himself on a low, muddy water just a few yards from a policeman who was trying to "teach him softly back to the beach".
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for an unauthorized intrusion.
When they discovered the suspect, this tried to trick them by heading for the Canning River.
However, he did not get very far.
“He stood in the water saying, ‘I’m not coming out, come get me,’” said Senior Chief Executive Officer Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want his uniform to sink, so he used a safer tactic: "good police negotiation".
“Sometimes people do funny things when they try to escape,” said Castledine, a senior chief executive officer.
Master football player Ben Cousins is a remarkable example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a blowout and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his endeavor, but inspired the locals to start designing the playful Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims officials tried to spy on him and threatened to end the competition
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria’s agents tried to infiltrate his spies into his deposits last year, and threatened to end the competition immediately.
He accuses the officials and Racing Victoria's non-gift department of claiming that they have a personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, Lady Tata's late rejection of the treatment on race day was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has been in a difficult situation since Lidar’s unexplained positive cobalt show.
He has kept his tongue in check on the spy claims for a year and a half, and did not want it to “look like jealousy.”
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it's so frustrating that everything goes away at once," Moody said.
They knew the situation would continue.
Sometimes I just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk my head upright and I want the owners to think that I will do my best in front of them.
When they start to think differently, then I should no longer continue as a coach.
Then I'd have to think about what I'm doing to my licensee.
Moody previously tipped the bomb in an interview with racing.com, in which he said that the nonprofit department had been trying to spy on his mansion.
“Thirteen and a half years ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with the man – name him when he asked him – and offered him a job on my tapes if he cared about what I was doing there.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should indeed separate their lawyers, for they have failed in my capture.
Robert Roulston, former President of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current President of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I start thinking that this is going to be personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to team up and perhaps transfer responsibility to non-trainers about what’s going on in the industry?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I so harmful to the industry?
Maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me apart, and I have no doubt that the things I said now may not make them think exactly that.
But I'm now at the point where I don't care anymore, and it's killing me.
It really makes me sad.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach’s frustration has grown with Lidar’s long-term cobalt research, and a late rejection led him to conclude that he could “throw his license over the table.”
Moody, who is best known for training the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the race day’s treatment rule “raised” after the mutated or clay shark has been placed on the horse’s feet, which is against the rules.
“It’s against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees made the mistake of changing it on his feet.
It could have been a grave last night.
It could have been yesterday, as it was.
It was the race day.
Moody may have a three-month ban on competition due to the day of the race, from which the officials started the investigation.
That's a joke.
People who make these rules don’t know anything about horses.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
In Cobram, the driver charged with the transport package was arrested.
Police have arrested a man who was charged with a traffic jam after hitting his biker on the weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he suffered serious injuries when a car crashed into him in Murray Valley on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalya reported himself to police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with not stopping in an accident, neglect of help, and other traffic jams.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Team Coach Craig Bellamy Attacks Competitors in Pressure Claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the two NRL champions’ favourites for arguing that his team’s tackles would be part of the “line”.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referee allowed Storm's "weight" on his side when he unexpectedly won the finals in Sydney on Friday evening.
Coach Wayne Bennett of the Brisbane Broncos barely managed to cover up his reference to the Storm after it won the North Queensland Cowboys in the finals on Saturday evening. Bennett called the game a "showcase" of the rugby league and said that the two innings of the Queensland game would not be a "squad."
Bellamy defended his team's tackles and said they only focus on "contact" when tackled.
Bellamy added that his confidence added to the criticism of Stormy by the two leading coaches, as it means they are afraid of losing to the team.
"This is always going to be a talk - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about the pressure when we lost them 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything in our defense systems or our techniques all year round. Over the last six weeks, we’ve just pressed contact in the tackles, and it’s made us succeed.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, and so this was a little shock to him.
Funny how this is always going to be talked about this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "exciting rugby" by reminding the mentor that Bennett-trained St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "silently".
Wayne's talking about exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and tell how exciting their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn’t care less.
But now he has a team that is able to play the rugby that we think is exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
You also want to play such a game when you have its types of players.
He brought it up in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby — not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I feel more confident when they say things like that because they’re a little worried about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as opposing important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Storm and the Roosters was more slick than played between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was definitely a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals but is it an exciting rugbyy?
Or is it a violation of an exciting line of defense and a failure to paint?
This is about the lines for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks for the Saturday night pre-finals at AAMI Park. Tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
A $200,000 guarantee for a Serbian man on a drug charge
A man threatened by a possible life-threatening 40-kilogram holding company smuggled into Queensland has been released on a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police traced 100 kilograms of drugs to a Solay yacht that came to South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting other defendants in the dock all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilos of drugs from the Toyota Echo.
While Maksimovic threatens a potential life-long business holding company, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maksimovic tried to keep the full amount in his possession, and that he might be in the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has strong ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Maksimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and father had together offered a $200,000 guarantee to ensure his release.
“Having read the false evidence of both individuals, it is clear that putting a $200,000 guarantee sum on them is a real financial burden,” Judge Flanagan said.
But it alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing before the court, he warned.
Maksimovic was given a guarantee on the condition that he hand over both his Australian and Serbian passports, informs the police on a daily basis, and keeps his foreign travel ban between the evening and the morning.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to attract pedophiles to send pictures
Pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl to sleep on this phone and then logged in to the online communications service, where Hogg received a number of unscrupulous pictures of the children that another user sent him.
The girl woke up later, noticed that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
The girl examined her phone and found shocking messages, after which she immediately told her mother about it.
When police saw five images, they looked at the computers on the scene and found "concerned" web images with search terms that had been used to search for unsightly images taken of children.
Hogg later claimed to police that he had done this "to harass pedophiles" online before he "appeared to be a policeman to scare them".
Fiscal deputy Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court the following: "He said that it is an addiction - that he is dependent on scaring people.
He admitted that he had performed the funeral on a computer but said that they had been done only because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer in order to protect the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations with the unknown person who sent him pictures, and about when Hogg asked the person to send additional pictures.
Hogg said he only did this for the purpose of feeding.
He said that after drinking, he's sick, and he wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she cried out to her mother, shaking and crying.
The mother saw the naked pictures on the phone and then met the defendant.
The girl was interviewed, and she told me that the accused had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked her younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to making or taking pictures of innocent children on June 14 of last year. He broke his guarantee on January 25 of this year and left to come to court on May 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim called for Hogg not to be included in the sex offender register, as it could be argued that his crime did not include a "significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal delayed the sentence until October, so that the social action has time to prepare background reports.
Hoggi was given guarantees in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is under arrest before trial.
He was added to the sexual offenders register before the day of conviction.
Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe gave the wrong speech to parliament
Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell on the stairs leading to the speaker’s rise earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of the fall was spread by the virus on social media.
The arguments of the opposition legislators that they had been sent anonymous death threats were also ignored by the openings of Parliament, in which they were warned that Mugabe would be beaten during his speech.
In the last month, they sat down and interrupted him with a speech on the state of the country to Parliament, which he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the group leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them of disrupting Mugabe’s speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not match, but the message is titled 'death'," Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the relevant members that the immunity will end in Parliament, and when they step out, the parliamentary immunity will not be valid.
The group’s supervisor said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was “concerned” about the threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard cuts up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is committed to cutting between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its reorganisation and cost-cutting efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP will split into two listed companies, separating its computer and print business from its faster-growing enterprise hardware and service operations.
Expected job cuts will bring about $2.7 billion in costs starting from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These reorganisation measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of HP, which heads the unit after the split.
“The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current HP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help businesses move into a new kind of business,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual revenue will be over $50 billion, and it “focuses on producing unrivalled integrated technology solutions” for companies, the company said in a statement.
The company was founded in the 1930s by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, a graduate of Stanford University, to produce electrical supplies. The company operated in a car garage in Palo Alto, called the "Birthplace of the Bay Area".
HP has gone through a huge reorganization to manage the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., and its distribution is the latest in an industry based on the belief that tightly-restricted companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb's game
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it’s only September now, and assuming he’s recovering as planned, there’s no reason why he wouldn’t be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire will miss at least four of England's next games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in next summer's European championships.
The biggest regret about this latest issue is that Wilshere’s end of the last season was strong after a single tie, and he remembered his old sharpness before the start of the season.
"Such an injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's nothing weird.
It was just an accident.
It's not related to his ankles or previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, when the player tries to return through the middle there is always the risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern.
A study by Premier Injuries Ltd shows Wilshere has had 23 different injuries since his debut six years ago.
In addition, he has played 157 of Arsenal’s 157 league games in just 65 games over the last five seasons.
Looking at Arsenal's wider total after the 2007-08 season, six of the eight seasons it has been the second of the teams in the Champions League to lose the most days due to injury.
Wenger concedes the possibility of a tie, but Arsenal believes that their last season's improvement will continue in injury testing.
“Sometimes when you return from a disability, there may be a season when you need to strengthen the body and get the competition,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure that's what happens, and that he gets to make a career that he deserves.
Wenger prepares to regroup his team as Arsenal start their Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then play on Saturday against Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Héctor Beller<0xC3><0xAD>n and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be at the start.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give breath to the players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear follow-up to the F-block, Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is the most frightening stadium in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost in 41 games since they produced their own "Undefeated" campaign last season.
On Tuesday, the stadium was hit by an earthquake with a magnitude of 3.2 on Richter's scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal have learned about last season’s Champions League commitment to Monaco, and he is motivated by an increasingly distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup win.
“This motivation is huge,” Wenger said.
Arsenal have never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: A Comedy Series That Taught Us Serious Things About Men's Friendship
It is striking how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially given that the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and is three times more common in men than women.
The company’s Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the year of men. The goal was to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
The recent study involved more than 2,000 high school and high school students who showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, a person's chance of recovery doubled if a high enough percentage of his friends were "healthy".
Similarly, those who were not depressed were less likely to have any potential mental health problems if they had healthy friends in their mind.
But in order for friendship to work, it must first be available.
In this social media, in the time of communication, the style goes beyond the content and the immediateness of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy, and successful, even though in reality isolation is ruled by.
This superficial success is governed by values that psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All this is done at the expense of internal values - internal desire for personal growth and friendship - that have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer just explained, money really doesn’t get more happiness.
The beauty of the friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
No character defined their work, but rather their personality, which was clearly distinguished in the interaction as friends. . . .
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross's dismay at Rachel - their sense of humor came from knowing that yes, men can be like this all the time, even though they often hesitate to explore their emotions completely.
As the Samaritan volunteer explained to me: "When I listen to people who are depressed and self-conscious, I really understand how the slightest interaction with a friend can improve my mood."
Often, men who contact us experience that they can’t talk to friends.
The old idea of "overcoming" is strong, as well as the feeling that if you open up to problems, you see yourself as weak.
Friends is one of those series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term ways to survive.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
While my unbiased, outside position on the other end of the phone helps people in times of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you’re attending Comedy Central’s FriendsFest this weekend, and all the filming locations are re-designed to honor the party, why not take your friends for coffee at Central Perk.
Or, what’s even better, if you see someone in Starbucks alone, smiling and saying hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, join #FriendsFest
Di Maria makes the goal and helps PSG to get to Malm<0xC3><0xB6>
Angel Di Maria celebrates Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malm<0xC3><0xB6>.
Angel Di Maria scored the goal in his Champions League debut helping PSG overtake the Swedish team in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> on Tuesday.
Below the match report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started their Champions League game with a comfortable 2-0 win against Malm<0xC3><0xB6> at the Parc des Princess on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the Champions League debut in less than four minutes, showing the French league champions the way, but the team lost several chances before finally adding to their lead in Cavan's hit in the 61st minute of the match.
Paris, which is in the same Group A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as the game had not only a place to go, but also an improvement in their quarter-finals in the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the points, it wasn’t a classic game, as Laurent Blanc’s team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the spot in front of the goal and was later replaced from the field. Malm<0xC3><0xB6> is his old hometown team and that team where he started to excel in his career in 1999.
“It’s not easy in the Champions League to win at home or abroad, so a 2-0 win will cause problems for the opponent and look good in the stats, and it’s a good start, even though there are things we’re going to get to grips with this season,” Blanc said.
This was a good prediction.
We wanted to win and we won, even though we didn’t manage to make one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after injury with three changes after the team stayed in the 2–2 home game of Ligue 1 against Bordeaux on the weekend, but he stayed in the fourth minute in the shadow of Di Maria.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentinian striker was named a man who took PSG to a new level in Europe, and he testified why when Marco Verratt was running the innings behind the Malm<0xC3><0xB6> defensive line and then hit the beautiful finishing line behind Johan Wiland.
However, if someone expected an easy and big win from PSG, he was disappointed.
Malm<0xC3><0xB6> was a fierce opponent, winning the Celtics in the finals to this level, with nine international players and a five-man defense, as well as two players in a deep midfield.
But the team offered almost nothing on the offensive side except for Nikola Djurdjic's shot in the 34th minute, which went past the button of the nip from Kevin Trapp's pitch.
On the other hand, PSG was interrupted by the loss of power and poor finish, especially Ibrahimovic, who failed in all five attempts only in the first half and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball into Ibrahimovic’s touch immediately after the other half.
However, he was much more effective in performing his work with his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic’s input that Di Maria sent a round-trip shot that weighed around Wiland’s goal goal in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored an hour after the game, thanks to the Uruguayan Cavan who scored his sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had seen Maxwell's cross-breed on the left.
It ended Malm<0xC3><0xB6>'s hopes of getting back into the game, and only Wiland's brilliant fight for David Luiz's direct kick kept the final numbers down before Ezekiel Lavez's goal from the exchange was rejected at the very end of the game.
Malm<0xC3><0xB6> coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was at the same level as his team. The Norwegian said: "The last time we played in the Champions League was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
Fighting is not enough.
I'll get a hat for Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore to raise $2.5 billion in stock sales
The Swiss mining industry left Glencore, which suffered from commodity price volatility, on Wednesday raised $2.5 billion by selling shares as part of its broad debt-to-equity plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold new shares for around <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices, as the slowdown in China’s economy puts a strain on demand and wreaks havoc on all markets.
The rebranding raised the value of Glencore’s shares at the top of the London Stock Exchange’s mid-week morning stores.
Shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100 index, which opened by 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had revealed a $2.5 billion share deal last week as part of its broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt by about a third.
The company sold a new equity capital of 125 pence, which meant a 2.4% reduction in Tuesday’s decision price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, with a total value of 9.99 per cent of the merger.
Concerns about China’s long-standing slowdown in growth have cut prices by roughly half, while prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20-40%.
White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House said in a statement released Tuesday.
Xin's first official visit to Washington takes place on September 25 and is in response to President Barack Obama's last November visit to Beijing, the statement said.
U.S. President Michelle Obama and his wife Michelle Obama are organizing a dinner for Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, after the leaders have held bilateral talks.
“President Xin’s visit will give us the opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues, while at the same time giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to constructively discuss issues that are of common interest,” he said.
With the visit, which was first announced in February, Xin is expected to also differ in Seattle on his trip to Washington to meet with a number of U.S. technology leaders before moving on to New York City and the U.S. General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyberbullying and the country’s increased uncertainty in disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon Is Decreasing the Difference in Filmmaking
Matt Damon and Effie Brown met with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown in their discussion of the difference that Damon says is not needed behind the scenes.
On HBO’s Sunday evening episode of Project Greenlight, an actor who experienced this interrupted Brown by emphasizing the need for different perspectives on the project’s chosen script for the dark-haired main character.
“When we talk about diversity, it’s taken into account when choosing actors for a movie, not a series,” Damon said.
Shocked Brown reacts unbelievably to the hurt, commenting "Oh! Wow. Okay", while the Martian actor's comments were left to air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrell’s brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series’ finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think, whoever the director is, how they treat Harmony’s character,” Brown said.
The only dark figure is a whore who is beaten by his white mate.
The Dear White People producer demanded the rights to direct the film to the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon quietly replied that their direction "could end up giving us something we don't want".
When the conversation was posted, social media exploded to disgust Damon’s comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his disapproval of the film, writing: "Matt Damon speaking about the only dark person in the room and explaining to him the difference is SO WHICH it hurts."
After its release, the band collected over 5,000 re-releases and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s comments point to the time when a precise racial presentation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After the white police killed teen Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement spread across the country and urged lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices of color-blind people.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the movement by presenting the album nominees for the Grammy Award.
“The album still matters,” he said.
As with books and black lives, albums still matter.
Black Lives Matter executives recently released an opinion to answer the question of whether the group should be considered a hate group by Fox News’s TV giant Elisabeth Hasselbeck.
“The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,” the executives said.
It was only recently reported that Damon was involved among the entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
The first American Ninja Warrior Champion to be crowned
Professional professional golfer and bowler Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and won a million-dollar jackpot.
The competition programme, which had been concluded in its seventh term, has never had a competitor who would have survived all the parts of the programme's esterada.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the final round.
The last mission was to climb a rope of about 23 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and figured out the challenge in time, making him the first athlete of all time to figure out the boring 4th part of the American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero figured out the challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview to E!News after a hard-won win and was still in shock at winning the top prize of a million dollars.
“So it’s great to think about this when I’ve never earned or lived as much as $10,000 a year,” Isaac told E! after his big pay raise.
So all of a sudden... I can't even imagine what this is going to be like... the future is unknown.
Production Director Kent Weed sat down to discuss the final with The Hollywood Reporter and why Britten doesn’t get more reward money, even though he’s the first competitor of all time to have managed to cross the line.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
“If more people pass, the money gets the one with the fastest time,” Weed said.
Although money is a great reward and changes life, he still gets a great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels good about it.
He's just so happy that he's got to do what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a good family.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, “If anyone had to beat me, I’m happy that it was Isaac.”
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns for the eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers skip the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season has not been very fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers were once one of the best baseball teams, but are now the last in the American League Central division.
The Tigers played their spoiler role perfectly on Tuesday, when it won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins lost the opportunity to rise to the semi-finals from the Houston Astros in a race from the second wild card spot in the American League.
For Detroit, the game had at least one night to return to the six-letter H-word pair, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the last half of the season.
“All the wins are fun, no matter how they are made,” Tigers team leader Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers feeder Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive support as Detroit made the run three times in the first two innings, and then once in sixth and again in ninth.
Simon (13-9) fed 6 1/3 in pairs and allowed three runs.
This was only his third inning in the last nine games.
“I just want a strong end to this year,” Simon said.
It's hard for an exchange man to feed in every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers pitcher Victor Martinez hit three times and allowed two runs, which were his first runs since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-run night after he hit the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He shook the ground well," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in batting practice), looked much better in batting practice, and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins had three runs left in the last half of the seventh quarter, and it was their best chance to get back into the game.
Sentry Byron Buxton started the turn by hitting the pair twice on the left field line.
On the right, Aaron Hicks returned home with one wash, and Simon was directly burned by Brian Dozier, another wash player, before Simon was replaced by Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player against the incumbent, ahead of the starting pitcher Miguel Sanoa, who threw a two-legged run to the left of the right-hand Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and a runner-up in the second round, VerHagen got a three-pointer Trevor Pluffen to score a double-game lead.
It was the record of the main series: the 27th time this season, when Plouffe scored a double.
After Detroit had received a safety run at the start of the ninth, Mauer kicked two hit runs against Tigers locker Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player burned the Word in three innings in his fifth save.
Detroit initially took advantage of Phil Hughes, who was in the lead.
The Tigers got three runs in the first two innings against a right-wing veteran who got out of the injured list before the game after being out for more than a month due to inflammation.
“It’s obvious that I didn’t want such a start,” Hughes said, “but as the game progressed I felt more comfortable, and I felt like I got to do a few nice feedings on the third pair.”
After Hughes caught the starter's first pitch, he let the second player, Ian Kinsler, advance one by one.
The walk of the right-hand side of J.D. Martinez in the event of two fires brought Victor Martinez to the pitch, who took himself to the first pitch and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 tube while the runners were in good running places.
Three-footer Nick Castellanos continued to hit the right and cause a second run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected as he tried to advance to the third-footer.
The Tigers continued with the second pair of assists and got one shot, two runs from James McCann, and two runs, one run from Anthony Gos, and then 3-0.
“It was an important blow,” said Paul Molitor, Team Leader of the Twins.
He didn't hit very well, but it flew to the right place.
Hughes began to be in feeding classes and fed an inexhaustible third shifter, after which his replacement became the right-hand sequel to A.J. Achter.
Hughes was scored three runs out of six shots and walked on four shots.
ATTENTION: Tigers right-handed feeder Anibal Sanchez was forced out of the game due to shoulder strain.
He is studied by Dr. James Andrews, who cut off Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder injury, but he was due to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed feeder Daniel Norris will be on the injured list to start up against the Twins.
Norway's Tigers are 1-1 in four starts after left-handed pitcher David Price was traded to him on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20th due to a ruptured right ventricle.
Tigers and Twins' three-game series ends on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) stands against Minnesota right-wing feeder Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up the economy to the world
The economy will need to be more open to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group on Tuesday to steer the reform.
"China should commit to attracting foreign funding and expertise and develop a policy of transparency," he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the Group leading the deepening of the reform.
Supporting openness at the same time as reforms are being driven forward will increase new momentum and vitality, as well as create new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of restrictive access to the market, the discovery of border inspection principles, the call for state-owned enterprises to take on private capital, and the revision of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created naming the sectors and companies that cannot be invested in.
The system is gradually being tested and improved with the help of experimental programmes.
The change is significant, as it gives the market a greater role in targeting resources, ensures a law-based business environment and makes the market more open, the opinion states.
The government also finds its control over the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that companies decide for themselves how they handle their business.
The statement also said that China should allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation as well as new mechanisms for the development of regional growth.
In order to open up government-controlled sectors, more sectors will be opened up to private donors.
"The government does not change its policy regarding foreign investment, and it will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, the search process of foreign permanent residence permits, "green cards", is facilitated by optimizing requirements and easing the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the professional exercise rights of lawyers, as well as the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, were reported after the meeting in a statement released.
