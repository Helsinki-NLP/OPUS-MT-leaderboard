Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they will “look like Mupets”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are appalled at the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Welsh Parliament)
The reason for the proposal is the plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said his group is concerned that "it is rhyming with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means beef.
A member for Plaid said the group as a whole was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was approaching a change of name “with an open mind”, but noted that the MWP was close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is now preparing legislation to amend the name, said: "The final decision on how the members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will, of course, be on the members themselves."
The 2017 Law of the Welsh Government gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals, where it received broad support for the option to call a meeting of the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, the commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant gained the most support in the public discussion.
Members of the assembly are apparently proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach a consensus may cause concern for President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a legislative proposal within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes in the functioning of the Assembly, including rules for disqualification of members and a draft committee system.
The members of the Assembly will vote on the issue of their title as part of the debate on the new legislation.
The Macedonian people will vote to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country’s name will be changed to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum is expected to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim to Greek territory, and repeatedly protests against applications for membership of the country in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the plebiscite on changing the name, said he would not be guided by the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, argue, however, that changing the name is simply a price for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's quiet because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival
“The old people I’ve talked to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“There’s no such thing today.”
The disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People are dealing with it in a different way today,” he says.
“Bars are no longer living rooms in the neighborhood where people regularly go.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the property will not be enough as long as their representatives expect, "and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started."
As he adds, the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of this type of people who do not help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood much.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white,” he says, “and therefore the day will come when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that the majority of those people who move into apartments will be white.”
Both churches built white congregations even before Harlem became the black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin’s ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved in the 30s of the 20th century.
The building was taken over by the Black Congregation, whose devotions were held not far away.
St. Martin took over the Black Congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th Street retailers, the main shopping boulevard in Harlem, who refused to employ or raise blacks.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin, proudly called the bells of the poor.
The expert, who played the bell in July, called it "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell choir in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell choir in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says no one replaced him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, a complicated story of architects and builders has taken place at St. Martin’s, some of whom were called laity representatives of the church and others episcopal dioceses.
In July, the Council of Elders – the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay representatives – sent a letter to the diocese expressing concern that the diocese “will try to make an effort to pay the costs” to the council of elders, although the hiring of architects and builders who did not send the dioceses did not.
Some parishioners complained of insufficient transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California who drowned in a lobster
According to the official report, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who drowned in California for hummingbirds on the day of the start of the humming season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help, and then he and the whole group paddled to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that the call was at first considered to be a pleasure from the hunt for humor, but then “you realized you were yelling ‘Kumble me!
He bites me!”
When Hammel got to the boy, he noticed that "he had a broken whole area of the key bone."
“I shouted, let everyone go out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel adds.
The boy was in critical condition transported by helicopter to the Children's Council Hospital in San Diego.
It is not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered a traumatic injury in the upper part of the torso.
Authorities have closed for 48 hours access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks living in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's wants to stand up to the chains of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams cosmetic streets in the style of a business house, where specialized retailers will be available.
As part of a strong entry into the cosmetics market in the UK, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and growing further, while sales of fashion and domestic needs are declining, the streets with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country.
Investing in cosmetics is linked to the supermarket’s effort to find use for shelves that were previously used for television, microwave ovens and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s says it will double the size of the cosmetic product range to 3,000 products and will also introduce brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
More space will also be available from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands thanks to brand sites similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also re-introduces its range of make-up boutiques, so most products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, two stores in Saintsbury’s will test the concessions of the Fragrance Shop perfume retailer. The first such store was opened last week in Croydon in south London and will be established next year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Shopping on the internet and moving towards everyday shopping for a small amount of food in local stores means that supermarkets need to try harder to attract people.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe says that stores will increasingly look like business houses because the supermarket chain is trying to fight off discount retailers like Aldi and Lidl by offering better services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened hundreds of stores in Argos and also introduced a number of Habitat departments, which are chains that he bought two years ago. Thanks to this increased food sales and acquisitions are even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to transform the department with a cosmetic and pharmaceutical assortment ended infamously.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s was testing a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of proceeds from drug sales in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s sold its 281 pharmacies three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, which owns a chain of Lloyds pharmacies.
Lloyds is set to play its role by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Sainsbury’s Chief Executive Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We’ve changed the look and style of cosmetics streets to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues, with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should meet all needs and attractive environments, and the convenient location means that we are now presenting an attractive place to buy cosmetics that is changing old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones is ‘excited’ after Holly Willoughby resigns from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract
Dragons star Den Peter Jones "hurts" after television host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a $11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of homewear and accessories.
The company of this couple was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
Seventy-year-old moderator of the show announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered the Dragons star of the series Den Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute – to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to reported sources, Jones was “hurt” when a television star at a tense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to the new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – he would no longer be able to devote his time to them.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was able to double the wealth of Willoughby's moderator at an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 70-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones took off from Britain to one of his summer residences.
The unnamed source states: “Trula’s brand was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would secure her for decades to come.
Her decision to leave all the participants was absolutely shocking.
No one on Tuesday could believe what was going on, the launch was so close.
At the Marlow headquarters, there is a full stock of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of this morning’s moderators, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to a hefty investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes and possibly another significant downturn at a later date.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tary Capp.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tary Capp in 2016 and twenty-two-year-old Jones joined the board in March.
The couple go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become M&S's ambassador and replace Anta McPartlina as she moderates I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We will not comment on his business.”
It’s hard to say, “And then we fell in love.”
He joked about the criticism he received from journalists for a remark some consider to be “inappropriate to the president” and for how well he speaks about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with his ridiculous “vocal” voice.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that after their June first meeting in Singapore, Trump rated it as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is interested in the next meeting.
But negotiations on the liquidation of nuclear weapons have stalled at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “response” to its first steps to disarmament.
Instead, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
In his speech, Trump expressed a much more optimistic view.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
That would cost millions of lives.
We have a great relationship now.”
His efforts to improve relations with Kim, he said, brought positive results – ending missile tests, helping to free the hostages and returning the rest of the American soldiers to the country.
And he defended his unusual approach to informing about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena outside, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami waves and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs have learned that they are not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok’s population has been expelled from their homes, no national disaster has been declared, which is a necessary prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a bit difficult,” Ms. Sumbang says.
The organization Save the Children brings together a team that travels to Pal, but it is not yet clear whether foreign staff can work here.
The national disaster agency, Mr Sutupo, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paul to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
Since earthquakes occur in Indonesia very often, the country is still sadly unprepared for Mother Nature’s anger.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but in other parts of the coast this is not common at all.
The loss of human lives is likely to have contributed to the apparent lack of sirens alerting Paul to the tsunami, even though the warning was issued.
Even at the best time travel between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in the event of natural disasters, logistics is even more difficult.
The hospital ship, anchored in Lombok and aided by the earthquake victim, is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days for the new calamitous to arrive.
Improving bad Indonesian infrastructure was the main point of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
He will seek re-election next year, but his government is narrowing down funding gaps.
President Joko is also facing pressure from the continuing sectarian tension in Indonesia, when members of the Muslim majority accept a more conservative form of faith.
Street fighting between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, has already claimed the lives of more than a thousand people and tens of thousands of people have fled their homes.
Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool shot a goal-scoring match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute in London's Stamford Bridge on Saturday, saving Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 yards ahead of Chelsea when his team lost 1-0.
He flipped the ball to the left and fired at the far bar.
The gun flew high and headed to the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually crossed the jumping Kep Arrizabalag and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq are always playing as much as possible forward, so I wanted to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kant approaching me, so I didn't think much about it, and I shot one touch."
Chelsea led 1-0 to Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
Assailant Blues sent the belt back to Mate Kovacic, then turned in the middle of the pitch and sprinted to half Liverpool.
The coward quickly played the ball.
Then he sent the ball down a beautiful alley to Hazard to the limelight.
He fled the defence and ended up with the left to a distant pole next to Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
On Wednesday at 15 o’clock Liverpool will compete with the local team in the Champions League group at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play 15 hours on Thursday in London with Videoton in the UEFA European League.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to 832.
As the Indonesian disaster agency reported on Sunday morning, the number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami surged to 832.
The 7.5-degree quake hit Friday, triggered waves as high as 6 meters, and trapped many people in the rubble of collapsed buildings, Sutopo Purwo Nugroh’s office said at a news conference.
The city of Paula, which has over 380,000 inhabitants, was visited by rubble of destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of raping a woman
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and police immediately began an investigation into the murder.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called the people in the area who saw or heard something to report.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan says: “The investigation is just beginning, but I would like to appeal to everyone who has been moving near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras could have recorded something to contact us, because they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that a dead woman was living in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, a group of friends arrived at the scene, who think they know a woman, to ask where she was found in the morning.
Police said the investigation was under way and are now informing the relatives of the victims.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but the police have told him that no one can enter or leave the building.
When he found out what had happened, he couldn’t speak.
Residents have now learned that it will take several hours for them to be able to return home.
One man was told by a police officer that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
He kept saying, “That’s terrible.”
At 14 o'clock, two police supplies were behind the belt and another one was waiting outside.
In the closed area, there are a number of police officers who monitor the house.
Anyone with any information can send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call line 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and enter code 247 from September 30.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has recently become a hit due to the "rewriting of history" controversy
His expulsion would be deserved punishment for the fact that his fanatical puritanical followers in the style of the Taliban destroyed many English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
President of the Cromwell Society John Goldsmith said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character would become one of the targets in front of the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not order or carry out iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Cromwell’s fine-tuning, written by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is proof of the 19th century’s views and part of the historiography of the character, which many believe still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, though today a little less than at the end of the 19th century, to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of an unceasing historical debate.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure who represents one side of this transformation.
His achievements in the role of Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance."
China's Farmer's Pork Kills
According to local media reports, a pig farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on the market in southeastern China.
As the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday, a man with only the surname "Yuan" was found dead in a blood clot near a lung in the market in Liou-pchan-shuej in Kuej-cho province.
The pig farmer is preparing to apply the vaccine to pigs in the city of Si-ning, China, on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly came on Wednesday with a cousin from the neighboring province of J<0xC3><0xBC>n-nan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to the next armpit was open.
According to him, there was a large pig in the snout with a snout of blood.
According to the information, during the forensic examination, it was confirmed that 250 kilograms of pork was torn apart by the farmer.
“The brat had legs all bloody and broken,” the Guiyang Evening News fraternity newspaper quoted him as calling it “Wu.”
The security camera footage shows Yuan coming to the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousins.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was closed so that no one else would think when police gathered evidence at the scene of the crime.
Market officials are reportedly negotiating with Yuan's family about compensation for his death.
Pork attacks on humans are rare, but they have already occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man critically injured.
Ten years earlier, 300kg of pig was attached to the tractor by a Welsh farmer and taken away by the farmer's wife.
After a 2012 Oregon farmer ate his pig, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “smoke.”
"They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them a lot of respect," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa Will Bring Heavy Rain to the Southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken and move over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, flooding will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5 a.m. Eastern time, Rosa reached a wind speed of 137 km/h, which is a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southeast of the city of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure gully forms over the Pacific Ocean and moves east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will be in the form of a tropical storm and begin to push tropical moisture north into the southwestern part of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
The tropical humidity with the approaching low-pressure dam in the following days will cause heavy rain in the southwestern United States.
Locally, between 25 and 100 mm of precipitation can cause dangerous flooding, tidal currents, and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause the precipitation to reach 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwestern United States, especially over most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
In rapidly deteriorating conditions, tidal flooding may occur due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain. <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2> <0xE2><0x80><0xA2>
Due to the danger of tropical storms, it would be very unwise to walk into the desert.
Heavy rain can cause the canyons to become a raging river, and storms will bring local storms and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure dam will bring strong local rainfall on some parts of the coast of southern California.
There may be total precipitation above 13 mm, which could lead to smaller flows of sutins and sluices.
This will be the first rainfall in the region.
On Sunday evening and on Monday morning, unique tropical overhangs will begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday evening and Tuesday rain will spread.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to Four Corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense changes in temperature across the U.S. as the Arctic begins to cool, but in the tropical zone there will still be quite a bit of heat.
This sometimes leads to rapid changes in temperature over short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the US on Sunday.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, he will try again to extend the dozing summer heat.
In most areas of the central and eastern United States, the warm beginning of October is expected to be around 27 <0xC2><0xB0>C from the southern plains to the northeastern part of the United States.
In New York City it could be 27 <0xC2><0xB0>C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of over-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's hearing followed more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels Thursday's rousing statement by the Supreme Court justices Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political meltdown continued, and voters were interrupting regular programs with reports of a sudden Friday turnaround: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure Kavanaugh was teasing her at a high school party and trying to dress her up.
Kavanaugh, in his excited statement, said he was 100% sure he didn't.
It is likely that the event was watched by more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen.
The company calculated average follow-up on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The numbers for the other stations that broadcast the announcements, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look in the offices.
For comparison, it is a similar number of spectators who watch football matches in play-off or Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the biggest following of all stations when, according to Nielsen, it was watched by an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing.
The second was the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reports that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest continued even after the end of the negotiations.
The main character of the Friday drama was Senator Flake.
After this moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning captured how protesters shouted at him as he was about to go to a court hearing.
CNN was broadcast live as he stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes and let himself be fed.
One woman said, "I'll stand right in front of you."
“Do you think the country is telling the truth?”
He also heard, “You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and even before closing the elevator door, he added that he would say more about the commission's negotiations.
All cable and television networks later broadcast live when the court committee was to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the charges against the candidate are investigated by the FBI next week, which was demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partially convinced by the interviews with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's vote was important because it was clear that without an investigation, Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges brought against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of Brexit "politicians"
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "politicians" about Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview that was close to that with the prime minister on the title page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said that the proposal for Britain and the EU to pick up their tariffs on each other was “absolutely meaningless.”
Waydea Sims shooting: Police arrest Dytheon Simpson, who is suspected of LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge police department said Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the match.
According to the WABF channel, which belongs to CBS, the police secured the glasses at the scene of the crime and found Simpson's DNA on them.
Simpson told police after the hearing that Wayde had been shot.
According to the lawyer, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge coroner’s office released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The department is grateful to the Louisiana State Refugee Police Unit, the State Police Crime Labs, the Southern University Police Department, and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local police for “drinking and striving for justice.”
The Sims were 20 years old.
The two-meter-long assailant grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that Wayde’s death was “shocked” by the team and “shocked” him.
"That's what you're still afraid of," Wade said.
The ashtray of Mexico City
The ash flowing from the Popacatépetl volcano hit the southern quarter of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after the volcanic activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was followed by a series of upheavals and shocks.
On social media, images of car front glass covered with a thin layer of ash appeared in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 72 kilometres (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017 and had a force of 7.1 degrees.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
On the eve of the independence vote, the police clashed with Catalan separatists.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after protesters clashed with the police for independence and thousands of people took part in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the independence vote that divided Catalonia.
Regular police officers blocked a group of masked separatists, who threw eggs and powder paint after them. Those on the streets, which are usually flooded tourists, created dark clouds of dust.
Later, there were also clashes, to which the police had to use the shoes.
The independence-supporting groups chanted “We will not forget, we will not forgive” in the face of the protesting supporters of the union, who shouted “Let Spain live”.
According to local media, 14 people were slightly injured in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but the separatist Catalans celebrate it, tensions in the region seeking independence remain high.
The majority of voters voted for independence, but the turnout in the elections was low because opponents of the split boycotted them.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police in violent clashes across the region tried to end the vote in polling stations.
The independence-supporting groups stayed outside Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to choose a different route.
Eighty-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who was involved with the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes to gain independence for Catalonia.
“Last year we had some of the best moments.
My parents were crying with joy that they could vote, but now we’re on a blind alley,” he said.
Despite the important, even though the close victory in the regional elections last December of the Catalan party supporting independence had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their most famous leaders either did not go to exile themselves, or were waiting for a referendum to be held.
Twenty-two-year-old Monter Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone, saying the conflict had resonated with politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting tougher,” he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"The candidacy in the European elections is the best way to condemn the fall in democratic values and repression that we witness from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men jailed after car crash home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, someone may have fired a shot at the car.
Meng's match gave Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Mengy's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Livingston, who advanced from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard only the second defeat of 18 games as the manager of the club from Ibrox.
Tref Dolly Mengy proved decisive when Gary Holt's team reached Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not yet won the Premiership this season on the guest pitch and next Sunday will be the first Hearts to lose eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston expanded a number of unbeaten games into the six-match division, so head coach Holt, who knocked out Kenny Miller last month, has not yet attempted a defeat.
Livingston didn't take a chance against uninvited guests
Holt's team was to lead long before the goal, as his directness caused Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defence, but failed to get through the gate, then Alan Lithgow in the slide just passed Craig Halkett's head in front of the gate.
It was enough for the locals to watch the Rangers play in front of them, because they knew they could torture the guests with standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
A free kick was ordered against the Rangers and Livingston created a bowl, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together sent Meng, who ran and scored the ball in the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated the ball, but the home defense was impenetrable to them, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly did not have much work.
The same image of the game was in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman stopped the legs of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow did not fall out of Livingston's other standard situation.
In the penalty area of Livingston, there were two penalty kicks, one after Halkett's attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and the other at hand.
"The Phenomenon" from Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Fantastic performance and result for Livingston.
They were, without exception, excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and manhood have hardly changed since returning to the top, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for how the team has erupted since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, led by a brilliantly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on guard all the time.
The Rangers are not inspired.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they no longer meet these standards.
Their end was poor – they only penetrated the home page once – and for Rangers it should be a wake-up call because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met on Saturday (September 29th) for breakfast in Berlin, the sky was blue and everyone was smiling.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed over a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police for security reasons prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but there were many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people, many of whom were Kurds, were also heard protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
Contradictory protests reflect the controversy of a visitor, whom some German Turks celebrated as a hero, and others cursed as an autocrat.
Deptford accident: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died after being hit by a car.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street with busy Evelyn Street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and soon the ambulance arrived, but the man was dead on the spot.
It was only a few months after another cyclist died about a kilometre and a half from the scene of the Saturday tragedy in an accident on Childers Street, when the driver from the scene was caught.
The Metropolitan Police said police are now trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The roads are closed, buses run along alternate routes and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six inmates were injured in riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured during the riots in a high-security male prison.
The riots broke out in the Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 a.m. local time and are still ongoing.
In order to cope with the fragility, which involved eight prisoners in one wing, specialized supervisors from the "Torn<0xC3><0xA1>do" team were called.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “In order to deal with the ongoing incident in the Long Lartin prison, special training of prison workers was put in place.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend more time behind bars.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was announced that the director of the prison had ended after an attack on a prisoner in the hospital.
And last October, regular units were called to prison because of serious unrest, during which personnel were attacked by bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens the waters of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (the area where it is dry may benefit)
It’s not uncommon for Arizona to be hit by a tropical low-pressure gust, but that’s what’s likely to happen early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the desert southwest and brings the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of flooding on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to make a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday evening.
According to the National Weather Service, “Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have retained the status of a tropical storm or pressure below, within a distance of 320 km from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane another 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitations of 50 to 100 mm, in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Pan, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local peaks up to 100 mm.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the Rosy rain can be a blessing, because the area has been hit dry.
Floods are a very serious thing, but they may help somewhere, because the southwestern United States has just been hit by a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, server weather.com reports that more than 40% of Arizona experiences at least “extreme drought,” which is the second-highest category.
The road to Hurricane Rosa will first take you to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane power with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 19 km/h north.
Then the storm meets the colder waters of the Pacific, and therefore loses its strength.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, collisions will be strong, which poses a high risk of flooding.
“In the area from Baja California to Northwest Sonor we expect a total of 75 to 150 mm of precipitation, which can occur up to 250 mm,” the weather.com server said in a statement.
Rosa then travels as a tropical storm through Mexico to the north and on Tuesday mornings she arrives at the Arizona border, then passes through Arizona and on Tuesday late at night she enters southern Utah.
“The main risk for Rosa or her remains is expected to be a very severe collision in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will cause deadly tidal floods and torrents of rain in the deserts and droughts of land in the mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
A three-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a stabbed 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 a.m. local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
As reported by police from Avon and Somerset, young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained in the Radstock area at night.
Police are looking for witnesses who might have a record of what happened on their cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'tried innocence and anger' Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the reckless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh during his nomination process "tried to be ruthless and angry" by the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh spoke before Congress on Thursday, where he resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's claim that she was sexually assaulted a few decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also spoke at the hearing on her accusation.
The president said on Saturday that on that day “the Americans were witnesses to Kavanaugh’s brilliance and quality and courage.”
A spokesperson for his West Virginia supporters said that “the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the greatest legal minds of our time, a lawyer who has excellent public service on his account.”
The president indirectly hit Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about how important it is for Republicans to participate in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks ago was one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm still on the move," he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said the Democrats had opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
The Republican Party's leadership adviser told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination on the Senate floor is expected no later than Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of victims continues to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, at least 384 people died, many of them littered with huge waves that flooded the beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered at the festival on Friday at the beach in Palu. However, after dark, up to six-meter waves hit the coast, which many people killed and destroyed everything that cost them in the way.
The tsunami was preceded by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
"When a tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people continued to engage in activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they fell victim to the waves," said a spokesman for the Indonesian Agency for the Mitigation of the BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroh earthquake at a newsstand in Jatifinkar.
“The tsunami wave didn’t go alone, it took cars, cottages, houses, it hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that before the attack on the coast, the tsunami wave spread at an open sea speed of 800 km/h.
He said that some people fled to the trees before the wave and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Pal.
The aerial photographs published by the cemetery relief agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The consequences were felt by the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technologies (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s powerful shakes was about 200 times greater than the force of the atomic bomb dropped during World War II in Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of long, narrow bays, which could have increased the tsunami wave even further.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found mutilated under the rubble of collapsed buildings, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of casualties and damage may be greater on the coast 300 km north of Pal, in an area called Donggala, which is close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to him, the communication was "completely compromised without any information" from the Donggala.
The Red Cross said in its statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, and added that its workers and volunteers are targeting the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," the statement said.
The agency received considerable criticism on Saturday for not informing Pal that the wave had hit the tsunami, although authorities said the waves had come at the time the warning was issued.
On the amateur videos shared on social media, it is heard how a man on the upper floor of the building desperately warns people on the street from approaching a tsunami.
Within a few minutes the coast will hit the water wall, which will take away buildings and cars.
The Reuters agency was not able to verify the record immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunami waves caused a large outage of electricity, which disrupted communications around Pal, so the authorities could barely coordinate rescue work.
According to the army authorities, she began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated people still need food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city was reopened only for transportation assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the evacuation centers in Pal on Saturday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision staff from Donggala came to the city of Paula, where employees hid in shelters from tents built on the courtyard of the office building, they saw images of destruction along the way, says Mr. Doseb.
“They said they saw a lot of destroyed homes,” he adds.
It's too bad.
When the aid groups started a sad activity to help with disasters, some of them complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can begin to flow to the place of the calamitous until the national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Indonesian Red Cross spokesman Aulia Arriani.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international aid, but this is not the case.”
When Paul was born the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those who are still unknown still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that alleviate the gloomy stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they pulled a little boy out of the canal.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been imprisoned for two days under the care of her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders at the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia this month.
Another of the people who were imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a person who has been dealing with paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Gendon explained how, in the hours that followed, after the paragliding community learned about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to competitors from Pal, who attended the beach festival.
But instead of the two blue markings, his messages ended with a gray mark.
“I think that means the news wasn’t delivered,” he says.
Thieves Take $26,750 While Complementing a Newport ATM on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, the thief on Friday morning kidnapped $26,750 of Brink’s staff while completing a Newport on the Levee ATM.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deposit more money into it.
When he did, another man “runs out of the Brink employee” and steals a bag of money that was to be deposited in the ATM.
Witnesses said they saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
If you have any information about the identity of the suspects, please contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The change was announced on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: “Being formally known as Kanye West.”
The forty-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the pseudonyms as the name of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on the Saturday Night Live show, where he is scheduled to release his new album Yandhi.
The show will replace singer Arianu Grande, who canceled her participation for “sensitive reasons,” as the show’s creator said.
West has previously said that the word for him has, in addition to shortening the existing professional name and religious significance.
"In my opinion, 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, where 'you' means 'you'," West said at the beginning of this year when he spoke about his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us, it’s us.
It changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are."
The name has also been changed by a number of other famous rappers.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he prefers the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
West's former co-worker JAY-Z also alternately wrote his name with an ally and without him and large and small letters.
Mexican President Amlo has promised he will not use the army against civilians.
On the occasion of the approaching 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students, the newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
At a time when the leftist student movement was spreading throughout Latin America, on October 2, 1968, soldiers began shooting at people at a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those who study, and by opening other free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education draw young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Funding for Artificial Intelligence
According to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and the U.S. should double the amount they spend on research in the field.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government released a notice about AI, although the U.S. as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, meanwhile, launched a plan last year that it wants to be the first AI innovation leader by 2030.
“A doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are far beyond the U.S. and we’re looking for another breakthrough in AI,” Lee says.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling funding could double the chance that the next major AI discovery will be made in the U.S.
Lee, who has published his book “The Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face+.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that outperformed the best American player in the game Othello, and later was the head of Microsoft’s research and president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee appreciated the previous U.S. government’s technological competition, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotic Challenge, and asked when the next one would help identify new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“Academic excellence is not driven by China, but by corporations,” Lee says.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been employing the best experts from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, the United States could also help with changes in immigration policy to improve AI efforts.
“In my opinion, PhD holders in the field of AI should be automatically offered green cards,” he says.
China’s State Council issued a New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides finance to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Science Council and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the U.S., but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee says.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is now investing more than $100 million per year in AI research.
However, the U.S. legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not done anything for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether they want to change the name of the country
People from Macedonia on Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which blocks applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and therefore vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents suggest that the change will weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slovak population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for a boycott raised doubts as to whether he would deliver at least 50 percent of the necessary votes to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: “Are you for NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that it is the price it is worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says Oliver Georgievska, 79, of Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but a number of members of parliament have said they will be guided by the result of the vote.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said no problems had been reported within 13 hours.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent versus 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters turned their votes in the end.
“I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko are voting in a Macedonian referendum on a name change that would open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small podium and pulls out the chairs in front of the stands built by people boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with a head raised, not a door for service,” Kavadarkov says.
“We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%, so much needed investment.
“I think the vast majority will be for, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after voting.
The result of “yes” would be “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, the referendum could take place between 30 and 43 percent of voters – which is less than the required turnout.
In another survey conducted by Macedonian TV station Telma TV, it was found that 57% of the respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50 percent plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western government’s policy since its inception in May.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City came to the goal through the whole defence of Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made Brighton's defence on Saturday, securing Manchester City a 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguera's goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
It all started with the recording that the Argentinian attacker received in the middle of the field.
He sprinted between the three Brighton defenders and got into the open space.
Aguera was surrounded by four green jerseys.
On the edge of Brighton's penalty area, one defender walked around and several others ran past him.
The next recording on the left found Sterling.
The English striker hit the ball in the penalty area back to Aguero, who right-handedly beat Brighton defender Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the net.
“Aguero has a problem with his feet,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We thought he was going to play 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky to have scored at that point.”
The initial advantage for the Sky Blues in this Premier League match was set by Sterling.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane on his left.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to a distant bar.
The Sky Blues striker put the ball into the net just before slipping out of the field.
City will play on Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to destroy the joy of the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the fight for play-offs, there were not many reasons to perform again.
But eternally competitive Scherzer hopes that Sunday he will stand in the place of the forward in a game against the Colorado Rockies – but only if the Rockies, who lead the NL West in one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, hope to play-off.
On Friday evening, the Rockies secured at least a wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but they still want to win their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, we can at least start because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play with probably the most effort I’m going to experience this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play in that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are reportedly preparing to take Scherzer’s lead in such a situation.
For Scherzer, it would be the 34th start, he would train on Thursday and play on Sunday, when he's usually free.
Washington's right-wing forward this season has 18-7 statistics with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump Attends Assembly in West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The president spoke indirectly about the situation around his candidate for the Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about how important it is for Republicans to participate in the midterm elections.
“In November, everything we’ve been able to do will be at stake.
There are five weeks left in one of the most important elections of our lives.
It’s one of the big, big ones – I don’t run, but we’re still on the move and I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see this is happening right now.
And they are determined to take power by any means necessary, you see this vanity, resistance.
They don't care who's hurt, who's overruled to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give them that."
According to him, the Democrats decided to "resist and obstruct".
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he added, saying that the Democrats are “angry and evil and resilient and profanity.”
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud applause of the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get that document?
Uh, what?
No, no, wait — it was a really bad body language — the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse stream of views.
It is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When activists from Momenta on my local side voted for my remark, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs who have said they are not welcome – because they have honestly said their opinion.
They treated my colleague in Parliament Joan Ryan in a similar way because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized in the remark that I disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on paradoxically similar issues, on which Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Friday meeting of the Labour Party in Nottingham East, it was written that “we want the meetings to be accessible and productive.”
Most of the eight years I was a local member of parliament for the Labour Party were exactly the same as the GC meeting on Friday evening.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings do not take place today, and the promise of a “better, gentler” policy has long since been forgotten if it ever began with him.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the Party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader. Colleagues, whom I previously thought we had similar political views, suddenly expected me to turn 180<0xC2><0xB0> and stand in positions that I could not otherwise agree with – whether it was a matter of unity without a nation.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – then there’s a bunch of social media posts calling for my appeal, condemning Wednesday’s politics and telling me I shouldn’t be on the Labour side.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but will never give up.
One of the aspects of this era of politics that I am most disappointed with is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer that diverse stream of opinions and with every proposal to express distrust or change the rules of selection, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years I have been advised many times to stay back, not to call so much and then “I’ll be fine.”
But that's not what I went into politics for.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student of the school, fueled by the government’s incompetence of Margaret Thatcher, who literally let my class of general schools fall apart, I’ve tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most – or need them most.
I never hid my politics, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas where I do not agree with the current leadership.
To those who backed the proposal on Friday, I would only say that if the country infiltrates Brexit, which harms households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
My main message, however, is not addressed to the Moment in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats of appeal or political pragmatism will prevent me from eating them.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
The two late fives slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly fun match Tennent's Premiership.
Now they're at the top of the table, like the only undefeated.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and better use of the odds, which helped the home team win, and coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be satisfied.
“In our games we have gone through great trials and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “All honour to Ayra, they took a chance better than we did.”
The five Grant Andersons in the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climb, sent Ayr forward, but the yellow card for the Scottish representative Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot won invariably.
Climo increased Ayr's lead by a penalty and then scored and turned the solo attempt in exactly half time, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and five Patrick Andersons, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then followed a longer delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridha Knott, who left the field on the stretchers, and when he began to play again, Ayr jumped again thanks to five McDowall's Staffords, which Climo transformed.
Ayr's captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and Melrose again used the player thanks to the unaltered five Bruce Colvin after a short strong pressure.
However, the home came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given yellow for attacking Clima without the ball, MacPherson from the penalty range placed the ball behind the advancing maul of Ayru.
Climo changed, again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's spear and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth home run.
Still Game star embarks on a new career in hospitality
The star of the Still Game series Ford Kieran seems to be moving into the hospitality industry. It turned out that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
Sixteen-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and plays alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the final series of the series, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to an excerpt from the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper suggested that Kiernan wanted to engage in a “prosperous restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines are watching the naval command in La Paz, which is decorated with lanyards.
Above the public buildings there is a blue flag in the color of the ocean.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described with the slogan: “The sea is our right.
It is our duty to get it.”
Inland Bolivia, there is still a vivid memory of the coast that the country lost in favor of Chile in the bloody war on resources in the 19th century – as well as the desire to re-absorb the Pacific Ocean.
These desires are perhaps the greatest in a few decades, as Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice, which should fall on October 1 after five years of service.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and peace and of course expects a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the MSD on large screens across the country in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of the Bolivian claim that – after decades of intermittent talks – Chile is obliged to act on the fact that Bolivia will be given access.
Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president Evo Morales, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, is also very interested in Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts think that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, much would not change.
This UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to harm any Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that MSD’s decision comes just six months after the latest arguments have come to light shows that the case was “not complex,” says Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, Chile’s expert on international law.
And the last four years have not only not supported the Bolivian cause, but perhaps rather stopped it.
“The issues of access to the sea have been strengthened by the current Bolivian government,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate says.
He adds that Morales’s offensive rhetoric weakened all of Chile’s remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will once again begin to act, but after this it will be extremely difficult to hold a discussion.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement with each other's benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, would use the question of the sea as a political bell.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless the U.S. can’t believe it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never arm its nuclear weapons first if it can’t trust Washington
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the summit of leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy, which has been stuck at a dead end for more than three months for a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says there is a “planning of hope” that ongoing sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration ending the Korean War could sometimes hit the North on its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration if Pjongjang does not take significant steps to disarm at first.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is general skepticism that Pjongjang seriously thinks he will give up this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit of Kim-Trump.
Parisian shows show that the latest trend of huge head coverings will soon arrive in your fashion stores
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of huge head coverings for their spring/summer 2019 collection on a show that captured them all at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats this summer flooded Instagram and these designers sent their exciting creations to the pier.
An exhibition piece from Valentina was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide edge resembling a feather that flooded the heads of the model.
Other excessively large supplements were decorated melons, a witch hat and even pineapple – but they are not meant to warm the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the multicolored masks have protected lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One creature resembled diving equipment with snorkels and glasses, while the other looked like a cornucopia with melted ice cream.
And if you continue with a huge fashion – you’re lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could even get into fashion stores.
The overgrown hats come after "La Bomba", a straw with a half-metre-wide crematorium worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A cult brand behind this very impractical hat that flooded social media sent another huge creation – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model in the swimsuits that carry it to the viewing pole.
The dark orange raffia bag embossed with raffia braids and crafted with white leather handles was an exhibition piece of the La Riviera spring/summer 2019 collection by Jacquemuse at Paris Fashion Week.
Famed designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores next summer – given the designer’s success with them, it would be hard to ignore the hype.”
John Edward: Language skills are a must for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have a number of academic successes behind them and it continues in 2018 with other excellent test results. Individual and group successes in sports, arts, music and other community activities only underline this.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) represents the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (Scotland) and strives to provide the best level of service to its students and parents.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individually tailored school education plans, we observe that modern languages are still popular and sought-after subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes straight to his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart.”
It is an important point of view that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely solely on English.
The latest results of this year’s tests show that languages are at the top of the charts, with the highest success rates being offered by independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language achieved the best grades of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that the highest mark A reached 72 percent of students of Mandarin, 72 percent of students of German, 69 percent of students of French and 63 percent of students of Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subjects that students choose are equally valued as STEM subjects (science, technology, technical fields and mathematics) in the study plans of independent and other schools.
A survey conducted by the British Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that, for reasons that employers cite as problems when occupying vacancies, 17 per cent of the workforce is under-represented in language skills.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more job opportunities require languages, these skills are a necessity in the globalized world.
Whether a man chooses any career, if he has learned a second language, he will have the real advantage in the future, that he has such lifelong skills.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who speaks multiple languages automatically gains an advantage over competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to lead a conversation, with the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, 15 percent being French.
That is why it is important for today’s children to invest in language teaching.
If children know more languages, especially those of developing economies, they will have a greater chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school is different from the language it teaches.
Many schools focus on more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be most important for the UK in the outlook for 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whether the child is interested in anything, he will always have in independent schools a choice of several languages with teachers who are experts in the given field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for them.
At this point, it cannot be denied that languages are essential in the global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should, in fact, be regarded as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, variety and attraction to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will perform for the Lakers for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans looking forward to LeBron James’ first appearance at the Los Angeles Lakers will be looking forward to it soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in Sunday's pre-season opening game in San Diego against the Denver Nuggets.
It is not yet clear how many minutes it will take.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James is likely to spend only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after training, Jamese was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the preseason.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games,” he said.
Trump's speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, will begin a wave of campaigning tonight.
It’s the first of five scheduled matches next week, including stops at friendly venues such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Because of the suspension of the vote on his candidacy for a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to get support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans stand in the November election before the risk of losing Congress.
What time does Trump’s performance start tonight and how can you watch him online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern Time, today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s rally in West Virginia can be watched online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about hearing a candidate in the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court, which took place this week and was very tense over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. The Senate confirmation vote is expected to be postponed by a week before the FBI expires.
But the main goal of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum ahead of the November elections.
According to Reuters, the organizers of President Trump’s campaign say that these five meetings next week are aimed at “adding energy to volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and Senate.”
“Control over the Senate is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible this busy season,” a spokesman for the Trump campaign told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could come to the rally today at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and watch it from the Pittsburgh media.
This will be the second time on Saturday in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, where he earned more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is left behind in the polls.
“For Morrissey, it’s not a good sign that the president needs to come in to help him in his investigations,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team has a stomach to fight to keep hope ahead of Sunday singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday’s doubles could be just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing is a completely invented sports concept, but the players really believe it, and most of all, in such competitions.
So where's the swing going to go now?
"They took six points and now they're four, so we're taking it so the swing is probably moving a little towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, leads by four points and there are still twelve.
As Spieth says, Americans feel that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the shape of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly when moving from the firing range to the green, and he's an example.
The famous screams further intensified in the continuation of his wheel, when he managed the key pad to win the whole match when they were with Thomas after two pits behind.
His putt, which won them a 15-hole game, met with a similar roar that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That’s all that each of these players has left.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undisputedly the main story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but adorable couples from Europe are four out of four and can't prove anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit the pit on Saturday afternoon, but passed on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning."
The course and the way in which energy flows both towards a stormy audience, so from him confirms that these are players destined for Sunday’s victory, and that in the west of the sun over Le Golf National there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Best of both at the same time on a different hole.
Talks about European fame, however, remain premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball morning game when he was paired with Alex Norene.
The pit and two pits on the front nine buried Spain and Sweden in a pit from which they no longer escaped.
No one will help you on Sunday.
Two-to-two-ball games are so fascinating when you closely follow the interaction of people in a couple, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way in which the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and to the last day has attracted a significant jump, but this two-way game has also shown that the U.S. team has a fighting stomach that some, especially from states, have doubted.
By the final day Ryder Cup leads Europe with a score of 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy advantage until the last day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's two-ball doubles with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired by the duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who reportedly won almost twice over the struggling Tiger Woods, they decided to make four shots at Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to retain the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated in the morning games with two balls with the American side, which failed in the series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four games, won two games, but could not get into the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points behind him, while he and Molinari, who after a sensational weekend nicknamed "Molliwood", are only the second pair to win four points from their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a two-ball game, they beat tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more emphatically 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 games in a two-ball doubles game and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after a two-ball morning game, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in a 2&1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – world-class singles and triples.
However, Europe did not have it on this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris won on the whole line.
Three-time main winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a doubles game, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returns from a four-point deficit to a two-hour one, although as the defending Furyk side only needs a draw to win the trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems that Sunday is the counterattack behind them.
North Korea says it will not “under no circumstances” defend itself unilaterally and without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that continued U.N. sanctions have deepened their distrust of the United States, and under such circumstances the country will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual rally that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons.
“But we don’t see a corresponding reaction from the US,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible to unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “progressive” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every step of the way, his statement appeared to be a significant bulwark in the denunciation of the denunciation.
Ri referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”, while Mr. Trump stepped down.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also rejected calls for the release of tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure on sanctions to push its targets, and even push against the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that continued sanctions are deepening our distrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the U.N. earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea were to be on the side of this issue of denuclearization and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would be in such a bad situation.”
However, the tone of Rih’s speech was dramatically different from last year’s when he told a U.N. rally that North Korea’s missile focus on U.S. territory is inevitable after Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the U.N., Trump, who threatened last year with “total destruction” of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still needs to be done and sanctions must remain in place until the end of the war.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue to be disruptive and unstoppable until we become aware of complete, final, verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to curb the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo and Ri met at a U.N. General Assembly, and Pompeo said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip has not ended well.
He left Pyongyang in July and declared that progress had been made, only to have North Korea declare that it had raised “gangster demands” within a few hours.
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim had told him that the “relevant measures” he hoped were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take part in a course that is meant to teach them enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has forced all of its students to sleep more, in an effort to fight the growing culture of macho studies all night long, when students don’t sleep and are encouraged to take caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world’s most famous university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and a female hospital thought to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he lectured about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this right now, in my last year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students the basic information about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s medical services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were really sleepy during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part is an image of student colleges, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, tennis and books about the effects of caffeine and light and on how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, death, depression, and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
However, we think they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “studying all night” still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that the problem of lack of sleep is also growing.
Enough good quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” for combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even so that it does not lead to seizures, because sleep deprivation turns the brain into a hunger mode, so the person is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler propose a course that she completed during her first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the entire course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor advised students to consider setting the alarm for when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can judge your circadian rhythm by what you know.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's Men's Goal
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengy determined Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
The Ibrox side tried to record their first victory from 4 to 1 February of the St Johnstone triumph, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points from the leading Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts leaders.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers seemed uninspired and determined to settle.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is down to third and immediately behind the Hibernian team as opposed to one goal.
And there could be other Rangers problems after the line judge Calum Spence had to be treated with a head injury after apparently hitting the object from the point of view.
Gerrard made eight changes to his side, which moved around Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who picked up the Hearts point last week and would be delighted to have his well-trained men suffocate their opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have mastered the hold, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were supposed to score just two minutes after the start, when Menga first left Scott Pittman at Allan McGregor's gate, but the backup buried his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' distant free-kick was then found by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only try at the rear.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have a quarter-hour penalty when they met with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian challenge from the table.
The Rangers managed only two shots to the target in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was surprised by the header from Lassana Coulibaly and the short shot by Ovie Ejaria.
While Livy’s opening after 34 minutes may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the drill already.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' deep set.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and got Meng to an easy finish.
Gerrard took action during the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had an almost immediate result when the wing crashed into Morelos, but the imposing Kelly fought off the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to the game exactly the kind they like, when Lithgow and Halkett metal one long ball after another.
Holt's side may have deepened its momentum in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim when he got in trouble with Jacobs, but Thomson turned back.
Almanach: Inventor of Geiger's Computers
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years, and it is still growing... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger Counter’s science capital then also became a constant pop culture, as in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado”, starring the seemingly improbable scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can really hear the effects of atoms radiated by radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: "Well, now it really sucks!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” dangerous cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation into a laboratory
Then they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers, and then use a re-injection.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells, missed ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation into a laboratory, so they can "see" proteins common to many cancers called HER2 and then be re-applied to the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “guides the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were removed from patients and "learned" to focus on cancer cells, was already being promoted in the treatment of leukemia type.
Kanye West took part in the pro-Trump sermon, in his magic hat, after his performance at the SNL.
It didn't go too well
Kanye West was screened in Saturday Night Live after a confused performance, during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great Again cap, he began swimming on the Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump, because he’s a racist?’
“If I was a racist, I wouldn’t be in America long ago,” he said.
The SNL began a parody show with Matte Damon in which a Hollywood star was joking about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the Prosecution of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's theatrical speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make West laugh.
West also complained to the audience that he had a nice meal in the back of his head.
“I was bullied in the back.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat."
That's chic!
They also said I was in the wrong place,” the Washington Examiner reported.
West continued, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and added that he would "put on his Superman suit because it means you can't say what I'm supposed to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
"Try love."
His comments only served to smother the audience at least twice, and SNL members looked aggrieved, in disarray, Variety says, and one person even said, "The whole studio was completely quiet."
They invited West as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
West confused many present by singing the song I Love dressed as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from TPUSA’s leading conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the boldest characters: THANK YOU, YOU HAVE BEEN A GIRL.”
But guest talk show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West “just was who he is, and that’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I don’t want to reward someone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his ‘art’), whom I believe he represents and sends into the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accusations of attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was killed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.

The defendant was due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges brought shall be reviewed by the State Representative.
Game Thrones star Kit Harington has let himself into toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in the violent medieval fantasy HBO series.
The actor, 31, however, stepped out of the male hero's stereotype and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be assertive in order to earn respect.
The Sunday Times Culture Kit said he believed “something is wrong” and wondered how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Star of the Rose Leslie Throne star, also 31, admitted that he was “quite strongly” expressing himself to the problem.
"At this moment I feel personally, quite strongly - what's wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach teenage men about the problem we see here now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic manhood thanks to its very male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is taught?
What do boys learn on television, on the streets, from them grows the feeling that it is necessary for every man to have such a page?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time - how to change it?
Because the young men must have changed into something worse.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not play in any prequel or sequel to the Game of Thrones after the series was over, as he already has enough "fights and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play Sam Shepard in the restored Right West, which is the story of the film producer and his brother, the puppeteer.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife Rose for the best of what came out of the Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife while filming the show, so she gave me my future family and my whole next life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this fantasy series awarded the Emmy Award.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people every year.
Transmitting HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged a universal approach to treating HIV as part of an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies letting staff escape GOP senators' data, coining the terms "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned the claim that a member of her staff had sent the personal data of three Republican U.S. senators to the lawmakers' wiki pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were backed by “ultra-right” scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies and other reprehensible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on charges of sexual abuse by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after three senators interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address, which is a source of contributions, is linked to the Waters office and has published information about members of Waters staff, Hill says.
“This unfounded claim is a completely untrue and absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations – was under no circumstances responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely untrue and absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly earned online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is outraged," Fleischer wrote.
“It means he has no temperament to be a member of Congress.”
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he must not get angry.
He can't be stubborn.
He must not question the motives of the plaintiff.
He has to be calm and not get excited.”
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during a Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who participated in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it was true, it would be something,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had alerted “the relevant authorities and authorities involved in criminal proceedings to these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff.”
Johnny English re-interviews reviews – weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new film with a British trend, which seems to be the case for this resurgence of Johnny English in a series of action parodies - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny Re English Bor.
Will this nasty satire on the subject of how obviously bad a nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this quirky, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to repack things in a whole new way - that name more than any other signal that it's a broad comic book intended for English-speaking cinematographers.
He is, of course, the dumb secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean and a big piece of that guy who has lit a single tone in the sound of the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Celebration Game Launch.
The character is also originally based on a traveler and an international mystery man, whom Atkinson once played in the already forgotten television commercials of Barclaycard, and who left behind chaos.
In this latest edition, one or two beautiful moments are found.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in a medieval armor and the blades of the rotor briefly swirled about his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is exposed, but humor feels quite under-sized and strangely superfluous, especially when “serious” film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like children than adults, and for me Johnny Englishe's crazy trampolines are as inventive and focused as Atkinson's silent film gags in the person of Mr. Bean.
The constant current assumption is that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the terror of an agent in the service – up to a very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for the prime minister, who is a pompous and enthusiastic character who is already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays the character of Theresa May as best she can, but there is nothing much in the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that as soon as every active spy of hers is threatened, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director at some luxury facility, but at the same time teaches record-breaking lessons about how to be a secret agent: here are a few nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to the Rock School.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his former long-suffering partner Bough, who was once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with a submarine commander, an affected character who may be a bit worn out with Vicki Pepperdine's talent.
So Batman and Robin are back in action in the secret services package for Her Majesty's Secret Service and meet with the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the notorious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey full of strawberry patals: masking as waiters set a French restaurant on fire; creating chaos as they sink on Volt's deck of luxury yachts; and English launches a clean anarchy when she tries to use the virtual reality of Volna.
All the essays are certainly ready for this last sequence, but whatever it is more kind and stormy, it has something in it from children's television.
It's quite a moderate matter.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour denies that they would develop a plan for the British to work four days a week to get paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is set to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and get paid in five.
The party reportedly wants CEOs to pass on savings to workers resulting from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would still receive the same reward.
Sources claim that this idea would “go” into the party’s economic agenda and plan to tilt the country for the benefit of the workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
A long-time Labour member told the Sunday Times: “The assessment of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a wish that fits into the party’s stances on balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party has pledged a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
The Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day work week is not a policy of our party and the party does not take it into account.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to fulfill his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to return energy from “anonymous directors” and “experts” in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies do not have to return to their overall share, as the Labour government could carry out “hits” on the basis of perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the board of directors of companies and create equity funds that transfer 10% of private enterprise equity to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said in the "60 Minutes" series whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their opinion
The FBI’s investigation into the indictment against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, prompting the question of whether the finding could push some Republican senators into seeking their support.
In an interview on Sunday's "60 Minutes", correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could reveal anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy looked more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened when the charges came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham’s decision, however, is insurmountable.
"I've already made my decision over Brett Kavanaugh, and it would be a really explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she named could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what did it do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the annual Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, offering a very impressive range of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival in its seventh year welcomes tens of thousands of people who will come together in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the event, which is the end of the extreme 20th century.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to be able to get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, emailing the world leader, phone calls or other meaningful ways to get help.
But how successful was Global Citizen 12 years ago before it achieved its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really the way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” – people who feel that by signing online petitions or tweeting, something changes?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” by its supporters, trying to achieve various goals.
He says these actions have contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and measures worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group announced 390 commitments and notifications resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that secured funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a British partnership of investors and developers committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citations.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, like you, we can only make a note of social injustice in the form of malnutrition in history,” Power of Nutrition project ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in Loj<0xC3><0xBD>n in 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will address 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on your website with the question, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The global citizen replied: “It will be a long and hard road – sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movement, we succeed in front of us because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the performers at this year’s New York show, which will host Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy for “Block” to Prevent Russian Energy Exports - Interior Minister
Washington could "if necessary" resort to the navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy, just like in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has this opportunity to use our navy to make sure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, blocked, to make sure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that in the United States is considered the “voice of energy consumers”.
He compared Washington’s approach and negotiations with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are practically the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less investment in or replacement of propellants,” he said, referring to Russia as a “single-purpose” player with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and has replaced Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step down from the “unfit” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump said had made from Berlin “the hostage” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is supposed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce resistance to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for the development of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The US has taken a stance from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s largest industrial organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the United States to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third country intervenes in our energy supplies,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren promises to “closely look” at 2020 presidential candidacy, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the midterm elections, she “looks closely” at the candidacy for president.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top female position,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will take a closer look at the presidential candidacy.”
During the meeting, Warren also mentioned Donald Trump and said she “leads this country in the wrong direction.”
“I fear to the bone of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren said on Twitter on Friday: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed that most Warren voters do not think she should run for president in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The survey showed greater support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile democratic names that have been discussed in connection with the potential candidacy for 2020, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after being listed in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, may be about other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are going back with,” she told an audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called this arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans that "some others are coming back, they are coming back to heal, they are coming back and they are asking if there is any respect for the things their fellow soldiers and airmen are doing, and what they are doing.
He was arrested on Monday in the town of Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with reports of domestic violence, and holding arms in custody, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supports the call for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new measure by the U.S. government that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from eighteen states and the district in Washington on Friday issued a short message to support asylum seekers and question the measure, NBC said.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which was filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Organization against federal policy, was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his sons and members of the violent gang" abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Attorneys from Grace-supporting states have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing ubiquitous gang and domestic violence problems.
The new asylum policy in the U.S. has reversed the 2014 U.S. Senate’s decision to appeal to immigrants, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of the D.C. said in a statement Friday that the new measure “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” said a short friend.
Lawyers have also briefly argued that policies that deny immigrants entry harm the U.S. economy and say they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “add the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June, according to the report.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or because of political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Pal, where the number of victims has already risen twice, compete in the search for survivors with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
“It’s very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who comforted her hot boyfriend at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance will bring in more bodies.
Clean water is rare.”
Residents have been seen returning to their ruined homes, picking up through the swampy stuff, and trying to save whatever they find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were destroyed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were damaged.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fracture of his spine and shoulder, were resting at Paluo Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continuing severe follow-up shocks.
Tears filled his eyes when he felt that the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I was dragged into the destruction of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town because of the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're all right."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Shocking’ Propaganda Ads
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. daily dedicated to the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned a paid supplement to the China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the state of the biggest selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to meddle in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials said Reuters was a new phase of Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an escalating trade war that manifests itself at the level of mutual imports.
China’s early-war defense sanctions were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, a U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had injured U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a statement on Sunday in the Des Moines Register that China is now doubling this harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press to place paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in a newspaper stand on the street in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and you will see no real reflection of the dissenting views that the Chinese might have on China’s disturbing economic trajectory, given that the media belongs to the Communist Party.
He added that "one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspapers.
Republicans leave their voters before the election due to a debacle with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
How many top Republicans are defending a candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple charges of sexual assault, the analyst warned that during the upcoming midterm elections they will know the answer, especially from women.
The emotions around this case were extremely high and most Republicans on the record already say they want to continue with the vote.
These things can't be returned," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell's University School in Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) will at the last minute try to investigate the FBI will be enough to calm the voters down.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday — they won’t forget it tomorrow, or even in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, a newspaper in D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is approaching!" at a demonstration in the Senate Hall, where Republicans in charge of the judiciary decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say it was already high, that’s true.”
But it could be higher, especially among the women’s voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who don’t like the president, but often don’t go to the polls.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, detailing her allegations of sexual assault on a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if Republicans confirmed it, she could follow the opposition.
“It was a confusing mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote, it’s not about whether Kavanaugh sits on the table, it’s also about how the Republicans managed it and how they handled it,” said Guy Cecil, the U.S. director of priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats from the canon.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided in opinion, whom to believe in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more sympathy for the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from the Flake FBI, he is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunkly assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitalia at a party during his study at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet and run Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s Open Source platform called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who people have access to information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee, he joked that the goal of the Inrupt project is “world domination.”
"We have to do it now," he said of this startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Disk Google, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is exceptional about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to the CEO of John Bruce, the Inrupt project aims to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform that IBM bought, some employees who work on the project, collaborated on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.

Bernard Vann: A celebration of the spiritual that received the Victoria Cross during the First World War
Celebrations have been held for hundreds of years since the sole spiritual Church of England won the Victoria's Cross as a fighter during World War I.
Reverend Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, the gunman killed him, and he never learned that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone to him on Saturday at a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his lawyers, Michael Vann, said it was "geniusly symbolic" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather's victory.
According to the London Gazette on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very dense fog and a powerful shot of field artillery and machine guns.
He later got to the front line and with the "highest courage" he led the line forward before throwing himself into the fire field and knocking three separate units.
Lieutenant Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never have done, but at the same time something that is humiliating.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, after a tour led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, they laid a wreath.
Michael Vann said he "felt great honor to be able to participate in the screening," adding that "the bravery of a true hero is manifested by the support provided by a lot of people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead getting Peppa pig
Imagine you've been waiting all night to watch the bloated Bellator 206, just to have your main event denied.
The San José account contained 13 points, including six on the main card and live broadcasts took place in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for a game against each other, viewers in the UK remained amazed when the news turned out to be about Peppa Pigs.
Some were left unmoved after waking up in the early hours of the morning due to a fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change in broadcasting for children as "a certain form of bad joke."
“Under the government regulation, such content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., and therefore it is necessary to broadcast children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator after being asked about this transmission.
"Fuck Peppa, yes."
Bellator President Scott Coker said that they will work on the program so that viewers in the UK will also be involved in the future.
"I think when I think about broadcasting, we can probably manage it," Cooker said.
“But it’s six o’clock on Sunday morning and we won’t be able to do it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when that program changed, a lot of text was going back and forth, and not all of them were just friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, the government could have done it.
I promise you, it won't happen next time.
We cut it down to five games instead of six – as we normally do – and we tried our best to keep the promise to the fans and we failed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Minor’ for Sexuality
Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority towards everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to go for it.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like him” until he attended high school.
On Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that due to the possibility of becoming a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular moderator of Kirsty Young's long-running show had several months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a trouser on Lavern's first program, said he felt "less valuable" than anyone else who grew up with him because "it wasn't socially unacceptable for you guys and girls to like."
He said: “Until now, these feelings of inferiority and indifference were real things that gave me strength and power to succeed.”
He wanted to prove he was “someone,” he said, not to disappoint anyone who might find out what his sexuality is like.
A two-time bronze Olympic medalist has become a high-profile LGBT rights fighter and has used his presence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to multiple countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he responded because he felt lucky that he could live an open life without consequences and wanted to give others “hope”.
This three-time world champion said that his falling in love with a man – American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “has caught up with the unprepared.”
Daley took an Oscar holder, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“If you experience so much at such a young age – he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was not easy to find someone at the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley’s son in June, and Daley said he had “changed his whole point of view.”
“If you asked me last year, it would be all in the style of ‘I want to get a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t agree that he was going to die, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him – you won’t be in the first place, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and until the moment he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
A year later, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew I’d dreamed about it my whole life – jumping in front of the eyes of our hosts at the Olympics, I don’t know how it feels better,” he said.
It was also inspired by the selection of his first song – “Roud” by Heather Small – which resonated with him at the start of the Olympics and still evoked the furry skin in it.
The show Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, finished on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson would have reached the record on Sunday when he played 47 games in the Ryder Cup, but he would have to sort out the form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played at an event held every two years at a record low, sent Captain Jim Furyk to Saturday's fourballs and foursomes on the bench.
Instead of being at the center of events, as was often the case in the United States, the five-time main winner spent his day alternately among cheerleaders and working on the game in a row he hoped would fix what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most direct of drivers, not even at the top of his career, so it’s not the ideal choice for Le Golf National’s narrow court, where a long field routinely punishes stray shots.
And unless the golf course itself is worrying enough, Mickelson faces the exact British Open champion Francesc Molinari in the ninth Sunday match, who has won all four of his games this week in the team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who had four points less, started 12 separate swords, avoided a quick start, Mickelson’s sword could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man and added nothing else.
“He totally understood the role he had today, he was crying over my back, he put his hand around my shoulder and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He believes so much.
He is a member of the Blues of straw and in the past and this week has been so beneficial to these teams.
I don't think I could have imagined he'd play two swords.
I imagined more, but that's how it developed, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson beat Nick Falda's record in most Western Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which has never reached the height of its individual record.
Mickelson scored 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence brought some tangible results to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make fun of people and he’s a great companion in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed the fun they were after him this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a great lead to singles from the last days of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut at the 1997 match in Valderram, where the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they got into the finish line with a total close victory of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You have to keep in mind that we had a big jump in Valderram, as well as in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but only closely,” said Bjorn, on the picture, after watching when in the 2018–10 win-the–5 win in the 2018–5 round.
So history and every member of that team showed me that it's not behind us.
You'll be bored tomorrow.
Go there and do all the right things.
It's not up to you until all those points are on the board.
Our goal is to try and win this trophy, and that's what we're focused on.
“I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to do on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with the way his players played on a complex golf course, added: “I would never have done it myself.
Tomorrow there will be other animals waiting for us.
Tomorrow, individual performances are being prepared, and that's too difficult.
It’s great to be out with your partner when it’s going well, but when you have to be there alone, your golfer’s capacity is fully tested.
This is a message that you have to pass on to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave a partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself too.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will take care of his players playing better as individuals than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these major setbacks when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn to end up as defeated when Europe reached the "Miracle in the Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he replied to a question as Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players to aim for the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to start as fast as in Brooklyn, as in the Medina.
When this pace goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle games.
So we set up the set up and made sure the boys felt like you know, like we were supposed to charm tomorrow."
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the counterattack and standing with Rory McIlroy in a top-flight match with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“I went with that group of guys in this series because I think it covers the whole way,” Bjorn said of his selection of singles.
Germany's new warship has been rescheduled
The latest German naval frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but will not be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and a snowy coast, local media said.
The commissioning of the leading ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", a brand new frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was delayed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to become part of the Navy in 2014, but the difficult problems after the delivery made the fate of this ambitious project unsatisfactory.
As a replacement for Bremen-class aging frigates, four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will serve, which the Navy ordered in 2007.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with a powerful drill, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies, such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important functions include a long maintenance period – it should be possible to install the latest frigates for up to two years outside the home port.
However, constant delays mean that top naval vessels – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces overseas – will be obsolete by the time they are put into service, says Die Zeit.
The infamous F125 frigate got into the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the manufacturers after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of major "software errors and metal element malfunctions" that would make the warship unusable when deployed in combat.
The competition for the software was particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuertemberg-class vessel will operate a crew of some 120 sailors – half of the workers who were needed on Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship has a considerable excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfal will be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defects on the metal elements, the problem is also the cost of the whole project – including the training of the crew.
It is said that from the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion, the price has reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates have gained significance especially in the light of recent warnings that the German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, confirmed that the navy was indeed “coming ships capable of deploying.”
This representative stated that the problems were constantly being tackled, as the old ships were withdrawn from service, but no replacements were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuertemberg class were able to become part of the Navy's equipment.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
At the site of bats in the Scottish Highlands, a new research is being carried out to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting for food.
There is hope that the research findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future activities to preserve this species.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will monitor bats starfish and the smallest and brown long and watery in the Inverewe Gardens botanical garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the key areas of this non-tower headquarters, which will monitor the activities of non-towers throughout the year.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of calls of bats and what individual species are doing.
Next, a map of the habitat and a message will be published that will create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Natural Resources Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how individual species use them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and the best procedure for maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
In the last century, the population of Scotland and the whole of Great Britain was largely wiped out.
They are at risk as a result of construction and territorial development, which affect the colonies and the natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks, can also pose a risk.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting for prey.
They use the ingenious echo-location technique to perform bells and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
He has trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, check colonies, and sometimes also rescue work.
The organization has even established the first and only reserved bat reservation at the Threadave headquarters in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
Headquarter manager David Thompson says it’s an ideal area for them.
"We have a great area for bats here at Threat," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there’s still too much we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking the bats before starting maintenance work in real estate, because it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one mother's nest can kill up to 400 females and juveniles, which can destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass, disrupt or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to put their hand to work and help.
She said: “About our bats and a lot of species that we don’t know how their populations are doing, we still have a lot to learn.”
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape, and his lawyers are about to sue the German newspaper.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the charges of rape “fake news” and said people “wanted to be visible” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which reported these accusations.
This Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorgy in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep the case quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
A few hours after the indictment was released, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers and labeled the information as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-time Golden Ball award holder in the camera.
“They want to live on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm fine," said the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald’s lawyers are going to sue Der Spiegel for unsubstantiated charges, which they called an “unacceptable notice of suspicion in the private sector.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will claim compensation for "moral damage in the amount of the corresponding seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times."
The incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in Palms Hotel’s suite and in a Las Vegas casino.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the game, where they allegedly raped her by the court records in Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo collapsed after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "laden" and "one percent" disappointed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also stated that she went to the police and let her take photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "feared of retaliation" and was afraid of "public humiliation".
A 34-year-old woman claims she is now trying to resume the procedure because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the charge of the attack steps from the transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he was bought by the famous Italian club Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain will regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
The UK will "forever regret" if it loses its status as world leader in automobile manufacturing after Brexit, said company secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "terrifying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"A deal is necessary," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays on borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
At the Burnastone plant, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis cars are produced, nearly 150,000 cars were produced last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“My view is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would have seen a halt in production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnastone.
Other automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on the operation of a cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its production plant for Mini cars in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers refer to as risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is in operation on the basis of deliveries "just in time", with parts from suppliers in the UK and EU being delivered for cars manufactured on order within 37 minutes.
If Britain left the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be a breach at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to have the stock in stock for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus the production would be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s plans to revive future relations with the EU were “exactly calibrated to avoid these border controls.”
"We need an agreement, we want to have the best deal that will enable, as I say, not only the current success, but also the seizure of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful set of supply chains."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will be halted, but in the long run it warns that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the race and ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is chairman of the race teams, said that members of the organization are increasingly concerned: “I have experience that once these places disappear, they will never come back.
The government said: “We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be “rejected next week” as he continues to fight for the post of supreme judge with Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller’s special council, which investigates Russian election interventions, ties between Trump’s supporters and Russia, and possible judicial obstructions on the part of the president.
Whether Trump will release a representative of the General Staff and threaten Mueller’s independence, the Washington talks have been going on for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of sitting the president through the 25th appendix.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump stated that Rosenstein would not “prefer” to let go, but then the meeting was delayed, so as not to interfere with a hearing at the Senate Judiciary Committee, where they gave testimony to Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Blaine.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI a weekly investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the full Senate vote once again.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared in news on the Fox channel on Sunday.
Asked at a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date has not yet been set, it may be this week, it may be necessary to move on to the next week, given everything else that is going on at the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I will always communicate the current information to the media.”
Some reporters disagree with the claim: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders said too few press conferences had been caused by an aversion to the "devastatement" of television reporters, even though she said: "I don't agree with the fact that he's going to perform."
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is holding more meetings with questions and answers than any president before him," she added, without giving any evidence. "We were looking at those numbers."
The conference will continue, Sanders said, but “if press representatives had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than talking to me.
We are testing it and you have seen that we are doing it in the last few weeks and that there will be a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly takes questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting high-ranking officials.
Independent press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president has probably shown why his relaxed and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland not to be afraid of Brexit
The Ministry of Health has written to EU employees who work in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wish for them to remain even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman’s MSP sent a letter not less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying the costs of applying for the status of settlement of EU citizens who work in transferred public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continue, and they are heading towards the expected decision this autumn.
The British government, however, is also taking steps to prepare for a possible no-deal withdrawal scenario.
I know it must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reassure you again how much I appreciate the contributions of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare services and are beneficial to patients and the communities we provide services to.
“Scotland is absolutely your home and our wish is for you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie to undergo emergency surgery after head injury
A retired Tigers defender from the state of Tennessee Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgical procedure after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat from rival Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed there," Reed said.
The trainers and the medical staff put Abercrombie on the sidelines of the oxygen and then put him on a stretcher and prepared for further assessment.
A Tennessee official told Chrisz Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details of the type/range of injury are available yet" and that the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a Red T-shirt co-star, finished the first season for the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
Before the game ended on Saturday, he had five total moves, which means a total of 18 moves in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on real estate when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when they buy real estate in the UK, with additional money being used to help the homeless as part of Tory’s new plans.
This act will neutralize the success of Corbyn's move, which aims to attract young voters
The increase in the liability of higher property taxes will be applicable to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
An increase of <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year is expected to help homeless people
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher tax on the purchase of real estate when they buy real estate in the UK, with additional money being used to help homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s drive to attract young voters with the pledge to provide affordable accommodation and focus on people with high incomes.
The increase in property tax will apply to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, while the money will further strengthen the government’s efforts to fight sleep without a roof over their heads.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current obligation to pay taxes on the purchase of real estate, including the higher levels introduced two years ago at other homes and the purchase for rental purposes, can reach up to three percent.
It is expected that the state treasury will increase funds by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
Estimates say that newly built property in London buys 13 percent of citizens who are not residents of the UK, which pushes prices and makes it easier for those who buy for the first time to get to the top of the house.
Many of the country’s rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “city of spirits” precisely because of the high number of overseas buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new rules came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in property purchase tax to help more young people get to their own first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by taking up land but not using it, and urged Mrs. May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to fix “unsatisfactory homes” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of proposed housing reforms, including the management of rents and the end of “unusual” removals.
It also wants to increase the power of committees to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I want to dedicate my efforts as prime ministers to restoring the British dream – so that every new generation has a better life.
And that means correcting our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it may not be right to make it easy for entities that do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to be able to buy homes as well as hard-working UK residents.
For many people, the dream of their own home is too far away and the fall of sleep without a roof over their heads is too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My highest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "highest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at a certain stage.
42-year-old Scott is looking forward to the challenge of restoring the northeast club, which currently ranks third in the Premier League, just three degrees below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B rating and it was," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that’s always something that attracts me back.
But such an opportunity would only come if I were successful in leading the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's managers were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he didn’t feel any concern about the succession of such established names in such a big club when he previously rejected pre-games from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success would have been a question for me at the time if I could return this club to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and equipment in this club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him back there, but I think I would have been successful if I could get the club back there.”
Ross has only been in leadership for three years, previously serving as an assistant manager at Dumarton, and spent 15 months as one of the Hearts coaches.
He then helped the Alloa club recover from the downhill to the third group and transformed St Mirren from a starting downhill to a championship winner the following season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than he has ever had in his career players at clubs Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“They were probably real crusaders,” he recalls the time when Alloa was engaged.
“I really believed that leadership was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was good, made good by it, and enjoyed the right heights.
But playing can be challenging.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still go through them from the point of view of the stress and pressure of that work, but in management I just feel good.
“I’ve always wanted to be a manager, and now I’m doing it, I feel like I feel the most in my adult life now.”

Research found that a great time on the pint is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer wave has increased the revenue of British pubs dealing with difficulties, but has increased the pressure on the chain of restaurants.
The figures show that groups of pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 per cent in July – but restaurant revenue fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, which created the final reports, said: “Stable sunlight and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, when the attendance was increased by 2 percent.
The drop in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June was even worse in July.
The hosts and bars that attract drinks have so far conducted themselves most strongly in the same way that restaurants have deteriorated.
Lords, whose main markets are food, also suffered from the sun, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between the managed values and bars, beverage sales rose by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales fell by three per cent.
Paul Newman of the analytical leisure and hospitality company said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
Weather and the influence of significant social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It’s no surprise that the restaurant chains continue to fight, even though the annual drop in sales of 4.8 percent will be particularly painful in light of ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer cannot be a worse time for operators of food-inducing businesses, and the time will tell whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring so much needed relief."
Overall sales growth in restaurants and pubs, including newly opened ones, accounted for 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentation.

One in five children have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – aged just 11 – have a secret social media account that hides from parents and educators, research shows.
Research among 20,000 high school students has shown an increase in “fake Instagram pages”
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content will be published.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” account that their parents know about.
One in five children – at the age of just 11 – create accounts on social networks that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “fake Instagram accounts” on which they share photos.
Reports indicate that there are concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have an embellished “main” account that their parents know about, and at the same time have a private account.
One mother, who ran into her 13-year-old daughter’s secret web site, found that her teenage daughter was urging others to “rape her.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools showed that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half admitting they run private accounts.
HMC boss Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the 'voice of athletes' on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most acclaimed light athlete and President Ian Beattie has described the move as a great opportunity for those who are in charge of sports like those for whom her far-reaching international experience over the past decade will be useful.
“Eilidh has extensive respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that it will be of considerable benefit to Scotland’s athletics if it becomes a member of the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be really beneficial and to help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had an attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I'm healed or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've been able to fully recover, I've learned to walk again, and today I can handle the exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!"
Milk sucker evoking the comparison of mothers to cows shares opinions online
The company involved in the production of vacuum cleaners has divided online opinion by advertising, which compares nursing mothers to nursing cows.
As part of the launch of the "world's first silent portable vacuum cleaners", the consumer technology company Envi has released a music video with an overlay showing the freedom that the new vacuum cleaner gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing in a barn full of cows singing, "Yes, I can feel it, but you can't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed I don't have a swab, my breasts are here."
The congregation continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, feed my sweet milk.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked an online controversial reaction.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of whom said it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very poor decision to abuse cows for advertising this product.
Just like us, we need to be pregnant and give birth so that they can give milk, but their children are taken a few days after birth,” says one of the comments.
Elvie sucker discreetly sucks on her breast (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Clearly traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them for breast pump advertising for mothers who leave their children behind?”
Someone else added, “This ad is completely out of date.”
There were also those who defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that the song was considered “infectious”.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd get that pump if I was still barking.
I feel just like a cow when I'm weaning.
Advertising is a little crazy, but it's up to you.
It's a great product," one user wrote.
Another added: “It’s a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who suck milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘crabs’.
It’s not an advertisement that should praise or curse the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all dance with discreet suckers hidden under the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception that many women who suck milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie sucker is completely quiet, has no wires or hoses and hides beautifully in the bra for breastfeeding, so it gives women freedom of movement, the ability to hold the baby and even walk when suckling.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD for mothers, added: “The Elvie sensor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a significant and provocative launch.
By creating a parallel between nursing mothers and nursing cows, we wanted to point to the milk withdrawal and all the challenges associated with it, while showing a fun and reliable incredible sense of freedom that the new sucker will provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie's sucker has been fired.
During London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers of designer Marta Jakubowski, who was just using the product, appeared at the mall.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of children detained by migrants has risen sharply despite the fact that the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, especially since the tough rhetoric and principles introduced by the Trump administration have made it easier to place children with escorts.
Most escorts were traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants who were afraid of endangering the possibility of staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household must provide fingerprints and that this data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Department, testified through Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had applied for the status of escorting single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
Up to 80 percent of people who are sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to prosecute them," Mr Albence said.
According to the officials of the asylum facilities, representatives in an effort to deal with matters relating to children more quickly have introduced new rules, which will require some of them to be brought before the court within a month of detention, instead of the previous standard 60 days.
A lot will appear through calls within the videoconference instead of in person to declare their case a legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely he or she is to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempts to escape, asylum workers say, and report from the system over the past few months.
Lawyers state that these concerns are heightened in larger devices, such as Tornillo, where there are signs that the child is suffering, more likely not to be noticed, precisely because of the size of the device.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time devoted to emotional preparation or goodbye with friends could trigger a trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria has announced that the US, French and Turkish "occupational components" are to be immediately withdrawn
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, even though the country has already been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the acting prime minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian territory are illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "it will be dealt with accordingly."
"He must give up immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terrorism in Syria is almost over", with more than 360,000 people dead and millions more missing from their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus will continue to fight “in this holy battle until we rid all Syrian territory” of terrorist groups and “any illegal aliens present.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
France has more than 1,000 units in the war-torn country.
In issuing the refugees, Moualem said they were in good condition for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational concerns" that caused the refugees to not want to return.
“We have called on international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be available for Syria to recover until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a security zone in the last Idlib stronghold has created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Syrian forces protected by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the deal has "clearly given deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would focus on jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters with ties to al-Qaeda, who "will be expelled."
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition will be held soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and postpone the way to the elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited "to the control of the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning before the intervention.
Why Trump will win in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would win the next election in 2020, if, hopefully, many liberal observers hope, the complaint and scandals of his office as president would not end prematurely.
In that case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidential term in history!”
So far, there are no signs of follow-up fatigue.
Since 2014, the mainstream broadcast time follow-up has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average follow-up of 2.4 million in prime time, an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen and “The Rachel Maddow Show” on MSNBC has increased cable TV follow-up to 3.5 million followings from mainstream nighttime shows.
“It’s a heat that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the operator of the “Designated Survivor” series on ABC drama about the secretary of the cabinet, who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy author and television series "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he's having fun with him, 'said Mrs. Scovell.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story taking place in of Washington could predict the future of Roe v. Wada, whether or not immigrant families can reunite and benefit the global economy.
Matching is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes beyond whether you’re an informed citizen when you’re watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward uses “deep backup” resources for his book “Fear,” a slick-skinned gangster Paul Manafort’s “not worth $15,000” and “not worth a dollar” postage to Trump.
I'm not going to look at Super Maria in the same way again.
“Part of what he’s doing and what makes you feel like a reality show is that he’s feeding you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the Pawn Stars documentary about N.F.L. Trump’s rotating show, in which he values Kim Jong-un.

He could not break apart, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in dire straits.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.

Money is flowing from the outside into the tightest domestic mid-term elections
It’s no surprise that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a surge of finance thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts, which were generated by two office holders fighting for the same chair.
This recently led to the creation of the suburban district of Pittsburg by district Democratic Republican Conor Lamb – who won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another official, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily overlapped with the new 17th.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans, the map was redrafted.
The race in the new 17th district started a fierce financial split between the main party’s financial branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the March special election in the 18th congressional district.
This chair was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight jump in.
America is considering punishing Salvador in support of China, then resigns
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing under the mild pressure of Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until the partners were able to judicially evict Trump’s organizational team.
Foreign Ministry officials have decided to withdraw U.S. diplomatic mission directors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan further," ministry spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement issued earlier this month.
But the fines were considered only against Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included a reduction in financial aid and focused on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and number of murders.
With continued internal negotiations, the North American and Central American representatives postponed the high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity following similar negotiations from the previous year, which was viewed as a step forward in the U.S. efforts to advance the transition.
But by mid-September, the top administration officials had explained that they wanted to continue negotiations and effectively end any considered fines for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of resolving the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of a signal that the administration is putting on the talks, diplomats said.
And three U.S. envoys quietly returned to Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without having any new unscrupulous news from Washington.
The White House spokesman, Mr Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on the terms of anonymity.
Their sources have been confirmed by an external analyst who has close to the government executive and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
History of study
A definitive nail in the coffin could be Robert Mueller’s report from the Special Commission on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump’s enforcement of the law, which is now in the public records with a lot of evidence.
In his investigation, Mr. Mueller is also allegedly referring to whether Mr. Trump’s campaign did not contain a secret agreement with Russia regarding the attack on our elections.
If there were to be an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to apply to that body for accountability, just as he is preparing to appear again in front of voters, and in the end, a jury composed of his colleagues would probably be waiting for him.
This is a whole series of “ifs”, and I do not want to say that Mr Trump’s fall is inevitable – as is the case with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice ahead of us that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to organize a coup against Hitler, it was enough for the Western powers to stand up to him and support him in Munich, Czechoslovakia.
We moved and missed the opportunity to avoid a long years of bloodshed that followed. . . .
History revolves around such critical moments as to speed up or slow down the impromptu course of democracy.
The Americans are now facing a number of similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, this is the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been excited about it ever since the report announced that he had secretly proposed to record the president last year and speculated that he was not in a health condition so that he could stop the presidential office.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the Times version is inaccurate.
“How do we react if the newly requested investigation by F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or what if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite a convincing charge of sexual assault and a false statement?
And most importantly, will we vote in the middle of the term in Congress, which will assign responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will wait for a long dark night.
But I believe that we are not moving, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles on the table with swastika on Saturday.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such a legacy?”

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is optimistic about the collision with Rapid Vienna
Rangers on Thursday host Rapid Vienna with the knowledge that the victory over Raku<0xC5><0x9F>ana after an impressive draw in Spain at Villarreal earlier this month would give them great hope for a move from Group G of the European League.
The injury to the knee prevented the substitute Graham Dorrans from appearing on the pitch for the first time in the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal. However, he believes that Rangers can use the result as a reflection bridge to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a good team," the 31-year-old said.
“We went into a fight with the belief that we could score something, and we took the point.
Maybe we could have multiplied it in the end, but overall the draw was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second we got better and we were better again.
It will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be difficult, because in the last game they paid a good result, but with the spectators behind me I'm sure we can push and it's going to be good.
Last year was pretty hard, with all of my injuries and changes at the club, but now I feel really good about it.
The team is strong and the guys really enjoy it, the training is fine too.
I hope we stick to it now, put it behind our backs last season and we will be successful."
Women Worry About Saving on Retirement
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people talked about it with family members.
About half of the people in the nationwide study said they were discussing the price of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t decide to discuss it with them,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Agency.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t reveal your wishes to them in advance.
Together with your counselor and family, consider where and how to take care, because these factors can play a big role in determining the price.
Invite your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
You can finance long-term care, for example, by using traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance, which will help you pay for these expenses, or by using your own insurance using your own funds – as long as you have money.
Create your own legal documents: Prevent legal battles as long as it goes.
You appoint a representative for healthcare, which will be a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that your doctors comply with your wishes if you are not able to communicate on your own.
Also consider a full power write-down for your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make a financial decision for you and ensure that your accounts are played in the event that you are not able to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old parent necessarily needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan to get you ready.
“It’s not just finance, but what are the names of the doctors?” asked Martin.
“Where are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready at hand.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pal on Friday, according to authorities, the number of casualties is expected to continue to rise.
As communications are out of service, the aid units were unable to obtain any information from the Donggal regent, an area north of Pal, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Pal after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the city of Pal and the regency of Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city has just celebrated its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunamis.
Donggala is a regency stretching more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
The regency, the administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of Central Sulawesi province are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, the tsunami has hit several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggale killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Tsunami hit the west of Donggala in 1996, when it claimed nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and there is a regular earthquake here.
Here is a list of some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the northern part of Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and prepared the lives of 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in the province of Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the south of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regent in Aceh province and caused destruction and panic as people were reminded of the devastating effects of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 died as a result of falling buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, where it killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily incarcerated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charge
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers agency, 29-year-old Palin, who lives in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, reporting domestic violence, and preventing arrest.
When, according to the police report, his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin picked up the phone.
Palin was sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is detained on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reports.
According to the network's report, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he felt "absolutely innocent" when questioned for the statement.
Fuel faces three Class A offenses, which means it could be sentenced to up to a year of deprivation of liberty and up to $250,000 in fines.
At the same time, he was charged with a Class B offence punishable by one-day imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palina.
The alleged attack on the police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin, by telephone.
The case is currently before the Algerian court for war veterans.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, infringing domestic violence reports, and keeping weapons under the influence of fraudulent substances in connection with the incident.
He allegedly punched his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by groups of war veterans when her son’s violent behavior was linked to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by her son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesian Earthquakes and Tsunami: Hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communication networks are out of service and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake hit directly at the impact of part of the island of Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos depicting the moment of the earthquake have appeared on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand exceptional death penalty for suspect in NYC terror attack <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saip, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – an exceptional punishment that has not been awarded for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly carried out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October using a rented Home Depot truck that drove pedestrians and cyclists away.
To defend the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saip "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused a number of injuries - this is how the terms of the death penalty are defined according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York court.
According to court documents, both of these numbers would mean the possibility of awarding the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury accused Saip of 22 criminal acts, including charges of murder in favor of extortion, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and charges of violence and murder.
The attack called for "significant planning and preparation", the prosecutors say, describing the way Saip's act was carried out as appalling, cruel and twisted.
"Sayfullo Habibullahevic Saipov caused injury, pain and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alenca.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York last awarded the death penalty.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced in September 2009 to life imprisonment.
The last death penalty was actually carried out in connection with a federal case in New York in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed, which proved conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years.
Both Rosenbergs were seated in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, expressed minimal regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he said he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saip told authorities that he was inspired by watching videos of the Islamic State on the phone to commit the attack.
The police also announced that it had also requested the suspension of the Islamic State flag in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public prosecutors representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the plaintiffs' decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting guilt and life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma from these events for anyone they relate to,” Patton said.
A team of Saip’s lawyers had earlier asked the plaintiffs not to demand the death penalty.
Members of the Conservative Party say he should be in charge of negotiations on Brexit NIGEL FARAGE
Nigel Farage pledged to “mobilize the army of the people” during today’s protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of the United Kingdom's Independence Party said that politicians must "feel pressure" from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested, he should be negotiating with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain “would have been out now” if he had been Secretary of Brexit Mr Farage.
But the problem that Mrs May faces in the reconciliation of her ranks, where there is a deep divide, has been highlighted by conservatives fighting for survival in the EU, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his Chequers compromise plan under attack by Brexit supporters, EU supporters, and the EU itself.
The Allies insist that they will continue to try to agree with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone said that the group "Leave Means Leave" gathered in Solihull, where he wanted to "send on Chequers".
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he were in charge, we would be out today,” he said.
Mr Wellingborough said: “I will stand for Brexit, but we have to knock out the Chequers.”
To show his resistance to the EU, he said: "We did not fight the world wars to listen.
In our own country, we want to make our own laws.”
Mr. Bone rejected proposals that public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: “The idea that British citizens would change their mind and want to hold on to it is absolutely outrageous.”
The Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns, who also took part in the rally, told reporters: “I simply say, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for them and they don’t like it by members of our party or by our activists who are currently filling the streets to be elected at all.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.’
In a sharp report to Mrs May, she says: "The Prime Minister will retain his place if they keep their promises."
Farage said conservative politicians must “get into an uncomfortable situation” if they want to betray their decision made on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us – people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to give up Brexit and we’re standing here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you do this.’”
In a report, he said: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit, to feel pressure.
“We are now mobilizing the army of the people of this country who have secured victory for us in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become independent and proud of the UK that governs itself.”
In the meantime, supporters of the Union's stay in Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the centre of the city.
Several activists were transparent with the Conservatives against Brexit after the weekend of the party’s start.
Labour MP Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives over the safety of the party’s application after the conference began.
“These are people who, in their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
The whole thing is a straw.
There is nothing like a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘think hard’ his candidacy for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "think hard about running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking a November re-election against Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She felt at the center of speculation that she could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall since Trump sat in office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for the office of the President.
Warren responded that the time had come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which also means a woman in the highest place.
He was arrested on suspicion of shooting Sims of LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in Friday's shooting of LSU basketball player Wayda Simse.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson at 11:00 ET news conference.
A video from Friday's shooting was released requesting identification of the man captured on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that did not coincide with life,” Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told media on Saturday via the web 247sports.
Wayde tried to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was moving at the scene of the crime, had a gun, and confessed to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot and 6-inch tall Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, 10 of which were last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Champion title as team director takes the victory over Sebastian Vettel in his hands
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished in Saturday’s qualifier against Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes’ team management would play a big role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the field position and almost got Hamilton out of the way when he defended his position in the first two laps and called on Vettel to attack the team mate.
Vettel took to the depot as the first and let Hamilton touch the cars that circle the group's tail, which should be decisive.
The driver of the Mercedes entered the depot about a lap later, and after leaving, he was behind Vettel. However, Hamilton advanced and in a close fight, the Ferrari driver had to unwittingly leave the inner track free to defend himself in the third lap after the double.
Max Verstappen left the back row and was in charge at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race because he held the original tyres as long as possible to focus on the quick finish and could take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
In the end, he entered the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he was no longer able to increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he acted like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done a fantastic job and the reward is the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday’s meeting for insisting she didn’t publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at a meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly mention Ford’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead stating that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil and repulsive and profanity.”
“One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that’s happening in the last days of Senar when you see the anger when you see those people, how angry and evil and repulsive and delusional,” he said.
“When you look at the publication and they say to you, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you afford the escape?
Remember her answer... you published the document – “Ah, ah, what?
Oh, no.
She didn't publish."
Well, wait a minute.
We've published... No, so no," he added, imitating the senator.
The Feinsteins sent Ford a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July and the information escaped at the beginning of September – but Feinstein refused to allow the escape from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s pleas, nor did I disclose information about the case,” Feinstein told The Hill.
“She asked me to keep everything a secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do.”
However, according to her, the president, who on the case spoke at the meeting on Saturday evening, did not believe her words: “I’ll tell you that this is a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but anyway, it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court judge, which three women accused of sexual harassment, and indicated that the Democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back the power of any available means.
“You see the cowardice, the cowardice, they don’t care who gets hurt, who has to be pushed into the country to get back into power and into the helm,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer has scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars scored a Friday loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants in a Saturday rematch in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The Giants soon seized a two-branch lead thanks to the interventions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were able to settle for home before Dwyer returned the Giants.
Francois Bouchard then compared Dundee again, and two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen brands secured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for Adam Keefe, who managed to defeat 2-1 in Belfast Dundee on Friday.
The two teams have already met for the fourth time in the season, with all three previous games being dominated by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, for Kendall McFaull's assist, while David Rutherford scored Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home back to the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cownie, who compared it at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went to the cabin for the first break only in the lead when he scored his second goal of the evening at the end of the first third.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again managed to equalize the goal from the force play at 27:37.
The joint work of Cownie and Charles Corcoran later in the second third helped Nielsen for the first time in the match to clinch the lead on the side of Dundee, and the same player secured the lead of his team in the semi-final third.
The Giants, who have now lost the fourth of the last five games, will play another game Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller has died to allow hundreds of people on board the plane to escape the earthquake.
Indonesia’s air traffic controller is celebrated as a hero after he died, watching the plane take off safely with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday triggered a tsunami.
The area was flooded by severe aftershocks, and many people remained trapped in the rubble of the city of Pal.
But despite the fact that colleagues of 11-year-old Anthony Gunawana Agunga fled to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in a wildly winding control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower down when he thought he was moving.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait told Australian television channel ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared the transport by helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was transported to the hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
Meanwhile, the responsible authorities expressed concern that the death toll could reach thousands. The agency responsible for disaster resolution said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is increasing because many bodies are still unresolved and many of them have not been rescued," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroh, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves in the devastated Pal have reached a height of up to six meters, and mass funerals will take place in the city on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft are bringing aid and supplies to the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulances bring more bodies.
There is a lack of drinking water.
Small shops are being stolen everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’ll find on the spot.
It’s a tragedy, but it could be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the country’s military personnel: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks that are necessary for evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by the Lombok earthquake this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now claims one person is missing after the plane crash in the lagoon
An airline operating a flight that crashed into a lagoon on one of the Micronesian islands in the Pacific has now reported that one person was missing, initially stating that all passengers and crew reading a total of 47 people were safely evacuating.
Air Niugini said in a press release that she was unable to find one passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it is cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in the search for the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details of the passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water in an attempt to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said Friday that a total of seven people had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in treatment even on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the exact track of the events, however, remains unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane was going over the track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed from very low altitudes.
"It was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that, along with the others, he managed to get water down the belt deep to the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He further stated that the crew panicked and cried, and that he himself suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who worked close to the adjustments to the docks helped rescue by a inflatable boat carrying passengers to the shore before the plane sank into a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, a total of 111 people have died in PNG-registered aircraft accidents, but no accidents have occurred at Air Niuguni.
Analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The charge on Saturday ended its speech in the case in which a man is repeatedly convicted of burning a woman for life in Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours and provided expert judgements in the field of intelligence analysis.
An analyst for the jury drew up a scenario of using records from the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was on the eve of her death at Chambers, which was contrary to his previous statement, the newspaper The Clarion Ledger said.
When the data from the cell phone showed that he was spending the night with Chambers, he found out that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who was then visited by the police.
Sanford stood before the jury and testified that the day in question was not in town.
When the plaintiffs questioned whether Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that "he lied because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another disagreement was that Tellis stated that he knew Chambers about two weeks from the day she died.
However, records from the mobile phone indicate that the two of them only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, he deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be heard before the court later that day.
High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions about this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The band High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political messages and solutions to social problems.
They therefore want to go back to the roots and once again popularize the conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have met with revival in the recent past thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?!
NY educator sues couple for their expulsion after "racist" text message
A New York schoolteacher is suing a couple for their discriminatory dismissal after receiving an erroneous text message from her mother, in which she was labeled a “other black” text message.
The couple denied that they were racists and compared the lawsuit to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was shocked when she found out on her first day at work in 2016 that her children’s new teacher, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NEE<0xC3><0x89><0xC3><0x89><0xC3><0x89>, D<0xC3><0x8D><0xC5><0xA0><0xC3><0x8D> <0xC4><0x8C>ERNO<0xC5><0xA0>KA," wrote Pi. Plasco-Flaxmanov<0xC3><0xA1> to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her pi twice.
When she understood her faux passport, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman’s “worried” wife fired Ms. Maurice and said that her teacher, who was African-American, was working really badly and that she was expecting the Philippines instead, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice received a salary for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Maurice now charges a couple of compensations for being fired from work and asks for a compensation of $350 per day of six-month engagement, for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that this is not happening,” the Post said Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
However, the two returned a blow with the fact that they were not racist, but that the termination of Ms. Maurice's employment was a suitable measure, because they feared that after the insult, they could no longer believe her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you entrust your child into the hands of someone to whom you behaved rudely, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
But come on."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “extortion,” saying his wife was only caring for a two-month-old child and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Would you drive after someone like that?
That's not a good thing at all," the investment banker said.
Although the trial is still ongoing, a social media jury quickly condemned the two for their behavior and logic.
Publishers of stories about the bear Paddington feared that readers would not identify with the talking bear, show the latest news
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, told the reporter: “It’s difficult to feel in the situation of someone reading it for the first time, even before it was published.
It’s very fun to know now that we already know the tremendous success of Paddington’s bear.”
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children’s book about a small plush bear, was very disappointed that his work had been rejected, adding on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, which became a “sweet one”.
To Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of her family," she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man, he was never in any way defiant," she said.
“But because Paddington was such a real character to him, it was like having a child who achieved something you can be really proud of.
I think he looked at Paddington's success with this view.
Even though it was his only creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all success to Paddington alone.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the hospital of Louise Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"He called me regularly to tell me it was really bad and he didn't expect her to get out of it," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I had a phone call from Nada, where she told me she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you dearly.
I'll be right there with you.
I'll be there with you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart going, slowly lost their effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was as if everything was closing down.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it inside me.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, entered the plane with the other passengers, without revealing what a difficult test she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
“I held my head shut, and I was running through my tears all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt an amazing understanding of Nadavi.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Depressed women send postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys broadcast Welsh Bridge postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers where people can look for support.
Tyler's son, Mrs. Davis, was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, as a result, took his own life at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any other parent to have to feel what I’ve been feeling every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a gifted young chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile was able to illuminate every room.”
However, before his death, he left work because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found the body of his sister-in-law after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried about how it's going to affect his life."
Mrs. Davis proposed a postcard, “to inform people that they have people at their disposal who are willing to help them and can talk to them, even if they are their friends.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who is a flight attendant of Mrs. Davies's girlfriend, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he was feeling down or depressed, nothing at all," he explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his behavior.
The worst was on Christmas Day – when the kids opened presents, they didn’t even look at them, nothing.”
She said that the death of her partner was a huge trauma for them, but that she must get through it gradually: “This is the kind of thing that can make a complete hole in the family.
We've been torn apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh depends on the balance of how the FBI begins its investigation
“I thought we could get something that he was actually asking for – an investigation at a time of limitation, with a limited scope – we could bring in a little unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would “disband” to the party because the party was going to “disband” because the party was going to split up.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away from us, on November 6, and if Republicans behave badly as expected, it will lead to their fundamental weakening in their attempts to push the man they demand to the post of Supreme Court.
George W. Bush telephoned the senators, lobbying them in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush and through him met with his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary at the time.
What happens if the FBI compiles its report?
The Senate will vote on it, and currently there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
However, it is not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which has allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the draw and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
North Korea's refugee numbers for Kim 'slowed'
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since the beginning of Kim Jong-un’s rule seven years ago, South Korean lawmakers say.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 refugees in the past year – up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park further said that there are stricter controls at the border between North Korea and China and higher rates of required smugglers at the border.
Pjongjang has not made any public statements about this.
The vast majority of refugees from the North are now receiving an offer of South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them run across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than in the heavily-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China looks at refugees as illegal migrants, not as refugees, and often necessarily repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are still technically in a state of war – have improved significantly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on halted denuclearization talks.
This was followed by a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the United States of not making any progress on the issue of sanctions.
“Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way for us to unilaterally let ourselves be disarmed,” Ri said in a speech before the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit for service at the Supreme Court because of her temperament.
Pelosi made this remark in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help myself, but if any woman ever performed such a theatre, they would call it ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh’s Thursday statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both still in puberty.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and suffocating when talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee and said their accusations against him were a “grotesque and coordinated attack” by organized liberals who were unable to pass themselves over the loss of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s statement proved that he was unable to work at the Supreme Court because he showed that he was preoccupied with Democrats.
“I think he himself disqualified from these statements and the way he relied on the Clintons and Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi answered in a negative way to the question of whether she would seek Kavanaugh's appeal in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll tell you this – if he’s not telling Congress the truth, then he’s not only eligible to work at the Supreme Court, but also at the court he’s working on now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she had concerns about the potential income of Kavanaugh in court under the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade because she is considered a conservative judge.
As part of a hearing of his previous confirmations in office, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question as to whether he would reverse some Supreme Court rulings.
“There’s no time for a hysterical, presumptuous person to go to court and expect us to just say, ‘Hey, that’s great,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to rule over it.
After the verbal outbursts, months and years, she couldn’t get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do I?”
She continues: “A woman helped me a lot, who was a director somewhere, and who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she created a certain technique. This means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person I was talking to, “Maybe she’s crying.
But I'm angry."
And so she went on.
And I think that's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of reaction to anger, in part because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office where men dominated. Once there I expressed my inexplicable anger with tears. But an older, always cold manager, whom I always sniffed for a little bit, was afraid
"Never tell them you're crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to have you."
Patricia Schroeder, once a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an unmarried affair aboard the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the fight, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," she told me with a laugh after 30 years.
“There were already seven more candidates, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "The Snowman and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had been going on for a long time, she was unable to keep up with her contributions, so she vowed not to let herself into the game unless she made $2 million in contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would give her only $250.
“Do you think I’ll get a discount?” she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally run the campaign, she was completely overwhelmed by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, a frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to make money and by focusing on voters rather than delegates and sex drive.
"Maybe you'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Schroeder said of how the press reacted to her.
“And maybe you would have thought that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they might write to me on a gravestone.
"Plakala"?
Why China-U.S. trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening salva of the trade war between the United States and China was deafening and although the battle is not far from over, experts say the gap between the countries in the long run is favorable for Beijing.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning this year by denouncing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
Most of the most significant escalations, however, saw the light of the world this week, when new tariffs on goods were announced for $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which practically means half of China’s trade exports to the US.
Beijing has responded every time, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to ten percent of the 60 billion imports of U.S. goods.
China has tried to pay the U.S. the same coin, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will collapse.
Even if China wanted Washington to return to its original ranks, it would have to backtrack on its demands, but public submission to U.S. demands would have been utterly humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Yet experts believe that if Beijing could play its cards correctly, the US trade war could positively support China in the long run, as it would reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
“The fact is that the rapid political decision of Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger economic turmoil in both countries. This is much more dangerous than ever before admitted by American observers,” said Abigail Security, a researcher at the Center for Research.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the U.N. General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today’s situation in the region is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas of the destroyed terrorists to a normal state.
Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are met, as well as the unilateral economic measures that have been aimed at their daily lives.
The UN estimates that Syria has left more than 5.5 million people since the start of the war in 2011.
The remaining six million people still live in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime welcomes any assistance in building a devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries sponsored by the rebels.
Europe responded to the victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Evria team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the edge of difficulty in France.
The United States has now lost sixth on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again won the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached 14.5 points, which were needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled most of the tour, then threw the ball into the water for 3 pairs of 16 holes and dropped the win to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari then glowed in all his circles and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best result 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest score, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
World's highest-rated player Dustin Johnson, he lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who apparently completed his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia has become the best European player overall with 25.5 points earned in his career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It was a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, I'm really happy I got the cup back.
It all depends on the team, I'm glad I could help," Garcia said after Europe's victory.
He gave the cup to his compatriot John Ramp, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
“I feel incredibly proud that I defeated Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching this guy,” Rahm said in a statement.
Woods lost all four games in France and now recorded a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Odd statistics of one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 of the biggest titles, which can only be compared to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finaua, who played top golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk, after his team's unsatisfactory results, said: "I'm proud of those guys, they really fought.
This morning we really warmed Europe to the heart.
We really couldn't do it.
I'm making a hat before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and move forward in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I could make them a captain.
I really need to get down.
You have defeated us.”
