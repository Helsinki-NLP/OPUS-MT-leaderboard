I didn't agree.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.

I'm over here.
Don't tell Tom what actually happened.
I'm not just going to give you this.
What are you gonna say then?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Get down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed these postcards to my friends.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I dropped the ball.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized in front of us.
He read this book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this photo?
Tom gave me both money and advice.
What do you want to hear from me?
Please, open the door.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
She married him at the age of twenty.
I can't give that dictionary to anyone.
Give me that box.
They say his father died in a foreign country.
Take mine.
I know Tom's above Mary.
I didn't have time to do it today.
Mary told Tom that she would help him.
The plural of "person" is "people", not "persons".
It's in two steps.
You ruined it!
I think Tom should have stayed in Boston.
Did you invite him?
Tom told me what the baby's name was.
Tom thinks I'm in Boston right now.
Tom didn't want to buy a new car.
We're teachers.
Tom will find you.
Everyone has weaknesses.
I hope you get paid well.
Tom didn't eat meat at all.
This book seemed interesting to me.
Hundreds of unemployed people sleep there day and night.
I guess I'll be late.
Do your children know French?
Tom screamed and ran out of the room.
This soup gives away the fish.
Lots of girls in the room.
He talks too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
Didn't you know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They tried to win the time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in a terrible way, from the point of view of the Jews, the Galilean dialect of the Aramaic language instead of the Hebrew, thus showing the inconsistency of claims about the existence of any sacred language, the use of which in the prayers of the individual.
In the end, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is a little different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
That's why they paid three hundred dollars for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
The weather forecast was not wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll ask Tom to prepare you something to eat.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom wasn't wearing a collar.
That's my answer!
I heard him sing in the shower.
You remind me of a young man.
Tonight, Tom's on duty.
I'm always busy.
I play a little piano.
I thought you were a ghost.
Tom got up quickly.
Please tell everyone that I'm sorry.
Tom told me to stay in his room.
Rest is important.
Have you called Lucy yet?
A good idea came to her mind at the last minute.
There's a lot of air in this room.
Why aren't you in the shower today?
The pound is a unit of weight.
I wouldn't talk to him if I were you.
Japan consumes a lot of paper.
It's very difficult.
You betrayed me.
Tell her I'm sick.
Tom seems to be very busy.
And I'm very happy to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.
I can't help Tom.
Is this my book?
Washing is a routine job.
Who else is on your list?
Don't give Tom my phone.
I've already decided who I'm going with.
I wish I knew what to tell them.
Tom's kids must be missing him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you need to talk to them.
He's reading physics in Oxford.
He hid this fact from me.
Did you save me?
He snorted loudly in his sleep.
What's your favorite browser?
Tom knew Mary by voice.
You don't even look at me.
Tom's too lazy to do that.
Please, stop arguing with me.
My grandfather always said there would be days to come like today.
I didn't tell her that.
I want to live in Australia.
No one could help them.
When did you meet her?
The day has come to an end. Thanks to your timely efforts, people who sought to help you in your work have not managed to put themselves in danger. In the Theatre, Masks are rehearsing a new pantomime.
After the earthquake, many people decided to sleep in tents on the street.
Tell your people to drop their weapons.
There is a secret door in the library.
Mike has friends in Florida.
We both laughed.
We need three more chairs.
I like this office.
I have a friend who lives in England.
Tom tries his best.
Why don't you come tomorrow?
We should get to know each other better.
Someone said something, but I didn't break it.
Someone has to talk to him.
I've never worried about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital on his own.
I was sitting next to Tom.
Your voice is upset.
Have you always been that selfish?
I think this medicine will be of great benefit to you.
Tell Tom to be here by the middle of the third.
This is not God’s knowledge of what science is.
Tom suspected that Mary was on drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it's gonna rain.
Would you like a beer?
Where'd you see him?
The poor cat was on the verge of starvation.
I’ve learned so much from my mistakes that I think I’ll do a few more!
My favorite color is blue.
I made some corrections.
You don't know what you're talking about.
The player hit the ball.
This book is selling well.
Tom didn't say anything.
I didn't know Tom wouldn't do that.
The positive atomic nuclei attract the negative electrons.
You're so wrong!
Tom opened his bag.
Everyone looked at my feet.
Tom was the first to arrive.
Don't help me, I want to do it myself.
I'm not good.
Come to me.
The hotel gave me an account of 8,000 yen per room.
I stopped trying to find fashion.
Tom's allergic.
I know this girl's father.
I don’t know what my kids want for Christmas.
Why did she do that?
Does Tom have it?
I finally got to work.
Tom in the kitchen, wash the dishes.
The temperature dropped by three degrees.
Tom refused to let Mary go to the party.
Tom won't ask me to do it.
I want to be like him.
I'll never tell you.
The bus was full.
Where do you want to go next weekend?
How great is that?
I've got a hangover.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car is selling well.
I need to work this weekend.
You can't do this to us.
His words bothered me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what Tom had to do.
Say hi to her from me.
Was that a lie?
Tom's response was overwhelming.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom in response?
It's time for me to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it in the store.
Peace is cruel.
I have a sensitive dream.
There is no one to care about, except yourself.
I'm from Sidhuoka.
Tom saw all the trees in the back yard.
Saturday is the day when you are free.
I wonder what happened to her.
The last bus leaves in 30 minutes.
He told me he'd do it.
He gave him a book.
Thank you so much for staying with me.
She didn't give me anything.
Eju, of course.
He wrote to his parents.
I'm happy with what I have.
What have you just come for?
A million miles.
I want to know if Tom and Mary are eating meat.
Tom wouldn't listen to my advice.
You want to say something to Tom?
You don't want another son?
How can I lose weight?
I think we should tell Tom we're gonna be late.
Where are our friends?
Don't forget us.
They were trying to hide their concern.
There is a large organ in this church.
I don't think you're right.
Did you find him?
You want me to come in?
Please put me on this side of the lighthouse.
Tom shot and killed a tiger.
I've never met anyone above me.
How much is the pain?
I'd like to drink something cold.
What's the difference?
Each nation has its own special character.
A healthy person does not know the price of health.
Did I miss something interesting?
I had to tell them myself.
The audience laughed.
You're not paying attention to me.
I have a broken ankle.
You like to take pictures, don't you?
He is a noble knight with no fear and no resistance.
They hate women.
I hardly have a pet with me.
Tom tried to run.
What color are her eyes?
Go on, hurry!
You overestimate him.
How many weeks ago did that happen?
Tom slept in his room.
Do you know why this is happening?
I looked around me.
Tom's still alive.
Hawaii is my favorite pizza.
Tom was a hockey fan.
Who was the first one here?
Do you sing in the choir?
You were home last night?
I was homeless for three months.
She said she wanted to win.
The prices will go down.
I'm glad Tom didn't hurt.
I've never hurt anyone.
It wasn't a coincidence.
Don't blame yourself.
What do you want to talk about?
Tom's yelling at Mary.
This is my favorite song.
Do not leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom used to say that Mary was from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very insightful.
Over and over again in our lives there are obstacles, some call them problems, others talk about opportunities for growth.
Thank you for taking him on a fishing trip.
You won't have this problem.
I prefer to spend time with my friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog barking in the woods.
He told me he wanted to leave the company.
You want to come in?
You and I both know it won't happen.
I thought you knew them.
Tom bought me a hot dog.
I'll be back late.
We need action, not words.
Tom suspected that he was a spy.
You're just running out of trouble.
A garden without women like a garden without flowers.
You can't leave the baby alone.
She'll do it if she can.
I'm done with it.
I put it on a spoonful of food.
Don't leave your glasses on the table!
We sold our souls for money.
Are you working tonight?
The wind blew.
I rarely met her.
I know it's really important.
I eat an apple.
Tom learns just as well as the other boys in his class.
I'm not hungry.
Their job is to prepare food for soldiers.
What if we get caught?
I can put things in the box.
I'm gonna clean up in your bedroom today.
He has five languages.
Tom had a difficult childhood.
I'm divorced.
How did you know Tom was sick?
I like the way you say my name.
Tom didn't say anything to me.
There's no tall guy in this class like Bill.
Shall we go?
I knew I could trust you!
Tom put the wood in the fire.
“Love has never killed anyone.” — “Did you? Ask Romeo and Juliet.”
What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It looks like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I couldn't let her go.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
I knew you'd be back.
These books are old.
Are we leaving yet?
Neither Tom nor Mary has ever been to Boston.
Have you ever had a salad?
If I had the money, I would buy a computer.
Tom's smiling?
She went to Paris.
Tom's in school now, right?
Let us know, please.
Tom nodded and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove that I'm wrong.
I told you to stay in my room.
Does it hurt somewhere?
He couldn't leave because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how it works.
Open the door, or we'll break it!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't give up French.
I think Tom can be trusted.
There are many mysteries in life.
Isn't it too salty?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's a rotten apple.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is Tom's favorite city.
It's sad when someone dies.
Are you feeling better now?
What makes you think we might be interested in this?
I'll think about you every day until I'm gone.
It was a bad bet.
The thought that she was going alone bothered me.
The river flows in size.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I've been watching them.
Do you really love her?
He gave a statement of facts without comment.
He was dark green.
He'll definitely come.
Is there a message?
I got a call from Tom yesterday.
We really need that.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the glasses.
I decided to give up.
The accident resulted in their only son being chosen.
Everyone knows that there is something new in this old city.
I'm always careful.
I went to the market.
Did you bring a towel?
Tell Tom I have his keys.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Do we have a chance to win?
I knew I had to stay home.
He understands it in French.
Tom sat on the bus going to Boston.
Turns out, she broke the lock.
I'm sick.
We'll talk to Tom later.
Do you want to be rich?
You're being called.
You both made a big impression today. I'm proud of you.
She doesn't like my manner of speaking.
Mary wants another child.
I don't care what you do with your money.
I'd like to see the boss.
Tom didn't drive to Boston by car.
You can’t rely on weather forecasts at all.
She's still young.
Have you listened to Tom’s advice?
Tom said he was a Dalton.
How's your father?
When did they say?
This car looks angry.
Do you study English?
Are you my enemy?
She asked him for some money for a new dress.
Why does the moon shine at night?
I couldn't understand anything Tom said.
You won't need it anymore.
Tom did it specifically.
Let's think about it.
I know Tom wants you to do it.
Tom said he didn't know anything about the robbery.
Are you familiar with everyone here?
Tom couldn't read until he was 13 years old.
I prefer scrambled eggs.
She lives in Mukhosransk.
Those people who aren’t smarter than me don’t care.
Is this your first visit to Australia?
The owls are wise.
Tom asked for some water.
The loser drove with a break in all three networks he gave.
I can't go with you because I'm very busy.
A kilogram of fig is two and a half euros.
Lots of animals in the zoo?

What's he talking about?
I haven't seen Tom in a long time.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
What floor does Tom live on?
There are no direct flights to Bologna from here.
I live outside the city.
Give me a few hours.
Don’t force yourself to eat if you don’t want to.
I have a warrant for Tom.
"How did the accident happen?" - "Nobody knows."
What do you like about it?
When I got to the station, I called my friend.
I need to buy a plane ticket to Moscow.
We met last week.
Don’t believe anything he says.
Tom got rid of his foreign accent.
We all knew it would happen sooner or later.
No one has expressed any disagreement.
She's running.
It's human.
If the Icelandic language were a color, I think it would be white.
Do you know where the meeting will take place?
I wish they were happy.
I want to quit my job.
Christianity has many followers.
The envelopes absorb the sound.
Tom told me it was impossible.
It must be the place where Tom lives.
Tom is a strange kid.
The phone was invented by Bell in 1876.
I fell asleep on his shoulder.
I know you work a lot.
I love Ural languages.
I hope you're wrong about that.
Sometimes you have to tell the truth.
Tom's a tough guy.
I have an offer for you.
Did she like dinner?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are planning on getting married on October 20.
If you want to be alone, I'll leave.
He has a lot of talent.
He's in a bad mood.
What would you like to be called?
He has a Japanese father.
Who would want to kill him?
I was in a hurry.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was exhausted.
He's studying until late at night.
Tom's room is very small.
Do you speak Italian?
The girl smiled at me.
This song is doomed to success.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we know.
I'm proud of them.
I just got home.
Tom burns in his oven both wood and coal.
My eyes are hurting.
I love stories.
We have to be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom dropped his keys to Mary.
I talk to him all the time.
I can't help but laugh at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God foretold the union of royal authority and priesthood in Jesus Christ.
You want me to talk to Tom myself?
Each of us went to his home.
The thread is thin but strong and does not rust.
It's all a little silly.
Right now I don't know what I want.
That's incredible.
I don't think you sent me that order.
Six to five in favor of TV viewers!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom is interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.
Was he really that bad?
Tell me, please, where you're going to live.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
That's Tom's voice.
Can we get Tom?
Tom said I wasn't beautiful.
Do you cry often?
We did not expect such results.
I've read this before.
If the car breaks down, we'll walk.
Can I touch your hair?
Did we find anything interesting?
They're all doing it.
I often go to visit relatives.
He will be expelled from our club.
You must be punished for what you did.
They went up the stairs.
She needs to drink water.
It's one of the most ugly buildings I've ever seen.
The robber broke into the post office in the middle of the day.
That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come too.
With God's help...
I don’t like coffee too much.
My old table.
We're both very busy.
The dark is invisible.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll go get you.
Tom tried to drown in the bathroom.
Tom and I grew up together.
I said good-bye.
Tom is Maria’s younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes to play cards.
The book is big.
Don't talk like that about Tom.
I seem to have made myself clear.
We've been waiting for three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Times can change, but human nature is the same.
Tom seems to be very upset about something.
I brought a cookie.
Next year, Tom will be teaching French.
I listened to her until the end.
I advised Tom to rest.
Why does it make you angry?
The worst part of the trip is already behind.
We'll miss you both.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her on the shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do that!
I really liked this knife.
How do you know what I had?
It'll only take you a minute.
I would very much like to change this situation.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They won't come back.
You don't have to believe any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a protein in a wheel.
He's never experienced that.
Don't you want to come with us?
Does Tom know how to swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We plan to leave as soon as possible.
He went skiing on Hokkaido.
“Close your music and read the book.” — “I see, my censoring spell is still working!”
You knew her better than I did.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There is no salvation for her.
I'm sorry I did this without you.
You've got blood coming out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants the same as you do.
We can't just ignore it.
Where did you and Tom meet?
Where is the supermarket near here?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't know Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you're fake, join us.
Tom wanted to ask Mary's forgiveness again.
Tom was thoughtful.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He's never been there.
I'd really like to go with you, but I can't.
It's never happened before.
I wasn't going to do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Hurry up, or you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary changed places.
How do they take you?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful person, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is threatened.
Mary sewed Alice a new dress.
This decision was difficult to make.
I thought you'd like a drink.
I got what you asked for.
He said he'd do it.
That's why I didn't have to leave.
Mary was healed after the illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get this?
Eating meat will harm your health and the environment.
You're telling me you don't know anything about it?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom can't enjoy life.
I want you to say a word for me.
No one loves me.
I'm sorry I don't know Tom's phone.
"Tom knows." "Yes, did you tell him?" "No, he knew it himself."
Your explanation was very clear.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand it in French.
I'm just sure you've just been thinking about something.
Sugar is the world’s largest source of dust.
What do you like the most about Boston?
I want to be alone.

I told them not to tell anyone.
We have a lot to buy.
I read an interesting book yesterday.
Tom's gonna pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is the crying one.
I don't have this book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is at the center of the solar system.
Are you a police officer?
Tom led both me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut the razor.
Tom and Mary seem to be more than just friends.
The river ran down the garden.
A strong wind at night.
Ants and giraffes are distant relatives.

I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need him.
Tom's got two suitcases.
Tom didn't seem to know me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Look, don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I'm used to getting up early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom's in the office.
All Tom's doing is watching TV.
Tom's in a good mood today.
It's the most delicious peas of all I've ever eaten.
I had a parking problem.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do that.
She's not mine.
You know what that is?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Tom was never late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go to your father and ask him.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each letter.
You're hard to take seriously.
Members of this tribe moved along the river.
I'll do it.
I said let them go.
When's the start?
No one is interested in what she thinks.
I don't think that's weird at all.
"Where did you get my phone?" "Tom gave."
When are you going to clean the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Does it make sense to do that?
Why are you closing the door?
Tom said he tried to do it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at eight o'clock in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You can't write programs.
Change the subject.
I love to travel around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom is low, but strong.
It's cold this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She made dinner.
Find me, please, Tom.
He'll give it to you.
This proposal is not clearly written.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
What, you don't understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
You think you're fat?
Tom got divorced from Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is endless!
This box weighs a ton. What's inside?
He gets it all because he's a juggler.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
It looked like he was going to kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
You having fun?
This is unlikely to happen.
I'll order it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
Yesterday I was free all day, and today I work.
Take your coat, it's cold today.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a terrible man!
Cardboard is stronger than paper.
Don't be mad at him.
You've exceeded your powers.
The curse was destroyed.
Tom's grandfather was born blind.
Tom's above you, isn't he?

I've heard of all your problems.
I've known him for a year.
I'm going with you to Boston.
Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer, they went to the mountain resort.
Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary are not afraid.
Can you get closer?
She's a little shy.
What actions do you expect from Tom?
She seemed to be completely calm.
Press the button.
Tom went with Mary to the museum.
Tom was intrigued by what was going on.
Mary was wearing knee-length shoes.
It's a lie.
I'll follow them.
She said it was cold.
The road inspector was very rude.
Tom wants to follow in his father's footsteps.
I don't see any problems here.
I don't have to do it tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It's awfully bitter.
Tom told you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on the way to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Last time, Tom was the first.
They're all different.
I need to see you.
I lost your phone.
Put a tree out there.
Do you usually wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom's gonna fix it.
Tom said good-bye to his sister.
My mother was busy preparing dinner.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Small pots have long handles.
Tom was in the sandals.
There's a bench under the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How do you like my story?
Tom turned off the alarm and went back to sleep.
Tom and Mary looked tired.
I heard you sing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?

You bought too much bread.
He says he doesn't plan to go.
I have two dogs, three cats and six chickens.
Does Tom have a cable?
Whatever you say, I won't change my mind.
Tom can talk.
Thank him for his help.
Tom could have told me.
This will bring misfortune to your family.

Let's go!
Do this until it's dark.

You're upset.
Yesterday, my granddaughter was born.
Tom's costume is a pirate.
This is pure truth!

Tom should be here in 15 minutes.

I'll get you out.
We are proud of our achievements.
So I had to invite Mary.

You have to get up early.
Nothing bad has happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He put on a black coat.
I forgot to paint the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't stay in this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?

I'd like to talk to her again.

His bag was badly damaged.
He was injured when he fell.
We're unbiased.

I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Do you follow your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her not to be in my house.
You probably won't be able to do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.

Do you have an opinion?
Do you like these spirits?

I have three French-English dictionaries.
Put it down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.

To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How'd you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.

I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
That's why you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary take things to the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom unwittingly gave Mary the money she asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I was trying to solve the problem.
You should've done your homework.
I was talking on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
As it turns out, it will respond.

The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How can we explain this to children?
I didn't even know your names.
The monkey fell on a tree.
The language I am learning is very difficult.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom does?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Are you really living alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom is the youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We would like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president has four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!

Can't you solve this?
Both Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
The building has 20 floors.
If you don't go, I won't either.
You don't happen to know when Tom's coming back?
I don't have any pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a bit?
Are you going to give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I’ll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would now be a rich man.
I made this decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
How much do you plan to be home in the evening?
The bag's empty.
Do you feel normal?
He's as stubborn as an ass.
I think you can be trusted.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a sense that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You are never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but I took some girl's tube.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very strict with the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He was preparing for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom was interested in that.
I'm mixing mayonnaise with ketchup.
They always complain.
Tom's got some snacks.
Do you understand what she said?
You're kind of distracted.
Don't hurt her.
I'd better stay.
That’s why I came up with a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect Tom needs to go to Boston next week.
Don't walk on someone else's land.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face was red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
We need a new curtain in the room.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's sleeping.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
How much do you want to leave?
Her legs hurt.
This is a risk we cannot afford.
Can you give me a minute? I want to discuss something that's important to both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do that often.
I hope we don't do that anymore.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I would be happy.
I almost believe you.
These gems are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, there will be a time of discovery.
I'm not sure what her size is.
He was also good with animals.
Tom and I had a drink together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll leave as soon as the rain stops.
Foma left the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help but think of Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary had been poisoned.
Who doesn’t admire them?
We were crying with him.
Don't you want to try again?
Hold on a second.
What did you break up with?
From milk you can make oil, cheese and much more.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
You're her relative?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug the well.
Did you know that Tom has a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her younger daughter.
Behave yourself well.
You like jazz, don't you?

Look at him.

Get yourself a decent suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
That's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?

Who sent this letter?
Drop the gun.
What happened to the money?

You won't find them.
Tom was the only one who survived.
Are you going to buy this car?
You're talking like my grandmother.
I don't have any relatives.
Let's see something else.
Do you think this is an accurate translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both really wanted to eat.
So there's nothing to do here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop right here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
You have to take his age into account.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you don't like pizza.
Tom began to suspect that something was wrong.
What if he comes back now?
If you are tired, sleep!
I'm afraid I won't have time.
You didn't know Mary was Tom's wife?

They slept in the car because they couldn’t find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She has a double chin.
We cannot force the people to do so.
Let's take her.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand that color.
Do they sleep together?
We are very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's not married yet.
I didn't even know what you knew.
I won't let her in.
The neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I've never spoken to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She also has flaws.
I wonder why Tom needs it.
That seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing on Friday night?
Tom's not the only one from Boston.
Will you support me?
What do you not like about this plan?

What color are you associated with your childhood?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.

You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of the half-doomcrat.
I'd like to heal.
Borrow me some notes or something like that.

I won't make that mistake again.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I told her to marry him.
I've been waiting my whole life for this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane went into the pier.
It wasn't him.
Do you have friends by mail in Indonesia?
You may have to help her.
Mary has lost consciousness.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had the time, I'd be happy to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You are photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let’s talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hi," Tom said softly.
Where are you?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have any food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
In attack!
Look at the price tag.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new proposal as a message in a bottle: someday it will be translated.
You won't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
We are soul mates with him.
I have a granddaughter of your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She began to work in her new office.
Let us take care of it.
I think you're sitting in my place.
I planned to do it yesterday.
It's a little early to drink alcohol, isn't it?
My parents don’t like the way I dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
It'll be interesting.
I hit him hard and hard.
Because it's worse?
It's cheap.
Can I take your hand?
He's green.
I heard a lot of noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom didn't make it all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about cellulite.
The series should start watching when all the seasons are over!
Road accidents happen on a daily basis.
Where did you go to go skiing?
You were in the hairdresser's?
The prospect is exhausting.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ballpoint pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I didn't sleep for two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You need to find another way out of this situation.
Disappear.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let’s all take pictures together.
I failed the exam.
Everyone already knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The football player made a huge mistake.
Will they come too?
She sleeps like a baby.
Tom forgot to let go of the brakes.
This song reminds me of a girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The explosion shook the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hugged.
That's my cat.
Do you already have children?
Tom didn't want breakfast.
They like Tom.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a self-assured idiot.
It doesn't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I think you need some help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Release the cat.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom believes that throwing away food is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place bends to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom about this before?
I'll never listen to you again.
I have no doubt about it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom threw the whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
I haven't seen him before.
How much did he cost?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
The sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I was before.

It's just amazing.
He said he would never do that.
The thief will also steal the cow.
Tom doesn't swim very well, does he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was only a shadow of the former.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom doesn't really want to go with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
It's all happening.
What day is today?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm an ordinary guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Is that true? Did Paul kiss Lily in the lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he'd come with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I need to stay together.
I've only heard good things about him.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You can't compare yourself to us.
I saw the car explode.
The window's here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'm never gonna throw out my Pleasty.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV show?
Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's bag is empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll be lost.
I love going to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank you for your son.
I think her father is a lawyer.
I want to see a volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
You can't do anything about it.
Tell Tom I'm going to go to his house tonight.
They need you.
It's orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer put courage in his men.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying something like that right now.
I don't know much about hunting.
This is my first time making grilled meat at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many umbrellas do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
This was already known to everyone.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You don't have to lie.
I know Tom's crying right now.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe that's what she said.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him look at you.
Tom was sceptical.
Tom should be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the police his driving license.
I'm stretching every month.
I told you, I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an apple acid.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalogue.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
Are you taking a job at home?
According to mythology, Prometheus stole the sacred fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All the passengers managed to get out of the bus before it burned down.
I want to help you figure this out.
You speak French better than I do.
There are a lot of talented people in our city, but Tom doesn't belong to them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We accept cheques.
My bike's gone.
The stars swirled in the night sky.
I doubt Tom will win.
"What is it?" "What are you doing here?" "What are you doing here?" "What are you doing here?" "What are you doing here?" "How are you doing?" "How are you doing?" "How are you doing?" "How are you doing?" "How are you doing?" "How are you doing?" "How are you doing?" "How are you doing?" "How are you doing?" "How are you doing?" "How are you doing?"

It's not a bug.
I don't want to scare you.
Tom told me Mary didn't want to go.
Have you talked to the doctors yet?
No one's seen that.
Mary is an outstanding artist.
I think he's right.
Everyone loves money.
They were lost in the forest.
When was the last time you ate?
I have a heartache.
My father doesn't let me go to a movie alone.
I saw the boat sinking.
Instead of going to work, I stayed home all day.
I'll support you.
I didn't talk to Tom.
They decided to work harder.
It's not for sale.
Who are your neighbors?
My dad usually watches TV after dinner.
He's drinking wine.
Please cut yourself an apple pie, I've made it for you.
I don't think Tom understood the question.
You have to stop her.
You'll make it on time if you get out now.
There were no problems with Tom.
The darkness did not hide it.
I invited him over for dinner.
I'm sure finding a place will be easy.
I took two aspirin pills from my headache.
You're in my heart.
He took me to the last drop.
Don't laugh!
Love is not to blame for anyone.
If you come to Tom now, you'll probably be watching his TV.
I saw you in the park with Tom.
I didn't mean to offend them.
I'd better go find them.
My motorcycle broke down on the road.
Tom made a selfie without a shirt.
In whose kingdom was this church built?
Soon we'll be able to put you in jail.
I'm starting to think you're serious.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sure Tom would be happy to help.
It's Joanna.
I've made so many mistakes.
How can people do such things?
That's why I'm really sorry.
I like your glasses.

I always thought Tom was a close friend.
I'm one of those girls who's best friends with guys.

I didn't want to swim.
He drank beer.
In today's world, it's hard for a man to be... himself.

I'm squeezing my nose plates.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all kids.
She came out and yelled at me.
Have you taken your medicine?
The rabbits are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
Time is on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Did you want to tell me something?
I doubt Tom's still mad.
You'll be better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you feel the smell of a burning rubber?
That's not what happened here.
When's your father coming home?
I get it.

I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of the shower.

I've already talked to this student.
What is the chemical sign of hydrobromic acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

So we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do it.
Cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a gentleman.
I respect his views, although I disagree with many of them.
Skyscraper is located in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him up with a sweater.
I don't think Tom wants to go with you to Boston.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
Is it cheaper to call after nine?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't go back to school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
Do you plan to stay long?
We ate quickly and left right away.
Behind the house there is a large garden.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't roll anything on your feet.
Start each meal with the soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He was sitting right in front of me.
The cage was open.
I brought the wine.
I'm unpopular.
It was his first day at school.
I want to see you before I die.
She's beautiful too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest a different strategy?
They died.
Apples are big.

That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I am a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
Are you looking for this book?
It should have been you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you eat?
You don't know her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning on doing this or not.
I'm falling.
I was unable to come on his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing a new shoe.
Last year, she learned to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
You don't have to thank me.
Since it was winter, he did not go out.
Walking down the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses on your street?
The elephants are made of ivory.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"How's life, Mike?" "My name is Tom."

What, they said, happened?
Can't you leave the door open?
We'll have to wait for that.

The rain's gone, you can open the windows again.
I've never had anything like this before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was going out when I called the phone.
I don't have to endure it.
Always give up the right-hand side of the road.
They're asking us to introduce ourselves.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like the rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can kick you if you want.
Tom told Mary that she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I've never asked her.
Nothing relaxes as much as a hot bath.
I really don't have that much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There is an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about that.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice like a melodic siren song to me.
What's it like to be married?

You are so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Treat him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.

Tom used to meditate every morning as a rule.

What's your brother doing?
We need a volunteer.

I'd like to hear from you, please.
I'll wait for his arrival here.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.

You yourself are to blame for what happened.
It's just like clockwork.
I know where you're going.
You're taking it all in the summer.
Let's get him down.
Let's leave it until tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.

Is it snow?
I'll call you back.
He lowered the glass.
I don't know if there is a country in the world where you can marry your dog.

I'm glad he didn't hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French at all.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen knife was not sharp enough to cut the meat, so I took advantage of my wig knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.

Keep a bucket of water next to it.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We're all set.
The river is deep here.
I thank you with all my heart.
I've told you this a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
