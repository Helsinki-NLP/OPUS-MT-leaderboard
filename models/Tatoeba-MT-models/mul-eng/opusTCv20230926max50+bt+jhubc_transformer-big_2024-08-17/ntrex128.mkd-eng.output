Members of the Welsh National Assembly are concerned that "they look like maps"
Some of the members of the assembly are surprised by the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that it may be a laughing matter.
A member of the Labour party’s assembly said his party was concerned that it was “robbering with Twp and Pwp.”
For those who don’t speak Welsh: the Welsh twp means “stupid/crazy”, and the pwp means “how”.
A member of Plaid said the party as a whole was "not happy" and offered alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said his party was "free-minded" about the name change, but noted that the similarity of the words MWP and "mapet" was great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a name change law, said: "The final decision on any words with which the members of the assembly will be appointed, of course, will be made by the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of the public consultations on proposals that indicated great support for the appointment of the assembly as the Parliament of Great Britain.
On the question of the name of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the greatest support from public consultations.
Members of parliament are proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach a consensus could cause headaches for the Speaker of the House, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on the changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on disqualification of members of the Assembly and design for the committee system.
The members of the assembly will give the final vote on the question of their name when they discuss the law.
The Macedonian people will vote in a referendum to change the name of the country.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote was put in an attempt to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a legal claim on its territory and has consistently opposed the country’s attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscite to change the name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to be paid for entering the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bell rang as churches in Harlem faced problems
“Historically, the old people I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr Adams said.
“Today, there will be neither one nor the other.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People are socializing differently today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer living rooms in neighborhoods where people go on a regular basis.”
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, “and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced with residential buildings full of type of people who would not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
“Most of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are white,” he said, “and that’s why the day these churches will be closed completely will accelerate because it’s unlikely that most of the people who settle in those apartments will become members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by congregations of the Whites before Harlem became the Blacks’ metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original Congregation of White Methodists moved in the 1930s.
The congregation of blacks who practice their faith nearby takes over the ownership of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the congregation of blacks during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of vendors at 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, which refused to employ or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bell of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it "cultural wealth" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriveter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part brought by the inexperienced leaders of the church, and part of the episcopal diocese.
The Church Board – the governing body of the church, composed of inexperienced leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese “will require the expenses to be transferred” to the Church Board, although the Church Board was not involved in the recruitment of parishioners and parishioners.
Some members of the parish complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
A shark injures a 13-year-old child while diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for bait in California on the day of the opening of the bait season, the authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Bicon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB television in San Diego that he was diving with friends about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help and then rushed to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hammel stated that he first thought it was an excitement to catch a single, but then “he realized that he was shouting, ‘I’m late!
I'm late!"
The whole key bone was looking at him," Hammel said that he noticed after reaching the boy.
“I called for everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hamel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to a children's hospital in Rady, San Diego, where he was taken into critical condition.
It is not known what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a few weeks earlier a shark had been spotted in the area, but they decided that the shark was not of a dangerous species.
Gils added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Authorities closed the beach from the side of Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of warehouses full of professional assistants.
As part of the significant entry into the UK beauty market that weighs 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as fashion and household sales decline, the large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country.
The investment in beauty has emerged after supermarkets began looking for ways to exploit the space of shelves that was once intended for televisions, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty product offering for the first time to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its own series of boutique make-up, so that most of the products are suitable for vegans, something that is increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
In addition, the fragrance merchant Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Creedon, south London, last week, and the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Cup, Sainsbury's director, said the stores will increasingly look like warehouses because the supermarket chain is trying to fight off the discounted Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's began to put Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which they said increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but the collaboration ended after disagreement over how to split profits from chemical stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was said to play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Commercial Director, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a must-have destination for beauty that provokes the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones is ‘crazy’ after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Star Peter Jones of Dragons Den has gone "crazy" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Wiloubi doesn't have time for their Truly brand of household products and accessories.
The couple's business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This 37-year-old morning show host told Instagram she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, retreating from their profitable lifestyle-branded business at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “crazy” when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals — worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million — meant that she was no longer producing.
The business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was said to double Willowby's wealth to an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As 37-year-old Willoughby said on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left the UK on one of his weekends.
A source said: “Trily has always been at the top of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would follow her over the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all those affected caught them absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
At Marlow’s headquarters, there is a warehouse full of products that are ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of this morning’s program leader, who is one of Britain’s highest-paid stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in products from pillows and candles, to clothing and household products, and due to the potential for domestication.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willowby, a mother of three, and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willouby is set to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of ITV’s “I’m a Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said yesterday, “We’re not commenting on his business exploits.”
A serious conversation “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he would get from the media for commenting that some would consider “unpresidential” and because it is so positive for North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump said with his voice translated as a "news presenter".
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump rated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization negotiations have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's early moves to devastate North Korea.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump takes a much more optimistic look at his speech at the rally.
“We strongly agree with North Korea,” he said.
“We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
“We have a great collaboration now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results – they ended missile tests, helped free hostages, and the remaining U.S. soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we’ll have 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd ahead of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and took hundreds of lives
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok was resettled, no basic weather was declared, which is a prerequisite for international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not seek international assistance, so it is a challenge,” Mr. Sumbung said.
Although “Save the Children” is a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Due to the earthquakes that constantly hit Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coasts.
The apparent lack of siren for tsunami warning in Palu, although a warning was issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
At the best time, traveling through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters are making logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake has headed for Pal, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
A key point in President Joko Vidodo’s election campaign was the improvement of Indonesia’s old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and tracks.
But the lack of funds included Mr. Yoko’s administration in the eyes of the re-election next year.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other old weapons.
Watch: Daniel Starridge of Liverpool team equals Chelsea against Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri handed the ball to Starridge about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1–0.
He moved the ball to the left before heading for the distant statue.
The ball was moving high above the sixteenth as it turned to the right corner of the net.
The ball eventually passed through the jumper Cape Arizabagaga and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shak always give as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible,” Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching and I just touched her and I didn’t think much about it and I just joked.”
Chelsea led 1–0 in halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker gave a fifth back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> in that attack, before shooting the ball almost half the field, and then sprinted to the half of Liverpool.
They quickly made their way with Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D> in the middle of the field.
He then directed a projectile, leading Hazard to the sixteenth.
Hazard passed the defense and finished in the far-off stat grid with a left-footed shot alongside Alison Becker at Liverpool.
Liverpool will compete against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that fell in the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit Friday and caused waves at a height of 20 feet, a spokesman for Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told a news conference.
The town of Pal<0xC3><0xBA>, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was hit by a shot from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
An investigation into the murder has begun after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The forty-four-year-old woman was found dead at 7:55 a.m. with injuries to Grayson Mows on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who saw or heard something to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: “The investigation is in its early stages, but I would have asked people who were near John Street in Birkenhead, who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the cameras of the cars to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.”
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a facility.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, as the police said, they will inform the victim's close people.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mows just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that no entry or exit from the building was allowed.
He was left speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will be hours before they can return.
Someone heard a police officer telling a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
There was a woman dressed in tears.
She kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were on the border, and another one was outside.
A number of police officers were standing at the border and watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime Fighters on 0800 555 111 citing a record 247 of September 30.
Cromwell’s statue of parliament has become the latest memorial hit in the so-called “rewriting of history” <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s proposal as “crazy” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure in front of Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclast of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for the deeds of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Cromwell's wonderful presentation of Sir William Hamo Torneycroft is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of the figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many consider, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is a fully accurate performance is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning.”
Pork-killer disperses and kills Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the surname "Juan", was found dead with a skin artery, covered in blood near a market stall in Liupanshui, South China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to put vaccines on pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining, in the province of Kinghai, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found an open door in the neighboring pig car.
He said that there was a large snake in the carriage with the blood of the mutt.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that the 550-pound sledgehammer broke the farmer and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's bed was bloody and torn," said the cousin, given the nickname "Wu", according to a quote in the evening news in Guyana.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to either John or his cousin.
A market manager told evening news that the pig had been locked up to prevent an attack on other people, while police gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have also been reports of cases of pigs being attacked by humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a <0xC2><0xA3>650 pig stuck a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife dumped the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood may act as an “activator.”
“They’re just playing.”
They want to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone intentionally.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rain to the southwestern part of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves through the cold waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring rainfall floods to the northern part of Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane of 5.00 a.m. east time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, depression is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Lower California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to bring large tropical rain to the north-west.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture with the approaching depression will create abundant rainfall in the southeast over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden flooding, a flood of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical rain will cause rainfall, which in some places will be about 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible due to the rapidly deteriorating conditions that are due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It is especially recommended not to walk in the desert on foot in the possibility of tropical rain.
The occasional rain can cause the canyons to become stormy rivers, and the thunderstorm will bring local strong winds and dust.
The impending depression will bring locally-poor rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rain can be a total of more than half an inch, which can cause rivers of debris and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since their wet season.
Occasionally, tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early in the morning on Monday, before the rain expands later on Monday and Tuesday.
The occasional rain will spread to the “four corners” on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected throughout the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, but tropical regions remain at high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will be seen in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There are almost 20 degrees of difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to re-create and expand.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm beginning of October with high temperatures at 80 degrees from the southern plains to the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates the possibility of average temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States, all the way to the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Kavanaugh’s audition.
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony on Thursday of the nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, and the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christina Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the escalating political situation continued, with speakers interrupting regular retaliatory programs at the last minute of Friday: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona has signed an agreement with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Cavano had picked up the piano and tried to get her to wear a high school party suit.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
More than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen reported, were likely to watch it on Friday.
The company counted average viewings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for the other networks they were showing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people who watch in offices.
To show itself better, it is an audience of similar size as for a playoff match in football or the awards of the film academy.
The Fox News channel, whose leaders strongly attacked the appointment of Kavanaugh, led in front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said in a statement.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Blake was a central figure in the Friday drama.
After the Republican office moderately released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras captured him as protesters calling for him on Friday morning as he tried to enter the court committee's hearing elevator.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes as he was being overworked, all of which was broadcast live on CNN.
"They're standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth on earth?"
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator door, that there would be more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable and radio networks all covered hours later, when the court committee was supposed to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination in the Senate to vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider the charges against the nominee next week, which was requested by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After the conversation with Kuns, and with a few senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was of great importance, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" in connection with Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with Britain's future and undermine national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party's conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview immediately with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called “Chekers” plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should “collect the spoils of war.”
Shooting at Wade Sims: Police Arrest Suspected Ditton Simson for Death of Sportsman at Louisiana State University
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Diton Simpson has been arrested and taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder, the Batton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the shooting.
Police found the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS' WAFB partner said.
After being interrogated by Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting at Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The office of the pathologist of the parish of East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head towards the neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, the South University Police Department, and the aid workers they gave in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for her “activity in search of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6.6-foot duck grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 touchdowns per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the Louisiana State University basketball team, Will Wade, said the team had been "destroyed" and "shocked" by Sims' death.
"This is what you care about without interruption," the coach said.
Volcano toppled ash over Mexico City
The eruption of ash from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern settlements of Mexico's capital city.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go down the volcano after it began activity in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center followed several tremors and tremors.
Social media images show a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City's populated areas, such as Sochimilko.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity of the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Gojo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the police for public order and peace and thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote to secede.
A group of masked supporters of separatists detained by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint into powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
Later in the day they also blew up carpets, and the police used the sticks to tighten the carpets.
For more than a few hours, the independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness", and on the other hand, the union protesters chanted "Long Live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, a local press release said.
Tensions continue to be high in the region that wants independence, a year after Madrid characterized the October 1 referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by the separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although the exit was small due to the boycott by people who opposed the split.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police forcibly tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region.
The independence groups camped through the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narciss Termes, who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia had a chance of gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they can vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having won a vital but narrow victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties struggled to keep up the momentum this year with many of their best-known leaders either in self-selected persecution or in detention waiting for trial in their wake.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, recording the protest in support of the police, said the conflict was backed by politicians from both sides.
“Everything is becoming more and more powerful,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in prison before a trial last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londoners Arrested After Car Crashing in Home <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly shooting a car at a London house.
The incident took place in Balinagar Crescent on Thursday at around 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said the damage to the gate and the building itself had been caused.
At some point, he could be hit by a self-propelled gun to the car.
Menga's match brought Livingston a 1–0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
The improved Livingston scored the Rangers with the signing of Stephen Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 games, as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved to be significant as Gary Hold's side climbed to a level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's side remained undefeated in the tournament season and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind them by eight points.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston continue to be undefeated in the division in six games, and coach Holt has not yet faced a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed the chance against the harsh guests.
Holt's team had to lead for a long time before they scored, and their directness caused a lot of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried, but he pulled the attack around the goal, then Alan Litgov could only direct his efforts away after slipping away he played a hit with Craig Halket's head over the goal.
The guests were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems with the assigned actions.
And that’s how the final goal came.
The Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingston received an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together set up Menga, who only touched a goal from the center of the sixteenth.
By that time the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball but were unable to break through the defense of the hosts, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unplayable.
The scheme continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos was instrumental in the rescue of Kelly.
Scott Pitman failed to score due to the skill of Ranger goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgow took the ball away from another set action at Livingston.
Livingston's sixteen-year-old was constantly passing by and was constantly defended, while two penalty demands - after Halket's challenge for Glen Middleton's replacement and one for hand play - were rejected.
“Fenomenal” by Livingston – analysis
Aladdin Lamont at BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and result for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to exceed the expectations of this uphill trail.
Their style and character of playing barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the merit goes to Holt for the way the team has been galvanizing since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still held Conor Goldson and Joe Voral on standby.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they once were under Gerard's leadership, they now lag behind with the same standards.
Their last game was weak – they only managed to open the hosts once – and that was a little awareness of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day since President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They got worse because of problems that included human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then heads to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurdish, also made statements, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opponent protesters portray the visitor's division as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident on the road in Deptford: cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The clash took place near the intersection of the streets of Westwood and Evelyn, a high-traffic highway in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city at about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The collision occurred a few months after the death of another cyclist in a road accident on Childers Street, where the driver fled, about a mile from the collision on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working on identifying the man and informing his family.
Roadblocks are set up and buses are rerouted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Trouble
Six police officers were injured in a riot in a high-security male prison, the prison’s office said in a statement.
The riots erupted at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from the Tornado unit were brought to resolve the unrest, which included eight prisoners and were confined to a single wing.
Officers are being treated for minor injuries on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison said: “Specially trained prison personnel were instructed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible for it will be handed over to the police and may spend additional time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was announced that the governor of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the police for public order and peace were called to the prison to deal with serious riots in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (it may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely happens to hit Arizona, but that’s likely to happen early next week when the remaining strength of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwestern region, bringing the risk of sudden flooding.
The state weather station has already issued warnings of possible acute flooding for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, all the way to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Lexus, and Lagos.
Rosa is expected to move on a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late on Monday with rain.
The state weather station in Phoenix reported on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have retained the status of a tropical storm or depression in the range of 200 miles on Phoenix since 1950!
Catherine (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the State Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches at the edge of Arizona’s Mongolia.
Other areas of the desert southwestern region, including the central parts of the Carpathian Mountains and the Great Basin are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those who are out of risk areas for acute flooding, the Rosa rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to be beneficial because the southwestern region is hit by drought.
According to the U.S. drought watchdog, nearly 40 percent of Arizona faces extreme drought, the second-highest category.”
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa led to landslides all over Mexico’s Lower California Peninsula.
Rosa, still with a hurricane strength on Sunday morning with winds of a maximum of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes in contact with colder waters in the Pacific and decreases.
Therefore, rain is expected in Mexico with a magnitude of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
Rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of flooding.
“It is expected to rain 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to Northwest Sonora, with possible maximum 10 inches of rain,” the weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours on Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and in the south of the South until late evening hours on Tuesday.
“The main danger that is expected from Rosa or her remains is the very abundant rains in Lower California, southwestern Sonora and the desert southwestern region of the United States,” the State Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening floods and torrents of debris, as well as landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsamer Northon attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in Midsamer Northon's Excelsior Terrace area around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and is in a “stable” condition.
One 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police said.
The police asked if anyone had any photos of the phone from the incident, to stand out.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "suffering the Democratic Party's greatest anger and anger."
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s harshest and most scandalous tactics,” Trump said at a meeting in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "suffering the Democratic Party's greatest anger and anger" during his nomination.
Cavano testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christina Blasey Ford that he had committed a sexual assault on her a few decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford testified to the interrogation and to her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "the Americans saw the brilliance, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“The positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke of the significance of the Republicans' exit from the early elections.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
"I'm not running, but I'm really struggling," he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere and I’m fighting for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats have a mission to “resist and prevent.”
The first key vote for Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate is expected no later than Friday, the GOP's senior director told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the total number of victims has increased.
At least 384 people were killed, many carried away by the huge waves hitting the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Pal<0xC3><0xBA> on Friday when waves of 6 meters (18 feet) high hit the coast of the sunset, leading many to safe death and destroying everything on their way.
After the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5, it hit a tsunami.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and didn’t run immediately, so they became victims,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB agency for mediation in Indonesia’s Jaffa disaster.
“The tsunami didn’t come on its own, it dragged cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the mainland,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was traveling across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pal<0xC3><0xBA>.
Air photos published by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, overturned and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the energy released by the atomic bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coastline, is likely to strengthen the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as “broad” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be increased along the 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongal, Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami hit Pal, although authorities said the waves came about at about the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of a building can be heard screaming insanely, warning people on the street down about the approaching tsunami.
In a few minutes, a wall of water jammed on the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Ritters couldn't confirm the footage right away.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Pal, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated people still desperately need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was reopened only for help and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Vidodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's really bad.
As World Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees were stranded in cerebus shelters in the courtyard of their office, they passed through the desert scenes on the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even as aid groups began the dark attempts to launch aid for the disaster, some complained that foreign aid experts had been prevented from traveling to Pal<0xC3><0xBA>.
According to Indonesian law, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the site of the accident has been declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a provincial-level disaster,” said Auliya Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international aid, but there is still no status.”
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of the missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracle that would ease the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who was stabbed to death for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian state paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended at the beginning of the month in Indonesia.
The others who were stuck in the Roa Roa hotel, added Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior in the paragliding field, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told how, when she started circulating news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse in the paraglider community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to competitors from Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray squeezing sign, instead of a son.
“I think that means the messages are not delivered,” he said.
Stealers stole $26,750 when they filled a ATM at Newport on the Key
Stealers on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who added a ATM at Newport on the Key, according to a press release from the Newport police station.
The driver of the car celebrated the ATM in the amusement complex and was preparing to supplement it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While busy, another man "runs away from behind Brink's employee" and steals a bag of money that was meant for delivery.
The witnesses noted more suspects as fleeing the scene of the crime, according to the statement, but the police did not give a specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Jay
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to She.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "Creation formerly known as Kanye West".
The forty-one-year-old West wore the cover for a while and used the cover for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change took place just before his arrival on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who had to give up for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator said.
Although he uses it as a abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously said that the word has religious significance for him.
“I think ‘you’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“What it means is you, it’s us, it’s us.
He departs from Cana, which means the only one, to Him alone, the reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more about who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs is known as Paw Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has published his preference for the names of "Love and Brother Love."
A former West co-worker, Jay-Z, also uses his name with or without a dash and all the letters.
Mexico's AMLO says it will not use the military against civilians
Mexico’s vice president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed that he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to repress the Mexican people."
The army shot peaceful protesters on the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly assistance to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. Needs to Double Funding for Artificial Intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double its research funding in the field, said AI investor and practitioner Kai-fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. does not have a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"The adoption of the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the U.S., and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Deploying the funds could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of AI will be made by the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC on Sunday.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (Superpowers in Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order) was published a month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chief executive officer of Synovation Ventures, which is one of the most-invested of the company.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the top-ranked American intel player, and later became a director at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee was grateful for previous U.S. government technology competitions as a challenge in the agency’s robotics for advanced defense research projects and asked when the next match would be, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often need to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that green cards should be offered automatically to doctors of science in artificial intelligence,” he said.
China’s state council issued its Plan for the Development of the Future Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The China State Foundation for Natural Sciences funds people in academic institutions similar to the way the Natural Sciences Foundation and other government organizations spend money on researchers from the United States, but the quality of work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which should include industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Authorized Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
As far as NSF is concerned, they are currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requiring the creation of a National Commission for the Safety of Artificial Intelligence has been out of action for months.
Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its requests for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a law on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia’s Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question of the referendum charter was: “You are about to join NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece.”
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Gjorgeivska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough MPs said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the exit stood at 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their votes.
“I came out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjo<0xC5><0xA1>e Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko gave their voice to the referendum in Macedonia to change the name of the country, which will open the way for the country to enter NATO and the European Union, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small stage and chairs in front of tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get in with heads raised high, not from the back entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the majority will be for because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said the “yes” result would be “confirmation for our future.”
The poll, which was published last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Political Research, showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required exit.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian TV Telema, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent will vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since they came to power in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes all of Brighton's defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly overcame Brighton's defense in a 2–0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield submission at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly passed between Brighton's three defensive players, before entering the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four "greens".
He circled around a defensive player before competing several others on the edge of Brighton's sixteenth.
He then turned left of him, to Sterling.
The English striker used his first come to sixteen to return the ball to Aguero, who with his right leg beat Brighton's goalkeeper, Matthew Ryan, with a single blow to the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his legs,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored at that point.”
But the initial advantage of the "Heavenly Blues" was given by Sterling in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Liroy Shane.
Shane touched her a few times before taking Sterling to distant status.
The attack of the “heavenly blues” brought the ball into the net before it went out.
City will compete against Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match at 12.55pm on Tuesday in the Rhine-Neckar Arena, Germany.
Chercer wants to play a spoiler against Roxis
Because Nessnells were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But ever-competitive Chercer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Rockis, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockis team, who lead a match against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western League.
Rokis' team had at least a "joker" for a place with a 5–2 win over Nessnells on Friday night, but they are still struggling to establish their place in the first division.
“Even if we don’t play for anything, we can at least throw away knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to be played at the highest level of any moment I’m going to face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in that?”
Nessnells still needs to announce a starter for a week, but is reportedly inclined to allow Shercer to throw in such a situation.
Chercer, who will start on the 34th time, was training throwing on Thursday and would throw usually off on Sunday.
Washington’s right is 18–7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings of the season.
Trump's Mistakes in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation around his election to Brett Cavano for the Supreme Court while talking about the importance of the Republicans' exit from the early elections.
“Everything we’ve done so far will be put at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
“This is one of the big, big ones – I’m not running, but I’m really fighting, so I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You look at these horrible, horrible groups of Democrats, you look at what’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the means at their disposal, you see the evil, the ruthlessness.
“It doesn’t matter who they hurt, when they have to overcome in order to get power and control, that’s what they want power and control, but we’re not going to give them.”
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to “resist and prevent.”
“And you’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, mean, ugly and untrue.”
He mentioned Senator Diana Feinstein of the Democratic Orders, set by the Senate Judiciary Committee, on behalf of which the audience responded with shouts of outrage.
Do you remember her answer?
Have you published the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, wait a little – it was a very bad body speech – the worst body speech I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer accepting different opinions.
They don’t tolerate people who express their opinions.
When the activists of Momentum in my local party voted against me, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last in the line of MPs from the Labour Party who have been told that we are not welcome – just because they express their opinion.
My colleague-parliamentary Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she took a firm stance against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement was criticizing me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
For the importance of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues for which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of the Eastern Labour Party of Nottingham stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a member of the Labour Party parliament, Friday night’s council meetings were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, today, it is not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a “softer, gentle” policy has long been forgotten, if indeed, ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged whether it is acceptable to the party’s leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when the colleagues with whom I thought we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect me to completely change my thinking and to take positions that would otherwise never have taken them for granted.
Whenever I speak in public, and it really doesn’t matter what I say, there is a critical social media harassment that calls for condemnation, a rejection of the policies of the center, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
I’m not the only one with that experience.
In fact, I know that I have more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist abuses every day, but never withdraw.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how the levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every demand for “lack of confidence” or a change in the rules of selection, the party becomes more and more opinion-driven.
I’ve gotten a lot of advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud and then “everything will be okay.”
But that’s not why I came to politics.
Even 32 years ago, when I joined the Labour Party as a student, provoked by the concern of the Thacher government that literally let my classroom collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those who need them most, whether as a local adviser or a mini-government.
I’ve never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the demand on Friday, all I want to say to them is that when the country goes up against Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I don’t understand the desire to spend the time and energy of my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But I have a message that's not about Notingam Momentum, but about my constituents, whether they're members of the Labour Party or not: I'm proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how damning threats or political opportunism I'm going to survive, there's nothing wrong with me.

Ear 38 – 17 Melrose: The Undefeated Ear Goes to the Top
The two late points may have changed the final result somewhere, but there’s no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderfully entertaining match of the day at the Scottish Rugby Championship.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, it’s all due to their superior defense, as well as their better-used chances, which the home team brought, and coach Peter Murchi has the right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested through our games so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Congratulations to Ear, they took better advantage of their chances than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute point, converted by Fraser Klimo, gave Ear an advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given for the game of the Warriors, allowed Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Bagot to grab the unbeaten tie.
Klimo extended Ear's lead with a penalty, previously, exactly at halftime, he scored a point, so he converted a solo point to reach 17–5 for Ear at the rescue.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Andresson's point, converted by Bagot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, which was carried out on a stretcher, and from the start, Ear continued to wrestle with the Staford McDowell point, converted by Klimo.
Ear's CEO, Blair McFarson, then received a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for the extra man with Bruce Colvin's unconverted point at the end of time with ruthless pressure.
But the home team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to knock out Klima without the ball, McFarson played a tachduan from the penalty line on the back of Ear's sharp attack.
Klimo converted, as he did almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe took the blow to David Armstrong and sent winger Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
“Still Game” star looks ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star, Ford Kiran, seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 65-year-old actor is played by Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, on which he is a screenwriter and co-stars with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphile.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be their last, and it looks like Kirnan is planning a life after Crégleng.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source said Kirnan was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade."
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia surrounded by land hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling a covert-lipped naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings have set up a blue sea flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon were carved with the motto: “The sea is ours right.
It is our duty to return.”
Across mainland Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost in favor of Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still fresh, as is the longing to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes are perhaps now the greatest in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of debate.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course it expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calsada, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the international court on the big screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will judge in favor of Bolivia's lawsuit, which, after decades of changeable talks, Chile is bound to negotiate a ceasefire.
Here's Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president of indigenous origin, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, also relies heavily on Monday's ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not judge in favor of Bolivia and that it will not change much even to judge in their favor.
The U.N. body based in the Netherlands will not be able to assign territory to Chile and said it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The international court’s ruling comes just six months after the final arguments indicate that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, an expert on international law from Chile.
And maybe the last four years have brought back the cause of Bolivia instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales's military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calladia also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the problem of the sea as political support.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament if it can’t trust the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can’t trust Washington.
Rie spoke on Saturday in front of the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises given during the Singapore summit between rival leaders. . . .
His comments came at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Rye said it was "fictional" to think that the continued U.S. sanctions and objections to the declarative end of the Korean war would bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the Pyongyang-free declaration first to take significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Trump's second summit.
Paris fashion magazines reveal the latest line of massive hats that is on the way to the biggest stores near you
If you want to improve the size of your hat collection or completely block the sun, then don’t look any further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have unveiled a series of oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the track that blinded the style set at Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely impractical hats launched Instagram this summer and these designers sent their creations that fall into the eye of the runway.
The piece highlighted by Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide rim in the form of feathers that flooded the head of the model.
Other oversized supplements included zircons, magic hats, and even pineapple, but they aren’t designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lector more than high fashion.
One creation resembled scuba diving equipment entirely with glasses and scuba pipe, and the other looked like a slender cornet ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you’re in luck.
Followers of the style predict that huge hats can come to the stores near you.
The oversized hats came very quickly after "La Bomba", the straw hat with a wide two-leaf rim that all carry from Rian to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult fashion house that stands behind the overly impractical hat that spread through social media sent another big creation down the runway, a straw-sized beach bag almost equal in size to the height of the model it was pulling.
The dark orange raffle bag, with a raffle border and a white leather handle, was the piece featured in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus on Fashion Week in Paris.
The stylist of the famous, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer, because the designer caused such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for the big ones.”
John Edward: Language Skills are Necessary for Global Citizens <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which only intensified with individual and group success in sport, art, music and other aspects of the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement customized school programs, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired as an elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it will make him imaginative.
If you speak with him in his tongue, it will strike him in the soul.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent test results, we can note that languages outperform all other subjects with the highest percentage of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved a higher rating of “5+”.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade of “5+” in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who taught German, 69 percent of those who taught French and 63 percent of those who taught Spanish as well.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages now, as an elective subject, are viewed at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the programs of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the OK’s Employment and Skills Commission noted that for the reasons employers cited for failing to fill jobs, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more demanding in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs looking for languages, these skills are needed in the globalized world.
No matter what career someone will choose, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such lifelong skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give preference to polyglot before the competition.
According to the YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language that spoke more than ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
Therefore, investing in language learning is now important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on the classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in OK when viewed in the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child’s interests are, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed for success, no matter what the future may bring.
At the moment, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in schools.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, variety and excellence to young people in Scotland.
"Il faut ben le faire" (it must be done).
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will lead the Lakers to debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait was almost over for fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the first game of the preseason on Sunday against Denver Nagates in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play is still not decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudel, tweeted that James was likely to play for a limited time.
After training at the beginning of the week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule ahead of the Lakers season.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
You Tube channel for Trump's rally in West Virginia.
President Donald Trump began a series of rallies as part of the campaign, tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s five scheduled rallies next week, including visits to places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his election to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court is at a standstill, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, because Republicans may lose control in Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump’s evening rally in West Virginia and how do you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Coast Time Zone tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online with a live stream on YouTube.
This week it is likely that Trump will appeal to the hearing of the man who nominated him for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected delay of voting in the Senate until one afternoon.
The primary goal of the series of rallies is to help Republicans get a boost for the November elections.
Hence, from President Trump’s campaign, they said that these five rallies next week are aimed at “inciting volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect them and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives.”
"Congress control is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible with the start of the tough campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who declined to be named.
Set in the Wesbank Arena in Willing, the evening rally could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media outlets from Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro news.
Saturday was Trump’s second visit to West Virginia last month, a country in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who is behind the polls.
“It’s not good for Morrissey that the president needs to come in to improve the popularity of the polls,” Simon Hyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Cup Rider 2018: The U.S. team has shown courage in the fight to keep the hopes of starting individual competitions alive on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the four on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The transversal of happiness is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
Who would you say happiness is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so we're lucky I guess," Jordan Spitt said at the end of the game.
The Europeans have the advantage, of course, of a four-point lead and twelve more games.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel that they have a weak wind in their veins although they have enough momentum, if nothing else then the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Sleep was great and lead by example.
These strong cheers for the celebration grew stronger during his game, with a key blow that led to a four-to-four draw when he and Thomas had two misses after two rounds.
His strike that won the match at 15 was met with a similar appeal, so he tells you that he believes the American team is not out of the game.
“You just have to dig deep and take care of your game,” Spitt said.
That’s all that’s left for every player right now.
18 holes to reach a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, but wonderful duo of Europe are four out of four and can’t go wrong.
"Mollywood" was the only pair without a bad hit on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad hits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy group ensures that they are the players who will win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players who will provide a potential European victory when the sun comes behind Le Golf Nationale.
Both are preferred at the same time on different holes.
However, the talk of European fame remains unwarranted.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly coped with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the doubles, when he teamed up with Alex Norren.
A missed blow and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spanish and the Swedes in a hole they never managed to get out of.
On Sunday, though, there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
The doubles and fours are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between the partners, the tips they give, the tips they don’t obey, and the way the strategy can be changed at once.
The Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved a significant lead on the last day, but the season of four also showed that the U.S. team can fight even though some, especially Americans, doubted themselves.
Europeans led 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's doubles and four-tenths ahead of the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead of Le Golf National by four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who struggled to retain the trophy he lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the U.S. team that had many misses in the morning doubles and won the series 3-1.
The Americans provided more resistance in the fours, winning two games, but could not reach the lead.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points from 12 individual matches a week to hold the trophy.
Flitwood was the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, named "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, were the second pair to win four points in the first four games in the history of the Cup Rider.
After "smashing" Woods and Patrick Reed into doubles, they played well and defeated the spoiled Woods and American rookie Brayson Deshambo with an even more expressive 5&4 result.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, sometimes played great, but now lost 19 of 29 games in doubles and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, resting as morning doubles lasted, returned as Henry Stanson's partner in Dustin Johnson's 2&1 defeat fours and Brooks Coepka - ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans were not pleased with this pleasant, windy day south-west of Paris.
Three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a two-pointer for the Americans on Saturday.
They achieved a decisive 2&1 win over the Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Pulter in the doubles and returned later to beat Pulter and Rory McClroy by 4&3 in fours, but lost to the starting two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a certain team has recovered from a four-point deficit in an individual game, although as holders of the title, the team's Fourik had a sufficient equal result to retain the trophy.
After a second two days, however, the Sunday counterattack seems to be staying over them.
North Korea says it has “no chance” to disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are deepening distrust in the United States and that there is no chance for the country to unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual World Body General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as shutting down nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities, and reversing nuclear warheads.
“However, we do not see a proper response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
Although he repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to access to nuclear disarmament "in the phase", according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not break down.
Rye alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit of the current U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", the Korean Peninsula.
North Korea called for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States argued that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to step down in strict international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘nuclear disarmament first of all’ and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes ‘the declaration of the end of the war,’” he said.
“The perception that sanctions may not get on your knees is a delusional dream of people who don’t know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions are deepening our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the other side in this nuclear disarmament issue was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of weapons has been so bad.
Despite this, the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different from last year’s, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles to the U.S. mainland is inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump alone “supposedly.”
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "complete the destruction" of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain up to scratch.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeline for it, saying "It takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the Security Council’s sanctions must continue fully and without exception until a complete, definitive nuclear disarmament is confirmed.”
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in order to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time he did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea just hours later because of “gangster demands.”
North Korea has committed to a meeting with Moon this month over the disarmament of a missile facility, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he was asking for are the security guarantees Trump gave in Singapore, as well as moves to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend courses to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates on more sleep in order to combat the growing maco-culture of learning by staying up all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often don’t know anything when it comes to basic self-care.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designed the course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to begin the course after holding a talk about the impact of insufficient sleep on learning.
“At the end of the lecture a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?’
She said that no one, never told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help in academic and athletic performance, and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students have a serious lack of sleep over the course of the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a student home where students press on cups of coffee, curtains, slippers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how insufficient sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of routine when going to bed.
In another part, participants learn about how a long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their day-to-day routine.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke,” Professor Chaizler added.
The culture of pride with “work all night” still exists, he said, and in addition, modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Having enough sleep, with good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid obesity, because the lack of sleepiness causes the brain to overwhelm.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaizler design the course after attending one of his classes last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course throughout the student city.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chaizler advises students to think about setting an alarm about when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted from the electronic screens and LED light, which is causing the problem, which is causing it to glow.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal is to lure Gerard's people
The Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's strike sent Stephen Gerard's disarming team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Aibrox team wanted to register their first win after the February 4–1 victory at St. John's, but Gary Holt's team made Gerard's second defeat in 18 games as a manager who left his team with eight points behind in the race.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time, and Rangers' set lost his inspiration and chances of leveling out.
Now the Rangers fell to sixth place, and Livingston climbed to third and were only behind Hibernian by the difference in goals.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers after line judge Kalum Spence had to receive medical attention due to a head injury after he was apparently hit by an object from a distance.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that passed Aer in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 Livingstons who won a point with the Harts last week and would be delighted at the way his well-trained stance pushed opponents at every chance.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than with them.
They needed to score a point, two minutes after Menga's first loss kicked Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the middle-class player missed the chance.
Then a strike from a distance from Kihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgow could only play openly in the defense.
The Rangers managed to control the game, but it seemed there was more hope than belief in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should get a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he and Steven Lowles collided, but Judge Steven Thomson did not give a sign of approval of the Colombian's complaint.
The Rangers managed to score only two shots to the goal in the first half, but the former Eibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not back down from the head-to-head hit of Lasana Kulibali and the weak hit of Ovi Edaria.
Although the start of Livingston's 34th minute may have been the opposite of the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved their game.
Once again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs's blow.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who with a cold head chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerard reacted during the half-time when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the winger passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his line with a blockade.
But Livingston managed to attract guest players to play the type of game they enjoy, with Litgoo and Hackett catching many of the long additions.
Holt's team was able to extend the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor set himself up well and prevented Jacobs from playing with his head around the corner.
Reingers' replacement, Glen Middleton had yet another request for a penalty after he collided with Jacobs, but Thomson did not approve again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now one side of our almanac "On a Sunday in the Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE DECIDE ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of a device known as a Geiger counter.
Since then, it has become the main stronghold of science, the Gayger counter has become the main stronghold of popular culture, as in the 1950 film The Colorado Bell, in which the seemingly incredulous, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans perform:
Man: "What's that again?"
Rogers: “It’s a geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
“When you put the headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms that emit the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Say, it must be jumping now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
The new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” foreign cells.
The new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” foreign cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their alterations in the laboratory
You can “see” protein in many types of cancer, and then be returned to the body
The trial vaccine gives promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells, ovarian cancer disappeared in 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory, so that they can "see" a protein's frequency in many types of cancer called HER2, and then returning them to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofski, of the American National Institute for Cancer at Betez, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot.”
HER2 “encourages the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and their “learning” how to target cancer cells works in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump comeback, wearing a hat with his motto, after a performance on Saturday night live.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during a live show on Saturday night, after a useless performance in which U.S. President Donald Trump missed and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called City of Ghosts, in which he wore a cap with the inscription "Make America Famous Again", he began to criticize the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white man, they say, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago,” he said.
The Saturday, evening live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Cavano's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, linked to allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of the West's downfall was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time going behind the scenes because of his cap.
“They made fun of me behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't show up with that hat."
They made fun of me!
Then they told me that I was in a submerged place, he said, according to Washington Examiner.
News continued: “Do you want to see the submerged place?” he said that he would “put his Superman cap on, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try it with love.”
His comments attracted outrage from the audience at least twice, and the team at the evening show seemed embarrassed, reports Varajeti, a man said to the publisher: “The whole studio takes over.”
The news was brought as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend rapper McMiller died a few days ago.
News surprised many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as Perrier's bottle.
News received support from the leader of the TPSAD conservative group, Kendis Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits: YOU’VE BECOME WHAT YOU’RE PROVIDED TO TOLPATA.”
But show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "was her own and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) for whom I believe he accepts and expands an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“We too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, while he is now "formally known as Kane West".
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff Daddy, and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg has the name Snoop Lyon and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Prosecution for attempted murder at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balikhakmore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear before the High Court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Star of the series Game of Thrones, Keith Harington, attacked the toxic masculinity
Keith Harington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman as John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantastic series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the macho-hero stereotype, when he stated that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement on the culture section of the Sanday Times, Keith said he believed "something is wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #SegaKazawam.
Keith, who recently married the star of the Game of Thrones, Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted to having “strong feelings” about the issue.
“I personally have strong feelings, at the moment – where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What do you learn from TV, and what on the street, what makes young boys feel that they have to have a certain side of masculinity?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
Because it's obvious that something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not take part in the continuation of the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he "ends with battles and horses".
From November, Keith will perform in Sam Shepard's True West revival, which is a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he thinks that getting to know his wife Rose is the best thing that came out of the Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so in a way she gave me my future family and my life in the future,” he said.
Rose played Igrit, a character who had a love interest with Keith's character, John Snow, in the fantastic series that won the Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly across some parts of China as a result of transfusions with infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grew by 100,000 people.
Transmitting HIV through sex is an urgent issue of the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people by the LGBT community is high.
Because of the country’s conservative values, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inappropriate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied data from a member of the Republican Party's staff as "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican senators in the U.S. on the pages of Wikipedia's lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat believed the claims were made by "ultra-right" sympathizers and web sites.
"Lies, lies, and more after disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes the home address and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hetch of Utah.
The information appeared on the internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill as the Senate panel of hearings over allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Cavano, who was nominated as a judge of the Supreme Court.
The leaked information appeared shortly after Kavanaugh was interrogated by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandits and Redsteet have announced that the IP address identifying the source of the announcement is linked to Waters' office and information about a member of Waters' staff has been released, Hill said.
“These unfortunate accusations are completely false and represent an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of those false and false accusations – is in no way responsible for the information provided.
Unfortunate accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie.”
Waters’s statement quickly drew criticism on the Internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Flasher.
"These denials are nervous," wrote Flaischer.
“This shows that she has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He can't be challenged.
He should not be questioned about the motives of the accused.
He has to stay calm and calm.”
Fletcher seems to have compared Waters' reaction to criticism of the Democrats associated with Judge Cavano, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navaro, a Republican candidate who is running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also announced on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s a big deal,” he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had reported “the relevant institutions and the police about the false allegations.
“We will allow the perpetrators to be exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff.”
Opinion of Johnny English Attacks Again - undermines the spy scams of Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for elements of Brexit in every new British-connected film, and that seems to apply to this renewal of the franchise of the fraudulent, action comedy Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was repeated in 2011.
Will the careful self-talk on the issue of how obvious we are to nowhere be the new export opportunity that the nation has?
Despite this, the face with big eyes and a lot of makeup on the incompetent Johnny English got a license to "stop" things a second time - his name above all means that he is a comic creation with a wide scope, made for viewers in cinemas in places where he is not.
He is, of course, a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for careful glamour after a bit like Cluzo, has drawings of Mr. Bin and part of the boy playing a note from the song Kochii on fire from the 2012 Opening Ceremony at Olpyim.
His base is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once appeared in Barcles' now-forgotten TV commercial, leaving chaos behind him.
There's one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I liked it a lot when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's passion for physical comedy can be seen, but the humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since "serious" film brands like 007 and Impossible Mission and themselves contain elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be meant for children, rather than adults, and for me Johnny Inglesh's freaking mishaps aren't as inventive and focused as the unashamed stares of Atkinson's character.
The issue that has been going on all along is that the UK is in serious trouble.
Cyber-hacker infiltrated Britain's super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of the agent who is on duty - a disappointingly small role for Kevin Eldon.
In the final chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and combative figure and already suffers from a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thomson gives herself in this character of Quasi-Tereza-May, but there is nothing special in the scenario with which it would work.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired ones.
And that means calling himself Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in a private school, but "in black" gives classes for secret agents: there are a few good guys here, when English offers a spy school that looks like a rock academy.
English is quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former co-worker Bow, who plays Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, in relation to a submarine commander, a comic role in which Vicky Pepperdin is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, to get rid of everything in the Royal Secret Service, return to action and meet the fatally beautiful Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Walta, played by Jake Lacey.
The English and Bow begin their odyssey of absurd proceedings: rendered as waiters they set fire to a French restaurant; they make a void after wandering themselves on the luxury yacht of the Volta; and the English initiates a right-wing anarchy when he tries to use it.
All the brakes are removed for the last sequence, but as nice and noisy as it is, there is plenty of children's TV throughout the film.
Nice, moderate things.
And like the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry play the role of Rowan Atkinson, who will use his talent?
Labour denies plans to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan that the British will work four days a week - but will be paid for five.
The party is said to want the bosses of companies to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give the workers another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but would take the same salary.
According to sources, the idea “fits” the party’s economic agenda and plans for the country to be subordinated to the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week is backed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior member of the party told the Sunday Times: “The revision of the strategy should be published before the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an effort that is in line with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party advocated for a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, the aspiration was not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not a party strategy and the party is not considering such an idea.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of “personless directors” and “profiters” in municipal firms.
The Chancellor’s plans in the shadow also mean that current shareholders in the water supply companies may not get the full share back because the Labour government could make “deductions” for unethical behavior.
He also confirmed plans for employees to become part of the company’s boards and to create Inclusive Property Funds, which will make up 10 percent of the private company’s capital to employees, who will be able to take an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are making a 60-Minute statement about whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mind.
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavano delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and updated the question of whether the findings of the bureau could be reconsidered by some Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview published on Sunday, Scott Peley, the 60 Minutes correspondent, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I think it is,” Kennedy said.
“I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was strong, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice, however, looks like it's carved into a stone.
“My decision has been made for Brett Cavano and a shocking accusation is needed,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett was vigorously denying it,” Graham added, thinking of Christine Blaise Ford.
“All the names she gave me couldn’t be confirmed.
That's 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen’s Festival and did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring famous stars and has an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizen Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will come to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy performances of names such as Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Sean Mendes, but also to all of you to the end.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the project against global poverty, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free event ticket (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must perform several tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call or some other useful work that will do us all the time.
But how successful is a Global Citizen because there are 12 years left to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to ask to take something or just another case of “click-activism” – people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million "activities" by supporters, which have worked for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped encourage world leaders to highlight commitment and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 promises and announcements that are the result of their activities, of which $10 billion have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the Food Power, a partnership of investors and implementers, based in the UK, dedicated to "helping children harness their potential", which promises to provide $35 million for Rwandans for aid around the 4th acre of land.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens alike, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a landmark in history,” Ambassador Tracy Ulman of the Food Powers, told the gathering in 2018 at the concert.
The group also said more than 5,000 activities were undertaken related to calls to improve the diet of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the project, the Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website “Why do you think you can put an end to extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen said: “It will be a long and arduous journey – we will never succeed.
But like the big civic and anti-apartheid movements in front of us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will perform at this year's New York event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the navy for “blockage” in order to prevent Russian energy exports - Ministry of Interior
Washington could “if necessary” use the navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinky said in a statement.
According to Zinki, Russia's involvement in Syria - namely, where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government - has been stopped to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of the energy market, as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And according to the government representative, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that the sea lanes will remain open and, if necessary, block their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki spoke to attendees at an event organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group representing itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that it is effectively the same.
"Iran and Russia's economic option is, more or less, to raise investment and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as "an uncomfortable pony" with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
The statement followed after the Trump administration began a mission to boost the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step down from the "inappropriate" North Tech 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made from Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11-billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline should double the current gas pipeline’s capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, it’s just an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s firm opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that customers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position came under pressure from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the German Industries Federation (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kemf, the first man of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “carefully consider” whether to run for president in 2020, said Senator from Massachusetts.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "carefully consider" whether to run for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holiok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running for office.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our non-functional government, and that means a woman on the forehead,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will carefully consider whether to run for president.”
Warren praised President Donald Trump's work during a meeting at the city assembly and said he "led the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m too worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is open to criticism of Trump and the man he nominates as a judge in the Supreme Court, Brett Cavano.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her constituency think that she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said the senator should not run, according to a study by the University of Safolk/Boston Globe's Center for Political Research.
Thirty-two percent support such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential nomination, and 48 percent opposing it.
Other well-known names from the Democratic Party being discussed for nomination in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin talks about the post-traumatic syndrome of Trek Paylin at a Donald Trump rally
Track Paylin, 26, has spent a year in Iraq since signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday evening.
“From what my son is going through, through what he's going through after they're back, I know how other families feel that are torn apart because of the post-traumatic syndrome and the wounds that our soldiers are returning with,” she told a rally audience for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peilin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other military veterans "they come back a little different, they come back fortified, they come back and ask if there is any respect for what they and their comrades have been doing."
He was arrested on Monday in Vassila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence with assaulting a woman, along with a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Den Bennett, a police spokesman in Vassila.
18 states and the city of Washington support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the city of Washington support the challenge of a new U.S. policy that prevents the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 states and the city of Washington filed a petition with the amicus curiae court on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker challenging the policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Parliament case, which the U.S. Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the violent members of his gang" abused her, but the US authorities rejected her request for asylum on July 20.
She was locked up in Texas.
The state defense attorney representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of U.S. asylum claims originate, as nations with persistent gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repeals a 2014 decision by the Immigration Complaints Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington City Attorney General Carl Rasin said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of lawmaking at the federal and international level, federal and international levels."
“Federal law requires all asylum requests to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such provision violates that principle,” according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, advocates in the letter argue that policies that prevent immigrants from entering are harmful to the U.S. economy because they are likely to become entrepreneurs “to offer the necessary labor force.”
Public defender Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“There is asylum for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 political presentation.
Asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are being made in Palu because the number of victims has doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
“It’s very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she weighed her male baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There is no clean water.”
Residents return to their ruined homes and choose from their listed items to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has fractures to his back and shoulder, rested in front of Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside, due to frequent successive minor earthquakes.
Tears came to his eyes as he described the severe earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the wall's urn, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife asking for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the child.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Maltreating’ With ‘Promotional Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in the U.S. daily listing the mutual benefit of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke of the paid addition of Teana Daily to the De Moine Register - the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, China rejected the accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked the downfall of U.S. services to Reuters, a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements for promotion of trade, Beijing and Washington, they are currently in a trade war in which they balance import tariffs with each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at exporters from allied countries such as Iowa, which backed Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing was hurting U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the weekly edition of the De Moin Register, “now doubles the abuse of propaganda in our free press.”
“In the course of the spread of propaganda, the Chinese government is abusing the nurtured American tradition of free speech and free media by placing advertisements on the De Moin Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Contrary to that, in the nearby newspaper stand here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you won’t see a real reflection of the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s problematic economic trajectory, because the media outlets are tightly controlled by the Communist Party.
He added that "one of the most widely read newspapers in China rejected his offer to publish" on the column, although he did not say which newspaper it is about.
Republicans are moving away from women's voices ahead of mid-term elections due to the debacle with Cavano, analysts warn
Because many Republicans do not observe or defend Brett Cavano's nomination to the Supreme Court despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already stated that they want to continue with the vote.
There's no turning back from such things," Grant Richer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell College of Syracuse University, wrote in a column published on Saturday.
Richer said he had doubts that pressure from the FBI to investigate Senator Jeff Flake (Republican of Arizona) would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" in a protest in the Senate hallway, when Republicans, who have control of the Legal Affairs Committee, decided to continue with the nomination of Kavanaugh and despite the testimony of Dr. Brady.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst for the news site.
“People say they’re tall; that’s right.
But they may be higher, especially among independent female voters in the suburbs and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which detailed her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court judge’s candidate, analysts suggest that it could have negative consequences if Republicans continue to vote.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Style, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to news reports from NBC.
“It’s not just about voting in the committee or the last vote or whether Cavano will go to a hearing, it’s also about how Republicans handled this and how they treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps in the election.
However, Americans are divided around who to trust after Ford and Cavano's testimony, although a larger number accept the first-remembered side.
A new survey by Yu-Gov shows that 41 percent of respondents either definitely or likely believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or likely believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in the testimony, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other, to Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, under oath, last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez accuses the Supreme Court judge's candidate of showing her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup business that claims to be a rival to Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrapt, is a company built on the solid open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Companies, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s intent was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the start-up business.
“Now is the moment of history.”
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own "Internet Data Warehouse" or abbreviated POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal data warehouse on the Internet is that it only depends on the user who has access to certain types of information.
The company calls it “personal data-enhancing.”
Inrapt’s idea, according to CEO John Bruce, is the company to provide resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several development developers with a contract to work on the project, and a community of coders-volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrapt’s web site.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely turned upside down overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a press release on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrapt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the basis of Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the Consortium of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's World Wide Web.
Recently, Berners-Lee has been an influential speaker in the debate on net neutrality.
Even at the start of Inrapt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the Consortium of the World Network, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m a big optimist for the new era on the Internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Famous bearer of the Victorian cross from the First World War
The only priest of the Church of England who received the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter, has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, Honorable Bernard Van received recognition on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Belenglis and Lehaucur.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never found out that he had received the highest British military distinction.
A commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandsons at a parade in Rashden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was an “incredible symbol” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the honour.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "from a very thick fog and under a strong fire of cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to the places from which he shot himself and with "the greatest courage" he led forward, before attacking the Toboggan's nest himself and disabling three of the servants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s works were “something I know I will never be able to do, but it’s something that doesn’t make me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Van also placed a wreath after the parade led by the Young Imperial Band of Brentwood.
Michael Van said he was "very honored to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given by many people."
Fans of the combined fighting skills stayed up all night to watch Belator 206, instead they got Pepa Pig
Imagine, you’re up all night to watch the Bellator 206, and you don’t have the opportunity to watch the main event.
The San Jose list contained 13 fights, including six with the main card being shown live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gerard Musassi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were stunned when the channel moved to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after staying awake until the early hours of the fight.
One of the Twitter fans described the move to a children’s cartoon as “some painful joke.”
“The law is such that at 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate, so it had to be transferred to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"The pig's ass, yes"
The company's president, Belator Scott Cooker, said it would work on a schedule that would include viewers from Britain in the future.
"I think when I think about re-release, I think we can probably find a solution," Cooker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to find a solution on Sunday after our time, and on Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, we got a lot of messages in the transfer, and none of them were benevolent.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a legal issue.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of five fights, instead of six - as we usually do - we tried to deliver more because of the fans and we overreacted.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Albums on a deserted island: Tom Daley felt “inferior” because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “everyone is not like me”
Speaking on Radio 4's first show Disks on an empty island, presented by Laurent Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent caused him to worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show Kirsty Young, took several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a supporting character on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than anyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathies with boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, those feelings of inferiority and diversity were the things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove he was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally find out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medallist became a well-known supporter of LGBT campaigns and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live openly without division and wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said of falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar-winning actor, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at an early age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar heights and depths.
The two became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said "all his views" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t say to him, ‘You’re not going to be here to be in the first place,’” he said.
“I held my hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized he was invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew that this is what I’ve been dreaming about all my life – jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Pride by Heather Small - which turned into his head in preparation for the Olympics and from which he was still clinging.
Disks on the empty island of BBC Radio 4 is on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Michaelson, a horse not in shape, was at the club during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play in the 47th edition of the Cup Ryder, but will have to change shape to avoid an unfortunate turnaround.
Michaelson, who played at the biennial event for the 12th time, was sent to the club by Captain Jim Furick during Saturday's doubles and fours.
Instead of being at the center of attention, as often represented by the United States, the five-time winner, he took the time to bend and practice his game, the scope, in the hope that he would correct what he was whispering.
He has never been the best leader, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close-knit Le Golf National, where far-flung hits are a regular punishment in case of negligence.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Michaelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces the precise champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who plays in pairs with rookie Tommy Flitwood to win in all four matches of the same season.
If the Americans, who are missing four points before 12 individual games, start hard, Michaelson’s game can be crucial.
Furick expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see another.
“He fully understood the role he had today, he touched my back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” he said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He’s been a part of the fame and has given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t know how to play two games.
I thought more, but it went that way, and we thought we had to do that.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Copa Ryder games on Sunday.
It could be the end of his career at the Ryder Cup where he has never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Michaelson has 18 wins, 20 lost games and seven halves, although Furik said his presence carries something intangible to the team.
He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s sensitive, he likes to joke about people, and he’s a great guy at team meetings.”
“I think the younger players were having fun playing with him, as they did this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers so much more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn knows that great leadership may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, from experience knows that a significant lead before individual competitions on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an awkward position.
Danez made his debut at the Valderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Balesteros had a five-point lead in front of the Americans, but "crossed the finish line only with the bears", with a minimum lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I remind myself that we had a big lead in Valderama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, when we lost in Valderama, when we won for a little bit,” Bjorn said, as he watched the 2018 class win with 5-3 on Friday.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Get ready for tomorrow.
Go out and play as you should.
This isn’t over until the game is over.
We have a goal, and that’s to try to win the trophy and the focus remains on it.
I say all the time, I focus on 12 players in our team, but we are fully aware of the opposing side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn added: “I don’t want to give too early an assessment on the issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
Tomorrow we are going to play a different game, and that’s different.
It’s great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then all the skills are tested as a golfer.
This is the message that should be sent to the players, to give themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he has to give everything of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furick will ask players to play better individually than they played in pairs, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furik himself was on both ends of the changes on the last day because he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finishing as a loser when Europe performed the "Miracle in Medina"
“I remember every word out there,” he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought the players together before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start as at the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the momentum goes in a certain direction, it carries a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set the line accordingly and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to make magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of opposing first and facing Rory McLroy in the most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flintwood and Ian Polter with the other Europeans in the most important half of the series.
"I decided to play this way with the guys because I think that's how we're going to cover everything," Bjorn said of the individual game selection.
The new German warship has been rescheduled.
The German Navy's latest frigate was supposed to be delivered in 2014 to replace the obsolete warships from the Cold War era, but that won't happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of Rhineland-Palatinate, the leading ship of the new class of frigates Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Di Cite, referring to a spokesman for the army.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problematic issues after the delivery prevented the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acoustic track.
Among other important features is the rare maintenance - it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent up to two years from home ports.
However, constant delays mean that modern warships - which should allow Germany to have power across the oceans - will be out of date as long as they enter service, notes De Zeit.
The unlucky F125 frigate reached the headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blom and Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
Software shortages were especially important because the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also found that the ship is drastically above the planned weight that reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - also became a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) - an increase from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems faced by the latest frigates are particularly important due to the warnings of Germany’s reduced naval force.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the navy "disposed of ships that could be deployed".
The representative said the problem had worsened over time, as the old ships were withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of the Lilies
A new property survey is being carried out in the Scottish Highlands in order to find out how lilacs use the border in their search for food.
There is hope that the findings will provide answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help guide future protection activities.
The study of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow ordinary and soprano-lilies, as well as long-eared coffee liqueurs and daubenton liqueurs at Inverou Gardens in Western Ross.
Special cameras will be placed at key locations around the property to track the activities of the lilacs during the season.
En-Ech-es staff and volunteers will also carry mobile research using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds of all the images will determine the frequency depending on the type of lilies.
Then a map of habitats will be created to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Dever, nature conservation advisor at En-Ty-Es, hopes the results will reveal which areas of life are most important to the lily and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forests for lilys and other related species.
The population of lilacs in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and development that affect the beds and the loss of habitats.
Veterinarians and lights also pose a risk, as well as adhesive tapes for flies and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks on domestic cats.
Lilacs aren't really blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to capturing prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to find insects and obstacles in the path of flight.
En-Tie-es, which takes care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the lilies very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, bed inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organisation even established the first and only reserves for lilacs in Scotland on the Triv estate in Damfris and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
Property manager David Thomson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
“We have an excellent area for lilys here in Triv,” he said.
“We have old buildings, very old two and very good living quarters.
But there are a lot of unknown things about the lilies, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us learn more about what they need to progress.”
He stressed that it is important to check whether there are lilacs before renovating the properties because the unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 women and infants, and destroy the entire local population.
Lilies are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer in the Lilies Protection Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about the lilies and our other species, we just don’t know how they live.”
Ronaldo has denied allegations of rape, and lawyers will sue the German magazine, according to Reuters.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the accusations of raping “fake news,” adding that people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who has announced the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, named Catherine Majorga, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to stop talking about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on Instagram's live video of its 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "fake news."
“No, no, no, no, no.
What was brought out today is fake news," the five-time winner of the gold ball told his camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that’s part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and it's okay," the player added, laughing.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they called an “unacceptable transfer of doubt from private life,” according to Reuters.
Christian Scherz said the player would seek damages for “moral damage in addition to the amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident, which was the subject of the charges, took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed with the court in Clark County, Nevada.
Majorga claimed that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "good boy" but dropped below that "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was consent.
Majorga also claimed that she went to the police and pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an agreement without judicial participation because she feared revenge" and was concerned "until she was publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to change the deal because there are traumas from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juventus with a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain ‘will always regret’ the loss it has made to car manufacturers
Britain will "always regret" if it loses the status of world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clarke said.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota Britain had announced to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at a factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
Japan's carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston - which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be an end to production at our factory,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have expressed concern about how cross-border trade, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover, will function when leaving the EU without a deal.
Be-Em-Wee, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call the risks of the logistics chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates according to the system "exactly on time", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU, for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a break in the border that the industry says could cause delays and shortages in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock of inventory at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU was “exactly made to avoid such border checks.”
“We need to have a deal. We need to have the best deal that will allow us not only the success that we are going to enjoy in the present, but to seize this opportunity,” he told the BBC’s Radio 4 today program.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a representative of the union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once he takes those jobs off, they will never come back.
According to a government spokesman, “We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, the White House said.
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “scheduled for another week” as he continues the fight over Brett Cavano’s nomination for a judge in the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and potential violations of the law by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy public defender and thereby threaten Miller’s independence, prompts talks in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with the release of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he "wouldn't" dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid clashing with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, committed a felony.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a one-week investigation by the FBI in connection with the charges against Kavanaugh, which would further delay the vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting has not yet been determined, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week in view of all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see how things are going and I’m always trying to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists are contesting the claim: Sanders has not held a briefing for reporters at the White House since Sept. 10.
The driver, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings were not due to the "great influence" of television journalists, although he added: "I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
“The president is organizing more questions and answers than any president before him,” she said, adding without giving any evidence: “We looked at those numbers.”
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask directly questions to the president of the United States, that’s far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this more often and you are witnesses that we have been doing it constantly over the past few weeks, and conversations with the President of the United States will replace briefings for journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why it is so with his uncontrolled and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
Health Secretary by letter to EU workers employed in Scotland’s national health system in connection with fears related to Brexit (English)
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers working in Scotland's national health system expressing their gratitude to the country and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, an MP for the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the costs of settled applications for status for EU citizens working in public services at a lower level.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: “The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued during the summer, with a view to making the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up preparations for the possibility of a no-deal deal.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are of value to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, the Tennessee State Tigers' defensive linebacker, was subjected to an emergency operation after suffering a head injury on Saturday when the team lost 31–27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of Teheran said.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before midnight.
“He came to the side line of the playground and just collapsed on the ground,” Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground, and then put him in a stretcher and took him to a further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left an operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/degree of injury" and "Tennessee State" is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecrombie is a second-year student and plays her first season in red dress at Tennessee State after the transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, resulting in a total of 18 tackles made this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK.
According to Tory’s new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The ministry expects this move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year, funds that will be used to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and to focus on high-earning individuals.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and firms that do not pay tax in the UK, with the additional funds will strengthen the government’s efforts to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional amount that, in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of a property with the intention of renting it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects this move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, which has led to price increases and caused difficulties for those who buy property for the first time to get involved in this process of buying a home.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “spirit cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the major construction firms of offering high prices for the properties they keep the land, but did not use it and asked Mrs May to change the quotas for affordable homes in order to correct the "shameful housing situation" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including tent controls and ending evictions without a valid reason.
He also wants the councils to give them greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime minister to returning to the British dream, that is, to make life better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies to be able to buy homes in as easy a way as valuable British residents.
The dream of owning your own home for many people has become too far away, and the humiliation of the homeless is too real.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland”
Jack Ross, head of Sunderland, said his "final ambition" was to become the manager of Scotland's national club in the future.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which is currently third in the first league with only three points less than the club at the top.
This summer, he moved to St. Mirren Stadium after returning them to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up constantly watching Scotland in Hampden with my father and always pulled something back from me.
However, I could only get such an opportunity if I’m successful in managing the club.”
Some of Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gas Poet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said he felt no anxiety knowing that he should follow such established names in such a large club, having previously rejected bids from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“My success at the moment is assessed by ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Given the structure and facilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task for this club to get there, but I’ll probably think I’ve achieved success here only if I get the club back there.”
Ross worked as a manager for only three years, in which he entered the career after working as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and after 15 months as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped "Alloa" secure from falling in the third league and returned "St. Mirren" from the brink of losing the title to the Championship the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
“That was probably a real crusade for me,” he recalls of the takeover of “Alloa.”
“I honestly believed that a career as a manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I went well, I made enough money from it, and I enjoyed certain high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good about the role of manager.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I do, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever in my entire adult life.”

According to a study, the perfect time for a beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the profits of British pubs that are currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA’s business consulting services firm in determining these figures said: “Sunset time and longer than England’s expected participation in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when the profit of the pubs was 2 percent.
The drop in sales of 1.8 percent of restaurants in June was even worse during July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly sold have seen a much greater increase compared to previous years, as opposed to restaurants where there has been a decline.
The pubs where food is mostly sold were also badly affected by the solar periods, although not as dramatic as the owners of restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, the sale of beverages increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and the sale of food by only three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The time and influence of major social and sporting events remains to be the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It’s no surprise that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although the drop in sales of 4.8 percent over a one-year period will be particularly striking in addition to the current pressures that create costs.
The long warm summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for the owners of locations where food is mostly sold, and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide the much-needed respite.”
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the release of new brands.

One in five children has a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents.
One study found that one in five children, some of whom are just 11 years old, have a secret social media profile that hides them from their parents and teachers.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of “false Instagram” profiles.
The news raised the fear that such profiles would be posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a “main” profile that they show to their parents.
One in five children, some of whom are just 11 years old, create a social media profile that hides them from adults.
The study, which included 20,000 high school students, showed a rapid increase in the number of “false Insta” profiles, a shortcut for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news raised the fear that such profiles would be posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a purified “main” profile that they show to their parents, and at the same time have other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found the secret profile of her 13-year-old daughter on the same found a teenager asking others to “rape him.”
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools showed that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 years have two profiles, and half of them admit that one of them is their own.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Elid Doyle will be the “sporter’s voice” on the Scottish Athletics board
Elid Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors at the governing body's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most prestigious athlete, and President Ian Beatty has described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of the leadership in this sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience gained over the past decade.
“Everyone in the Scottish, British and world athletics community has a tremendous respect for Elid and we are confident that the athletes in Scotland would have a huge benefit if she became a member of the board,” Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I am prepared to be the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can really make my contribution and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200- and 400-meter titles at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to the four gold medals he won at the Olympic Games, and who now appears regularly as a commentator on the BBC, was unable to walk after suffering a transient discharge.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I'm going to fix it or to what extent.
The whole process was exhausting, but I managed to fully consolidate, I can go again and do exercises for agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages.”
An advertisement for a breast pump in which mothers are compared to cows caused a split of opinions on the Internet
A construction pump company caused a split in opinions on the Internet when it published an ad in which breastfed mothers were compared to cow sledding.
To mark the launch of the product that is said to be the “world’s most active construction pump”, user-oriented technology company “Elvie” has released a funny ad inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump brings to life.
Four mothers dance in a cow shed full of hay on a song whose lyrics sound like, "Yes, I'm milking, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed these aren't names, these are my breasts."
“Pump up, pump up, feed the babies, pump up, pump up, freeze my chest.”
However, the ad, which was posted on Facebook by the company's website, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it highlights the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“A really bad decision is to use cows to advertise this product.
They, just like us, need to get pregnant and give birth so that they can produce milk, except that their children are stolen from them only a few days after they are born," one of the comments read.
Elvie's construction pump discreetly fits into the lactator ("Elvie"/"Mother")
Another comment reads: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?”
Someone else added: “Really inappropriate advertising.”
Others, however, defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really "funny."
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy a pump like that if I were still here.
Because of the cold, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's a great product," one of the comments said.
Another commented: “This is a fun ad for mothers who freeze milk (often in their workplaces or in toilets) and feel like ‘cows.’
This is not an ad that fails or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were dancing while discreet pumps were being pumped into their gardens.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk-squeezing pumps say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely quiet, no wires, no pipes, and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding nursery, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out of the house while they are milking.
Anna Ballarin, partner and RDR at Mother, commented: “Elvie’s pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between the women who milk and dairy cows we wanted to milk with the help of a pump and the challenges that it brings us to put the same in the center of attention, while also showing the incredible feeling of freedom to the cow.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has been present in all the headlines.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the fashion runway for designer Marta Jakubovski wearing the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of children in detention has increased significantly, although the border crossings at the monthly level have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the fact that the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate children.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and were afraid of endangering their own stay in the country if they asked to be a sponsor of a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to file fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official last week testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not previously have a criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors illegally reside in the country and a large part of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That’s why we continue to hunt down these individuals,” Mr Albens said.
In order for cases with children to be dealt with more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules under which some of them will be required to appear in court within one month of being detained, rather than within 60 days, as the workers in the shelters say had voted in the past.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not in person, in order to bring their case for legal status before the immigration judge.
Those who are deemed to be unfit for relief will be immediately deported.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outages or attempted escapes, say workers in shelters and reports that have emerged from the system in the past few months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where due to its size there is a greater likelihood that signs that the child is facing difficulties will be ignored.
They added that moving children to the tent city, without providing them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends, could increase the trauma most of them are already facing.
Syria has told the US, French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Mualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying in Syria on the pretext that they were involved in the fight against terrorism and that "they will be dealt with accordingly."
“They have to withdraw immediately and do so without setting conditions,” he told the assembly.
Mualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "lead this world battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of the two terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on its territory destroyed by the war.
Regarding the refugee issue, Mualem said the conditions were good for them to return and accused "some of the Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They politicize the question of what should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reconstruction assistance until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia on the province where three million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the deal has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be aimed at jihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front associated with al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated."
U.N. Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon convene the first meetings of the new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition in order to draft a constitution for Syria and open the way to elections.
Mualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "considering members of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in it.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump will win the 2020 election again unless with impeachment and scandal his presidential term is prematurely terminated, which is likely to be expected by a large number of liberals.
In what will undoubtedly be the “Most Dramatic Final in a Presidency Ever Seen!”
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, the hit-time rating has more than doubled and reached 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled and reached 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Nilsen says Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time of the crash, which is 1.7 million more compared to the period four years ago, and MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show reached the top cable rating with around 3.5 million viewers on Saturday night.
"This is like a fire that people feel attracted to because it's not something we understand," said Neil Baer, ABC's chief television producer of the drama "Designated Survivor" for a secretary of the cabinet who becomes president after Capitol was destroyed from the crash.
Neal Skwell, a veteran of comedy writing and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
“He said, ‘Because I think it’s really funny,’” Ms. Skwell told me.
There’s a lot of fun in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, as well as the welfare of the global economy.
Excluding all this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you're no longer an uninformed citizen of Washington when you've been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of the source of "deep background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", Post's "Bomb Jacket from the New" by Paul MacDonald
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario in the same way.
“Part of what he does and what makes you feel like watching a reality show is that every night he brings you something new,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars for the pre-show rotation team.

When I visited Mr. Flies this week it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside and watched "MSNBC" while filming on "CNN".
He could not stop watching, at least not when Brett Cavano was to face the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical condition.
“I remember we were doing all those crazy shows in the past and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Flies told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

The influx of foreign funds in the narrowest mid-term elections in the race for the Upper House
It is not surprising that the 17th congressional district in Pennsylvania is receiving a large amount of funding thanks to the reorganization of the congressional areas from which there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
This newly reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh is run by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who took a place in another area of the emergency election last spring.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th congressional district, and who largely overlaps with the new 17th congressional district.
The maps were changed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old areas were manipulated in favor of Republicans, which is contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congressional district is a tough competition to fund campaigns among the main sponsors of the parties, the Democratic Party's Congressional Campaign Committee ("DCC") and the Republican Party's National Campaign Committee ("NRCC").
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the emergency elections for the 18th Pennsylvania congressional district held in March that were characterized by widespread media coverage.
For more than a decade, this place has been occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump has won the region by 20 points.
Political experts give a small advantage to the democrats.
The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then resigned.
Diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump organization's management team.
The State Department's official representatives have decided to withdraw U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," Héder told Reuters.
But only in relation to El Salvador were penalties taken into account, which received U.S. aid of about $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the country in Central America and the high rates of unemployment and murder in it.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed the high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in the effort to stop the fighting.
But by the middle of September, senior administrative representatives had stressed that they wanted the conference to progress and effectively put an end to any thinking about punishing El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to address the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
The three U.S. officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. representatives, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations about the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an external analyst who was close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn the history
The next thing that could happen is the publication of Special Counsel Robert Miller's report on a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, which at the moment there is very strong evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller is also reportedly directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign is linked to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to bear responsibility in that body as he prepares to appear again before voters, and possibly even before a jury composed of his colleagues.
There is a lot of uncertainty here and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Mr Trump is inevitable, nor his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic should make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler if the West resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed to do so and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the unstoppable march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
The United States is now faced with a number of such points of change.
What would we do if Mr. Trump gave up Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on the hot seat since this newspaper reported last year that he had secretly proposed to shoot the president and speculated that he was unfit for the function he was performing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is inaccurate.
“What if Brett Cavano’s new investigation requested by the FBI is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And first of all, will we vote in the midterm elections for Congress, which will blame Mr. Trump?
If we fall on all these tests, democracy is waiting for a long winter.
But I don't think that's going to happen because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on a table with a swastika logo.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorans of the Rangers with an optimistic attitude in the face of a clash with Rapid Vienna
"Rangers" are hosting the clash with "Rapid Vienna" on Thursday, but are aware of the fact that after an undefeated match against "Villarreal" in Spain earlier this month the victory over the Austrians will strengthen their position to qualify for Europe.
Graham Dorens, the middle-order player due to a knee injury was prevented from appearing in the season all the way to the undefeated 2–2 game with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use that result as a springboard to bigger achievements.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We entered the game believing we could achieve something and came back with a winning point.
Maybe we could give a little more in the end, but the unsolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we gave our best in the second half and we were better.
On Thursday we have another big European night ahead of us.
I hope that we will win three points but it will be a difficult game because they have had a good result in the last game, but I am sure that with the support of the fans we will return and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a tough year considering everything that happened, namely my injuries and changes to the club itself, but now there is some positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that now we can move forward, leave last season behind us and achieve success.”
Women can’t sleep at night because of this fear associated with retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they wanted to be concerned, few spoke with members of their family about it.
About half of the participants in the study, conducted by Nationwide, said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
This is where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide you with care if you don’t share your wishes with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and talk about where and how you can get care because such choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Include your financial advisor as well: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Your options for financing long-term care can include a traditional long-term care policy, a cash-worthing life insurance hybrid policy, which can help you cover your expenses or provide your own self-insurance with your own funds.
Mediate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the very beginning.
Take out full health care so that you can empower a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that healthcare professionals respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate with them.
Also, think about the power of your financial resources.
In this way, you would choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your older parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to a hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the drugs he drinks and his allergies?
Note these details in writing so you can be prepared for them.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.

Man shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he returned home from his departure.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracomb when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST (British summer time) as "a random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police are appealing to the witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of casualties expected to rise.
Due to the interruption of communications, aid workers are unable to obtain information from Dongala County, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a district that stretches for more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) on the coast in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The county, which represents an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Watering nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Indonesia's disaster relief agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in the Dongal.
Tsunami also hit western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were residents of Akhtar.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing tsunamis that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake strikes the area near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis that reached 10 meters and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focus earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya district of Aceh, causing desert and panic as it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on family violence charges
Trek Palin, the eldest son of former Alaskan governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Vassila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in a report of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by police officials in Alaska.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he picked up her phone.
Palin is in the Mat-Su detention facility with the option to leave if he pays a $500 fine, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when asked how he was pronounced in court, a statement from the network said.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he could be sentenced to prison for up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a B-class felony, a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the Alaska Veterans Court is ongoing.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference in the report of a criminal case of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she said her son's violent behavior stems from PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes in the area.
Electricity and communications networks have been disrupted, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the area near Central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulated on which the moment of impact is displayed.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking rare death penalty for the suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sifulo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York in which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck at Home Depot in October to carry out an attack on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and to overtake the pedestrians and cyclists who found him on the road.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the intent to seek a death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, there is an opportunity to pronounce a death penalty on both these grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury launched an indictment against Saipov on 22 grounds, including eight counts of murder for the purposes of racketeering, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of violence and murder.
To carry out the attack, it took "detailed planning and thought," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as "grossed, harsh and distorted."
"Saifulo Habibulaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov's Challenge, Injury, Damage and Loss of the Families and Friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Lore Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlej, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferrucci, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Diego Men
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since a death penalty case was found in New York's Southern District.
The accused, Calid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage for the Soviet Union over the course of two years.
They were both sentenced to death by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he had asked to put the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He said he was innocent on all 22 grounds of the charge.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accept a confession of guilt and sentence a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved in them," Paton said.
Saipov’s defense had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek a death penalty.
A member of the party "Tori" says the biggest Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today during a protest at the party's "Tori" conference promises to "mobilize the people's army".
The former leader of the Ukip party said politicians must "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics, with one of Theresa May's deputies suggesting he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative supporter Peter Bonn on the Birmingham march said the UK would have been "out of the EU" by now if Farage was a Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Ms. May with regard to the merger of her deeply divided members was highlighted by the anti-Brexit members of the "Tori" party who joined a special protest against Brexit held in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue with the implementation of the Chekers plan in addition to attacks by pro-Brexit individuals, counter-Brexit individuals and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she would continue efforts to reach a deal with Brussels despite strong reactions and that she would force Eurosceptics and members of the Labour Party to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bon told the pro-Brexit meeting “Leave Means Leave” in Solihull that he wanted to “reject the plan from the Checkers.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge of the negotiations, we would have been out of the EU by now,” he said.
A Wellington envoy added: "I will support Brexit, but we must reject the plan from the Chekers."
Expressing his position against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subdued now.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Bonn rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the vote in 2016: “The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to stay in the EU is completely false.”
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the "Tory" and pro-Brexit party, was also present on the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Plan of the Checkers is not well-accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well-accepted by our party and our activists who are actually the ones who go out on the streets and to whom our election victory is due.
Please give up the Chekers plan and start listening to us.”
In a targeted message to Ms. May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to hand over the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them that ‘we’re not going to let you get away with it.’
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of handing over Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has enabled us to win in Brexit and that will not stop until we become independent, self-governing and proud of the United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, counter-Brexit faces marched through Birmingham, before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
After the group’s meeting, a small number of activists appeared this weekend wearing banners with the inscription “The Turks vs. Brexit”.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the Conservatives about the security issues they faced at the opening of the conference about the party’s app.
"These are people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the necessary technology for Canada plus, for borders without controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to think carefully about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "think hard about running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democratic Party representative from Massachusetts was talking about her future during a town assembly in western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, an honorable critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Representative Jeff Dill, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holiok was her 36th meeting with voters since Trump came to the presidency, with the holding of which uses the format of a city assembly.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that it’s time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes putting women at the top.”
Arrested in connection with the shooting and death of basketball player Sims of the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Sims from the "LSU" team that happened on Friday was arrested.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Ditton Simpson, 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man from the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
“Vide Sims had a gunshot wound to the head and as a result of the same death,” Murphy J. Paul, the chief of police, told the media on Saturday.
Wade intervened to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene of the crime, possessing weapons, as well as shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
As a 192-centimeter-high junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 appearances last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 touchdowns per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closer to world title after the team gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel by his orders
From the moment Walter Bottas qualified for Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play a major role in the race.
From the semi-position Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the bench as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his fellow player.
Vettel got into the boxing first and left Hamilton to fight the riot at the end of the group, which was supposed to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the boxing one lap later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the action one by one that forced Ferrari's driver unwillingly to leave the inside of his free risk to stay on the side after the third move to give it a go.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the net and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round finished in seventh place.
He then led most of the race and directed the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish line and overtake Kimi Raikonen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered boxing in the 44th round, but could not increase the pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikonen came in fourth place.
Today is a tough day because Valteri has done a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
"The team has made a truly exceptional decision to have their own team in the race," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad speech on the body.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diana Fainstein at the rally on Saturday in connection with her insistence that she did not publish the letter from Christine Blassie Ford in which she accuses Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavano of being a "student".
In his speech at the West Virginia rally, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but made a comment that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "evil and dishonest and dishonest."
“There’s only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what’s happening in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and angry and ruthless and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at announcements and leaks of information and they say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diana Fainstein, have you published this information?
Do you remember her answer... did you publish the document – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t publish it.”
Wait a minute, then.
Did we publish it... No, we didn’t publish it,” he added, imitating the senator.
A letter of information was sent to Fainstein regarding Ford's charges against Cavano as early as July, and the same was published in early September, but Fainstein denied that the leak of information came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t publish her story,” Fainstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she asked.”
But it seems the president doesn’t believe her denial, so he commented on the same thing at the rally on Saturday: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was a really bad speech on the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body speech I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use citations to achieve their own goals.
“They are determined to regain power in any way.
You can see their anger, their greed, they don’t care who they’re going to hurt, who they need to shut down in order to regain power and control,” the president said in a statement.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwayne scored two goals for the Giants in the match against Dundee
The Dundee Stars compensated for the loss of the Elite League match on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 draw in Dundee on Saturday.
"Giants" received an advantage from two goals scored by Patrick Dwayne and Francis Bowielier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney scored an advantage for the host ahead of Dwayre to return the lead to the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bushar equalled Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nilsen to secure their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Kifi's boys, who returned with the victory over Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth encounter between the two sides of the season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, i.e. at 3:35 with the addition of Kendal McFol, the addition being secured by David Rutherford as Bovilleer doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the match, Sullivan secured the host's lead with 13:10, before Matt Mercart assisted Kauny to score 15:16.
The pair made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break, when he scored the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard returned them with a powerful game and goal, with the result 27:37.
Kauny and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nilsen secure Dundee's lead for the first time in the game late in the second period and he secured his team's victory half of the final period of the fifth game.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
A flight controller has died, helping hundreds of people on a plane to be rescued from the earthquake.
A flight controller in Indonesia is famous as a hero after he died helping him on a plane with hundreds of people safely flying.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong successive tremors continue to empty the area, and many are trapped in the rubble of the city of Pal<0xC3><0xBA>.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their own lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu, which was continuously nesting.
He remained in his position to ensure that the aircraft of Batik Air with flight number 6321 that was at the time on the runway would fly safely.
Then, he jumped out of the control tower at the moment when he thought the tower was suffocating.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision probably saved hundreds of lives, the Australian ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it in the morning before the helicopter reached Pal.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims could reach thousands, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigis and Butong is limited.
“It is believed that the number of victims is increasing because many bodies are still under the rubble, while many can’t even access them,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
Waves reaching up to six meters have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Quick help carries bodies every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
“Minimum markets are being robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get even worse.”
Indonesia’s President Joko Vidodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the National Army: “I encourage all of you to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man has disappeared after the plane crashed into the lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now says one man has disappeared, after it had previously stated that the 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
In a statement, Air Niugini said they could not find the male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane crashed into the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had missed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
"That's an extremely good thing," said Janes.
Janes said he and the others managed to pass through the water that had reached half of them and to head out to the emergency exits of the plane that had sunk.
He said that the stewardesses were panicking and shouting, as well as that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working near the port's reconstruction also helped rescue the people by using a inflatable boat to take them to the shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the air safety network show that 111 people have died in accidents on PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but none of them included the airline Air Niugini.
An analyst sets a time frame for the night when a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution ended by presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of the man who was accused of having a woman in Mississippi set her on fire alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, has testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He noted that he used phone records to link the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said she had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Telesis was with Chambers the night of her death, which is in contrast to her previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was interrogated on Saturday and testified that day he was not in town.
When prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth by saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lies because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Telis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Telis deleted Chambers' messages and calls, as well as her contact information from her phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense should present its final arguments in the week.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide on the case later that day.
The High Breed: What is a Conscious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to defeat the negative attitude about this genre by including positive messages in their music.
Bristol’s “The High Breed” claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins as a music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to go back to its roots and re-populate the conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" have recently experienced their revival through artists such as "Akala" and "Lowkey".
Another black girl?!
A New York mother-in-law sues a married couple for being fired after sending a "racist" message
A New York mother-in-law sued a married couple for being fired on the basis of discrimination after she received a message from the mother who complained that she was "another black woman."
The couple denied that they were racist, saying the lawsuit was actually “encouraging.”
Lindsay Plasko-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first working day of the new nurse Giselle Morris found out she was a black woman.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEW ONE SHIRT," Ms. Plasko-Flaxman wrote in a message addressed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, and twice.
After realizing what she actually did Plasco-Flaxman, feeling "uncomfortable", she fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly stepmother, who is African-American, did her job poorly and that instead of her, she "did not expect to be given away by the Post."
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Morris now sues the couple and seeks compensation for the $350-a-day layoff over a six-month period, a commitment that would include her living with the family, which she was originally engaged to, but without signing a contract for.
“I want to show them that we shouldn’t do such things,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple returned to the claims that they were racist, saying that Ms. Morris' dismissal was a reasonable procedure because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t think.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you trust your children in the face of something you were unworthy of, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Plasco said the complaint was “extremely extortion,” saying his wife had given birth to the baby just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
Are you going to attack someone who is in such a situation?
“It’s not very good,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public immediately condemns the married couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers won’t be able to relate to a sword they’re talking about, the new letter reveals.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it’s published.
It is very interesting that we now know all this about the huge success of Paddington.
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the book from a small toy in the form of a sword, would still be optimistic if his work were not well accepted, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "a waste of time."
For Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she adds that her father felt a quiet sense of pride about his potential success.
“He was a really quiet man and he didn’t want to fail at all,” she said.
But because Paddington felt so real, it was almost as if you had a child who has achieved something in life: and you are proud of him even though success is not due to yourself.
I think Paddington’s success was perceived in this way.
Although it was the creation and fruit of his imagination, he always attributed his merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was on the deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her by phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to the "Louis Pasteur 2" hospital in Nice, where doctors were desperately trying to save her life.
“I was constantly called to tell me that the situation is very bad and that it is expected that it will not survive,” Ms. Ednan-Laperous said.
“Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
And I said, "Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the drugs given to her by the doctors to keep her heart pumping was slowly diminishing and they were coming out of her system.
She passed away earlier, and this meant that all of her systems were aborted.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this is happening.
I couldn’t scream, cry, or cry again because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay home.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous lamenting the loss of her daughter boarded the plane along with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I shook my head and the tears didn’t stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt an immeasurable compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her.”
Women are putting cards on a bridge to prevent suicides.
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide are making efforts to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries put cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call to ask for support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, says her son had great potential to become a cook, as well as an infectious smile.
“Everyone remembers him with his smile.
People have always said that his smile can light up every room.
However, he gave up his job before he died because it was “in a really dark place.”
His 11-year-old brother was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after taking his own life.
Mrs Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid that it will have a consistent effect."
Mrs. Davis elaborates the cards “to let others know that there are people out there who can talk to and talk to them, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, you have to start talking.”
Mrs. Humphries, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner Mark to whom she was married 15 years after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt unhappy or depressed, that is, he didn’t say anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas Day when the children opened their gifts, and he did not look them in the eye at all and made no contact with them.
She said his death was a huge trauma to all of them, but they had to find a way to go through it: “That’s what upsets the family.
It's still broken.
But we have to keep going and fight.”

Brett Cavano's future is uncertain after the FBI began its investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually get something similar to what he was looking for, that is, an investigation with limited time, with limited scope, maybe we could achieve a little unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "crash into disarray."
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their fluctuation is due solely to the timing.
The midterm elections should be held in just a few weeks, i.e. on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man to be a member of the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush addresses the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Cavano, who worked at Bush's White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has released its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to change the undecided outcome and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea has declined under Kim’s leadership.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean envoy said.
Park Beyong-seug, citing data from South Korea's Unification Ministry, said last year there were 1,127 crossings at the border compared to 2011 when there were 2,706.
Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on people’s smugglers are key factors.
Pyeongyang did not comment publicly.
Most of the refugees from North Korea have been granted citizenship in South Korea over time.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them run through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and which can be moved more easily compared to the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them into force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on halting the denuclearization negotiations.
This was followed by a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal - the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korea’s foreign minister, Rye Yong-ho, on Saturday blamed the U.S. sanctions on stagnation in progress since then.
“If there is no confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” Rie said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavano "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavano "hysterical" and said that taking into account his temperament, he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman acted that way, they would say it was ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his introductory presentation, sometimes even yelling and slapping as he spoke about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony was evidence that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it turned out he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with those statements and the way the Clinton family and the Democrats attacked him," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if the allegations against him are confirmed and if Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he does not tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is not only not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, but he is also not fit to serve in the court where he is currently in office," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the possible judgments that Kavanaugh would bring against the Affordable Care Act or Roe versus Wade, as he is considered to be the subject of conservative justice.
In the hearings to confirm his candidacy, Kavanaugh did not answer the questions as to whether he would annul some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, addicted person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘That’s really great, isn’t it?’” Pelosi said.
Women should also use it.
It’s a really sharp criticism, months and years of gathering anger, which she can’t get rid of without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
She continued, “A woman who performed an executive function somewhere helped me a lot, and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she was able to develop her technique, so when she got angry and started crying, she told the face you were talking to, ‘M.
I'm angry."
And then she continues to cry.
I think it’s brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as a ventilated valve for anger in part because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my most vivid memories of one of my first jobs in the office where men dominated was when I once began to cry with unspeakable anger and an older woman, a cold manager from whom I always had a certain fear, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me away.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll enjoy the fact that they’ve managed to reach you.”
Patricia Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der at the time was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was caught in an offshore boat affair called "Monkey Business" and pulled out of the presidential race, Mrs. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she did not consider the idea of running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me 30 years later through laughter.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snowy and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given the fact that the campaign was started a long time ago, it did not have enough funding, so it promises not to enter the race if it does not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters, who gave her men $1,000, would give her only $250.
“Do they think there should be a discount for me?” she asked.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions, that is, gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that it was so difficult to raise funds and to target voters, and not to cut back.
“If you’ve seen me, you’ll probably think I have a nervous breakdown,” recalls Mrs. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der of how the media reacted to the incident.
“You would think that Klinex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember asking myself what they would write on my gravestone.
"Is she crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of the fire with the start of the U.S.-China trade war was deafening and despite the fact that the battle is far from over, the clash between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, gave the first warning earlier this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation escalated significantly this week with the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has returned to nature every time, i.e. recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to return to the U.S. on an equal footing, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will give up on it in the near future.
To make Washington withdraw means to accept his demands, but public worship before the U.S. would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, the pressure from the U.S. trade war could result in positive support for China in the long run as it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for the start of an abrupt decline from an economic aspect in any of the countries is far more dangerous than had previously been determined by the observers,” Abigail told Reuters.
Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild the country that has been devastated by the long war that has lasted for more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is stable and safer, due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renovate areas devastated by terrorists in order to bring the situation back to normal.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave due to terrorism and unilaterally introduced economic measures that reflected on their daily lives are now being provided.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomed aid in the restoration of the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe achieves significant victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team defeated the U.S. team in the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has so far lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the 1993 Ryder Cup title in Europe.
Europe has regained the primacy after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points that were needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, in his first hole hit, threw the ball into the water in par-3 at the 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all rounds, becoming one of the four players who achieved a 5-0-0 result after the tournament began to be organized in the current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spitt lost 5:4 to the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olessen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranked player, lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a participant in eight Ryder purchases, became the European who won the most titles in the tournament with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop myself.
This year was really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the title back.
The team game is the most important and I am happy that I was able to help," Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a said after Europe's victory.
He now takes the place of his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday defeated one-on-one Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, with a score of 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," Ram, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It’s an incredible statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking them after Jack Niclaus.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to direct the game to the low-grass fields, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furick after his team's disappointing game said, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
In the morning, we had some problems with the team.
We fought.
Drop down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, I will work with the Association of Professional Golfers of America and our Committee on the Ryder Cup and we will continue.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it.
They've lifted us up.
