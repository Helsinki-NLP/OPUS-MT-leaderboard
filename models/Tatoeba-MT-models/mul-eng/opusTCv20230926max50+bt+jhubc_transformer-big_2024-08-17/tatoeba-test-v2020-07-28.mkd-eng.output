It's really exciting.
She's always taking good care of her old father.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped brushing.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised he'd help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
It'll take time.
Why don't you go after him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're studying.
I'm walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I turn to you?
Do you like the wheel?
He is a lover of bread.
I feel like a fool.
Tom didn't give me enough help.
I'm not taking advantage of Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean to him?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We've only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them a break.
How much is it worth?
The water was up to our throats.
Tom pretends he doesn't notice that Mary is watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my dad.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
It's probably still there.
It looked great.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
No one knows this.
The drain was blocked.
Breakfast is from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Tom came back last week.
They were all scared.
I've watched it before.
You've made a good choice.
The nudists consider the baldness to be normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I was kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
That's mine, give it back to me.
The wolves drove the herd.
This song has been haunting me for years.
I'm working.
We'll make it.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is my connoisseur.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
Racist idiots.
Are you happy, Tom?
Did you shoot with a gun before?
I like that tattoo a lot.
You got a card for your pocket.
I don't want to surrender to the police.
You're mad at me, I know.
I'll give you some cash.
Can I call you back later?
I feel lonely in the city.
What have they done so far?
Tom's childless.
I don't live in Boston.
The government has complained about the damage.
No one has confidence in Tom.
The clock had a guarantee.
And we'll meet tomorrow?
I should've known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did Tom ask why?
Tom heard his phone call.
Tom did as Mary had told him.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for this job is great.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom realizes he wasn't a good father, so he's trying to get out.
Tom doesn't know how to change.
Tom said he wants me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have to admit something.
The alcohol had an effect on him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looks around him.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's a little broken up in the images.
No one cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would have answered correctly.
I have to help him.
He's being criticized.
You'll know when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom swallowed the mastic.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure that Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't hang with me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous, we're not monkeys, we've got a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually cook?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about giving up?
It lasted all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rough.
Sounds like Tom.
Nobody's judging you.
Stop making fun of Tom.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom was having breakfast later.
Can you help him?
Are you two relatives?
He wants a ham with eggs.
Just put it on my account.
I'd rather go by subway than by train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Shall we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did he give it all to himself?
Mary has moved the film.
She has a beautiful manuscript.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Then I wrote a report.
Are they buying like this?
It doesn't look very good.
Hey, can you give me that back?
It was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a moment.
Take off your hat.
The acting is very good.
Please, don't mumble.
I saw a ghost.
I'm in London.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
He asked me to look at him.
It's better not to go into a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do you really want to have pizza early in the morning?
Can you come back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He's wiped out.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose always runs when I'm down.
We've met several times.
No one liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is incorrect.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you'll understand.
Everyone is looking for happiness.
Has anyone else entered the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom treated me terribly in high school.
Tom was wearing a cap that was still worth the price.
Tom promised he'd help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
There's got to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what he wrote in a newspaper.
Tom said it was urgent.
I would agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if he asked for it.
Tom is obedient, and even humble.
Where did Tom open it?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're human.
You don't make a man with a skull.
She tried it herself.
Run! Run!
Is it paid for delivery?
I want repeats.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He has a weak heart.
Did you buy them for me?
You haven't seen one, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
Mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been delaying this for too long, and you've got tonight to finish it!
I don't understand.
That's pathetic.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We're taking checks.
The newspaper is a dollar.
How did it get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were witnesses.
You hit one.
Macedonian has four verb forms: pronounced, conditional, ordered, and transliterated.
They're not gone yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The calm surface reflected her drawings as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We are the champions.
Tom scared him.
That's exactly right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw trash on the ground.
I remember when I met the Queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom looked angry.
What will the Japanese economy look like next year?
That's how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you're not sleeping?
They give me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a seal.
I have to think of myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our yard is big.
It's a children's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back in six and a half.
Tom took me to my mother-in-law's pussy.
I didn't have an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show has to go on.
Make a scandal of good standing.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't attract attention.
I'd be unconscious for a while.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
He's not taking gas.
Tom's a tramp.
Who's on your list?
He has a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Get me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Shall we wait for him here?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you took Mary's flowers?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I go with you?
Tom seems pretty sleepy.
Tom's spending a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom regrets about is food.
Make sure you don't sneak into the quiet bar.
They both coughed.
The train passed through the tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That should do it.
Do you like tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
The sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the day they are going to try to escape.
They're all crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom's known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good series.
Tom's been questioned by the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
You seem right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got a dirty room.
No survivors.
She was supposed to shut up.
I'm not like you!
“It’s better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.” “Then why are you still alive?”
They laughed quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I got him a strawberry.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to get out.
Take Tom with you.
It happened before, too.
Who is the loser?
It's gonna be over.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than 100 people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
It was especially hard for the king to keep his mouth shut because of the heavy talking mana.
She did not accept the invitation.
Tom looked surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
It's too hard.
The weather forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels were desperately trying to submerge the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in prison than to run away.
He's lying down.
When are you studying?
Tom found it hard to swallow the pills.
It is worth quoting a well-known passage of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom's invincible.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by human beings.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't look busy.
We'll figure it out right away.
Didn't you hear me calling?
Go for a walk.
Don't overeat.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Take out the gripper.
I have no plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep the promise he gave me.
You didn’t like the award?
Look at the demon.
I'm glad you're happy.
They're being dishonest.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the star that's shining.
I don't know how to help him.
Hang in there.
Make him admit it!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory's up.
We're bankrupt.
Everyone knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me out a little bit?
I like the school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's no hole in his story.
The battle was short.
How retarded I am!
We discussed this.
Tom got the ball.
Where's the nearest club?
Let them call me.
A power heater heats the ceramic tiles from the floor of the bathroom.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll come back to me when you have the money.
The day came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires a skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of war.
In the forest, monkeys came down from the bushes.
Let's forget for now.
Due to the sudden death of his father, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're getting the data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll summarize the whole thing.
I don't know.
I couldn't stand it at first.
He's got his glove on.
I thought you wouldn't like it, Tom.
Even Tom still doesn't know.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he's not cool.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone left except him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you were playing chess.
It's dark.
The pipes are jammed.
I hurt you, didn't I?
Tom doesn't know how to drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They nodded beside him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked him to do.
Tom mistakenly told everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The deadline for reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I've been nice.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's going to help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We have to get out of here right now.
I'm ready to do that.
The water came to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
You need to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm crazy.
You're going to have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia really liked the concerts.
Invite them to join us.
Where can I park?
Does he care about anyone?
How are you to blame for that?
Tom drank a bottle of wine.
I fell off the wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in the book?
Do you mind?
When does it begin to perform?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are falling apart.
Tom told Mary to donate money.
I have it with me.
Didn't your name be Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But I lied to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom began to laugh.
This is Tom's school.
I'm not feeling very well today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with it.
Did she ask for money?
Hold it!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It is a multi-phase process.
I have a little present for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom ran down the aisle.
You didn't tell me it was wrong.
The mustard is really hot.
We advertise our products on television.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened almost thirty years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You were a great mentor to me.
Tom listens to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a cypress?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me in the head.
Is there anyone in there?
Did you read this?
What if they say "no"?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom was gonna panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
You're gonna have to leave her for a little while.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
They blocked him.
Tom's fighting.
Tom developed the map.
What is that smell?
Anyway, he didn't get what he was hoping for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom really needs his help.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
Didn't you know Tom was a coward?
Tom found me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that enough?
Tom stretched out his hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says the previous locksmith told him he would remove his nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Don’t expect everyone to share your thoughts.
That's what Tom proposed.
It's kind of wrong.
Tom's a smart guy.
Carrot in powder is a mixture of several spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
This was a tough night for me.
Tom was driving around town with a sledgehammer without noticing.
Yeah, anyway.
Do you want camping?
Who broke the glass?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to exclude Mary from the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom seems suspicious.
Keep it to yourself.
You have now, don't you?
I'm pretty excited.
I'm not employed.
My old English teacher is probably turning into a grave now.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, and they don’t feel that their own behavior is undesirable.
Wear high heels to make it taller.
Do you want to bowl?
I'm sorry, I think something's wrong with you.
All you have to do is talk to Tom.
I'm right.
Triplets robbed me for a month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't get me wrong.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me asshole.
And what does that have to do with it?
We're finally seeing each other, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house is not big enough for our family.
He gave up the idea.
I must sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was famous.
How stupid you are.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have a rule here.
Tom made the decision.
Tom won't be very effective.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used a lot of bad words.
Your coffee is energizing!
Tom was a nice guy.
It's a big mess for football.
Why'd you ask me about that?
I thought he was there.
Did the dog feed him?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom is writing.
Something very similar happened to me too!
I'm gonna make sure Tom writes his homework.
He no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to fight the idea.
Tom's really pissed off.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all see her behavior as reprehensible.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Avoid it.
His eyes lit up with anger.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to put your tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
Tom may have cancer.
If we work as a team, we can do it all.
That's what you're gonna have to ask.
He gave a word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready to go.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see I don't need anyone here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom's the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "Me too."
There are many birds in the forest.
Please let me stay.
Let's go on foot.
He just wanted to meet Tom with me.
You need to ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
Tom could be richer than we thought.
I never intended to deceive you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear, and ran to the window.
I know your soy.
I'm sorry.
I can't find the hotel address.
Smoking means suicide.
Hardworms, butterflies, and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to bring you this as soon as possible.
What trap is yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom gave up his knee.
Where do penguins come from?
Can we talk up there?
It is made of leather.
I have to rest.
Can I have a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom's wearing his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom showed up, and the crowd was shaking.
I think it's Tom.
Tom worked very badly, but he didn't.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink soda.
I want to find Tom.
He is also a writer.
I was about to have a heart attack.
I recognize the typist.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Bring her in.
You're cooking a frying pan.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going to be what she wants me to be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
He took five sleeping pills a day.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking, you know.
I know what it sounds like.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I feel so much better already.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
It's a shame the concrete isn't burning.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped all of a sudden.
My father brought me here when I was young.
What a bubble you are.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I had to keep quiet.
I'm terrified.
Tom arrived early.
He was drying his wet clothes by the fire.
He is always learning English with his knowledge of English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have blankets?
None of the pigs have disappeared.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What will happen next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
The car has four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom's packing his bags.
What's the benefit of that?
That's very useful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl was slowly shaking.
Looks like you're an unexpected talker.
Your prejudices save you a lot of time. You can form opinions without needing the facts.
It didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't eat lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Because the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be pale.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't hold back.
Tom's still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear it.
Tom smiled at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom thought.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your chain.
That's not a big priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
You get it?
I couldn't help her.
Tom was always getting what he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleans his room.
You know I'd do anything for your red eyes.
I was ready for war.
Tom licked the ice.
I'll never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
This is the first time I’ve seen this spring.
You want to play?
Why did he let us go?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is sweet.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom's having a good time.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Watch out!
Linda had a miscarriage and is suspected of being pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 in front of the main gate.
The meeting began more than an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll work as well as I can.
I've got money.
You can study here.
They didn't tell Tom why Mary wasn't there.
Tom fixed up.
Tom threw the gun.
Don't get cocky.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a blue dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything about anything.
The worst type of mammal is the emotional mammal.
Let's get serious.
The beekeepers remove the sachet to collect the honey.
I need to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget him.
Tom won the fight.
You brought them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary stepped into the room.
I'm fired.
Could you help us at all?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't seem quite possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are many big cities in Brazil.
I still haven't solved that puzzle.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom moved his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
It's not blue, it's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs usually kill them before they turn one year old, so they eat people.
Could you get a shotgun out of my leg?
I've forgotten how smart you are.
Can I see her?
He's wasting his money when it comes to water.
We don't hide anything.
Looks like I just didn't think so.
I'm not sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times that you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
The book is heavy.
Why should we find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom's lying to me all the time.
The rooms in the hotel obviously sound very bad. I hear him in the next room chewing a mastic!
Are you scared?
Please, feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the key.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you stalking me?
Please, talk to me.
Angels do not keep and do not lead.
Why doesn't Tom help us?
The therapy didn’t help.
My grammar is weak.
Tom was at his disposal.
Tom's going to town.
I am interested in Japanese culture.
This is Jave.
Who saw me.
Tom's getting closer.
Tom is the real hero.
Where did he come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
It's done the job.
These goats are on fire.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't even think for a second about trying to convince Mary to do it.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his locker.
Maybe we're relatives.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why are you asking?
It's not back.
Tom's sleeping tight.
Be smart and don’t tell your friends about it.
He was standing in front of her.
There are more exits.
Tom has always been very protective of his children.
I asked the same question.
We had to look for a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen chamomiles.
I'm safe.
The eyebrows look weird to you.
That's why I can't help you.
I still haven't found the time to write that report.
I can do without it.
There are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
He's dressed.
Tom threatened to kill Mary.
Tom couldn't be stopped.
I love to walk along the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom's blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this have happened?
I asked them to open the door.
Get down.
We need to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom nodded.
I can't find the formula.
You're in charge.
I'm 30 years old.
Honey, look at this.
You know, sometimes you have to listen to him.
You know you're sniffing?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use the dream.
What about the sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Give me the pieces.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was spilled with blood.
Who were you talking to, Tom?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
This afternoon we will eat cherry from Italy.
And Tom's from Boston.
That's a tough bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I didn't have three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's changing today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's a dead drunk.
I need a sunscreen.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unincorporated.
It's a good night.
They traveled to the east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The ceramides that fell off the roof were scattered.
Who is the owner of this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped her clean up the tub.
Give it to me anytime.
Tom's gonna throw us out.
Tom's not ashamed.
I'm just finishing the report.
Come on, hurry up, it's real.
You better go.
Tom pulled out the exit.
I have two machines.
What did you find?
Dan admitted to Linda that she was a heavy drinker.
It's Tom's drawing.
The game is not over.
Tom dropped his drink.
They stole my wallet on the bus.
Don't fight with me.
It's hard for you to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not here for you.
Did anyone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
I was paid to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary calling.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The amoebas are vital.
If you do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't have to mean Tom's dead.
The waves create the wind.
Take a clean cup from the cupboard.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill you.
I left a message.
Is that all you see?
That would be a disaster.
I like how the French write their word for "baby".
The elevator can lift twenty tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
Is that what you're up to?
We're pretty good.
The pork is cut into cubes and fried.
Ask a professional person.
I love travel.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom seemed to be trying to convince Mary to take something.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of nice.
Tom wiped his forehead.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters extorted a large sum of money from the rich.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
You're biting your conscience, aren't you?
I wanted blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that beard scar?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Get a hammer, you run your nose.
Tom went with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were originally farmers.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do something you're gonna regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely comes out.
We set up a tent.
I thought it wouldn't rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
Camoli would have stayed.
She has ten children.
Tom stopped me.
You look very nice, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
I'm pretty healthy now.
Tom was still dressed in pajamas and a bathrobe when I came to the bathroom.
We've all read that.
Get over there.
You're back.
The sentence is not exactly grammatical.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Is there any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary's first teacher.
In the middle of the city there is a fountain.
You have to help her.
The reader will quickly realize that my analysis is accurate and that its results are more reliable.
I tried.
A broken tree was blocking the way.
Don't interrupt Tom.
There were no more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my efforts have failed.
Mathematics is the best way to go.
They were so happy together.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
He put his head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't like that.
Did you see the rope this morning?
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom wants to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Alice.
He hurt me and called me a jerk.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were passengers.
I think Tom's upset.
Some fish know how to change their sex.
I can take it from her.
Bring some food.
Maybe it'll be hard.
I don't curse the kids.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do that.
It makes us work too much.
Slow down.
He wants every wedding to be the bride and every funeral to be the death.
Tom's probably okay.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
You want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised when he saw Mary with John.
Have a nice evening.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Wet climate conditions are not characteristic of the peninsula.
Tom knew Mary was going to help him.
Tom's never there.
Please give up on yourself.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom pulled out the pen.
Why should I care what you do?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long does it take to take this medicine?
I don't need a bed.
Don't put us on Facebook!
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was “yes.”
Lovers who are truly happy don’t write down their happiness.
I still don't know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please, show me more.
I've got to get my house covered.
We didn't make it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I'm studying English.
What is usually the cause of the pain?
We depend on work.
The box is made of kale.
She dropped the test for a reason.
Trust her in her intuition.
He can't do that.
You didn't listen.
Tom's angry.
Try not to pay attention to Tom.
Mix all the ingredients in the bowl.
There was a lot of semen; there was a lot of sperm.
Tom's very bored.
I was vaccinated against the flu.
Just try it.
I want to play, too.
Tom was a piano professor.
Tom was the only one.
Is Tom interested?
Here I am.
I'd like to do a little moubeth with you for Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I'm never a surfer.
I'll find something.
We ate gastric soup.
We can work in the open, if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's jewels.
That cake is caloric.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I blame Tom.
We'll be able to sit down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
I've been told you know how to do this.
You're experienced.
What's not hidden from her?
It's not usually a pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom was upset.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I've got a car.
I'm not a coward.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So, these are the weirdest prisoners I've ever seen.
I spend most of the day here.
Shall we wait for her here?
If you come out so hungry, you'll get cold.
Does it still hurt?
It was pretty funny.
I set it up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did Tom say anything?
Are you all busy?
They don’t want people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom was hurt.
Where was last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We did a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Give me the wine.
All shops are closed.
You made white again!
Stop knocking the fuck out.
Tom's done with the gardens.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
Unnecessary drama.
We believe in God.
We have to take everything we need to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom get along with the co-workers?
It smells like cheese.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you some advice.
No matter what you do, always give your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom is a responsible adult.
I can't call them home.
You're a racist.
I've already forgiven you.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow I still can't believe it.
What is short?
Thank you for coming back.
It's Mom.
The wounded soldier was barely able to walk.
The sun has just risen.
I actually know the answer to that question.
Why don't you hug me?
What's stopping Tom from doing it again?
Tom often takes down movies.
I was beautiful.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
The light comes out of the water.
Tom sucks the soup.
I'm not fucking you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom examined the subjects on the table.
The police threw Dan in jail.
Go back to your places.
Can I touch you?
You missing something?
Let a man sit and cry.
Do you have any plans to help him?
We walked among the trees.
Anyway, I'll do it.
I knew you'd be standing by Tom's side.
They couldn't have avoided them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call them.
Pray to the Lord, not to his prophets.
Tom acted like a knight.
We're stuck with him now.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch this afternoon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been cultured.
Have fun, Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
She was pouring her beard with a hose.
I'm sorry, but my answer has been denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is not to give Tom any gifts.
Tom was a hard worker.
Tom lived right next to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She has short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
He got down on his butt.
Can I come up with something?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'll go with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's see.
The Europeans want to drink wine.
My husband is a good man.
He has a lot of debts.
She knows the most important cities.
What's under the cover?
No one wants to play with her.
Tom's on all their drinking tours.
Are you ready to go?
Tom was obviously crazy.
Tom came to them.
You think you can trick me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
It can't be him.
Tom probably didn't want to say that.
Who needs a rhetorical question?
Mary was very proud of her body.
The teacher is teaching.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I'm carrying my passport.
It was a masterpiece that they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she'll be back.
I don't have a pen.
When should we start caring?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom wants vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship had sunk elsewhere.
Did you buy the medicine?
Did Tom drink?
It hurts my job.
The question is who will do it.
I'm leaving for Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Are you all happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget it, okay?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's pissing me off.
That's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would really like to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please, ask me anything.
Hey, what's up?
I'm not shy.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom's a Wonderkind.
He's walking to school.
It’s starting to get in our heads that we can’t ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very imaginative.
Now the question is what we should do.
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
He finished in fourth place out of 56 runners.
Don't get me wrong.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a child, he became obsessed with the girl who lives on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
That sounds very good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom irritated Mary's silence.
They'll be there soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my quarters.
They didn't act fast.
I'm weak.
Knit wave sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever, unless someone kills them.
I don't want to hang out with Tom.
You'll never be accepted into that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is Tom looking for them?
Here's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom didn't show up.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me on purpose.
The animals are in danger.
Tom made a proposal.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the door open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them about it.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has enormous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened carefully so we wouldn't miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so worried tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We're exaggerating.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late to make amends.
Is the house finished?
Tom's jokes are bleak, and they get even better as soon as he drinks a few beers.
You have kind eyes.
You don't understand business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
If he did, he'd get better... when the warts give birth to grapes.
Tom's an advisor.
Can I talk to you?
He insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Since when is there a fire?
It could be Tom alone.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom loves him just as much as you do.
I didn't release anything.
I was thinking about you yesterday.
I know where to look for them.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
My hair is falling out.
The big question that no one has found an answer to, including me and myself, despite thirty years of research into the female soul, is, “What do women want?”
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn’t.
The villagers are reaping the harvest.
Tom won't like it.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the failure?
I can work anywhere I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did he ask her to leave?
Hold on to your promises.
I asked everywhere.
What was the subject?
In every division, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Is it over your head?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was ugly.
Tom needed some advice.
My laser printer knows how to scan pictures, too.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe it?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that picture is.
They're all done.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
You keep me lucky!
The concert ended with the folk anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not moving.
Wait a second.
I have something to do.
Your propaganda isn't interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Every shade is lost in the translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I don't have any comments.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's plenty of air here.
She's married to zero.
The wind is blowing.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to wear anything fancy.
The old man was hanged before he died.
I don't like the book.
Fortunately, I hit him.
What would Tom ask that for?
The Sun is a star among billions of others.
I got the chips.
Can someone help me?
We'll go in the afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to beat Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you ask Google for it?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't worry about me, Tom.
How old is the TV?
The mystery is solved.
Tom was taken to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, here's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I'm looking for.
Are you sure we don't have to order first?
One who can hear butterflies how they laugh knows and what the clouds taste like.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom's gonna bow down.
Just find them.
I can't go out with them.
They pulled the trigger to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not to wait like goods!
But if I were in Brazil, I would be much more scared.
Have you worked as a bartender before?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it at all.
I'm just out of work.
Where will the product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food has cooled, heat it in the microwave.
The flow is to the right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want to get my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he had saved.
I think it's time you left.
He's a bandit.
Tom could've seen it.
Tom's a little dog.
Tom's very immature.
What's the matter?
What is the volume of the cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's drunk.
Your company accepted me.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants revenge.
Tom stuck a fork in the switch.
Will I be replaced?
I need to find some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
Cats are like tits.
Dan seduced Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems shocked.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, not you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
He's about to turn back.
This will make our job much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would he leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian to her.
I'm on vacation here.
He has wine.
His feelings were not returned.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral marches.
We're probably lying to each other.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to take on much about it.
I like this.
Suck up the sleeves.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles are there from here to Boston?
That's what I like about it.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisons Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a lot of questions.
Who's running this thing?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It'll get even colder.
What are you drinking?
As it came, so it came.
His legs had been broken.
Tom picked up his keys.
It's all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me a place on the map?
Tom's unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went on a hike.
Look ahead.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Is Tom bothering you?
This is my latest review.
I haven't been well in two days.
It's a waste of blood, it's too easy to wrap.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have figured it out.
Tom doesn't know what the difference is between a stomach and an ass.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
Rainfall doesn’t come in handy.
I'll tell them to leave right now.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got a saloon.
There was no soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was chasing Mary with a fucking egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of shingles poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I want to watch porn with lesbians.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure that John writes his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom takes care of it right away.
I have no feelings for her.
Looks like I was expecting a little better.
I already believe it.
She writes a letter to her mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom said he was surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to cross the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was borrowed.
We want to know about them.
Have a good time.
The old house has a certain charm.
This topic is taboo.
We barely survived.
Did they hire you?
Gas leaks.
Tom could see that Mary was sending messages.
You'll get better.
Tom was a little shocked.
Let's do this right.
You can cruise all year in Hawaii.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most people think that computers will never be able to think.
What a coward I am.
Brother, you can't just come to a woman and grab her - that counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I love her.
Find your own supernatural power.
I'm the first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's seated.
You can't do what's right for you.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I go on?
He was smoking a lot.
I'm a patient man.
That's not happening here.
It is better to be an optimist and to lie than to be a pessimist and to be right.
The water was soft.
I'm waiting for the semaphore to change.
The boy was silent.
The body of the ship is divided into several water-permeable parts.
Because of what he's cooking for you, I'm gonna wash the dishes.
Let's leave the subject.
Tom knows something he doesn't tell us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your condition.
There are false beats.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the snoring?
I'm not gonna wait for them.
You don't have to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Oh, no!"
He's not as shy as he was anymore.
Contash?
Don't make a scene now.
What was told to Tom?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom's never been mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
Everywhere there were boys divided into groups. Some played mosques, some playing tiles, some with a ball. Others rode a wheel or saw wooden horses.
Doubts destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk in the bottle yet.
We both need to go.
The pain that causes love is the result of any pleasure.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
You have to go home.
Let's go over there.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We have to find her.
You misjudged her.
Wait till I check the manual.
The energy comes from within.
No one believes them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He shook his head.
We're screwed.
Return the seat.
What's his name?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want to get my job back.
This is not normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom's starving.
I can't find the equation.
Listen to the concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please, keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm angry.
It's less humid today than it was yesterday.
It's hard for me to make new friends.
It's strange how people in the tropics eat spicy food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Don't you have anything to do?
Tom had no family.
I can't figure out what the baby likes, because it points to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is real love.
Can you look at me?
Although he is rich, he is not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom caught a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go get Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim has never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
That's a false trail.
Tom was fighting.
I said maybe he'll come back.
I need you to open my door.
I saw it.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this has happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Somebody's singing.
Do you know how to fix the wires?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're handy?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Her skirt has a slit on one side.
Let's delay something.
I'll be right out.
What is your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing fine.
She can’t read or write.
Tom, you hurt your leg.
Come on in.
Tom and I had a deal.
They're all waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We've all noticed that.
You have very nice lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna be out of jail sometime.
The most expensive thing is the land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of the things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did he use my knife?
Milk is acidic.
We're running out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why are you resisting?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy the temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father, he's my cousin.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Let's see how much money we'll need next year.
I lit a cypress in the dark.
How much does she cost there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you getting up at 6:00?
Tom sat down again.
What country is Boston located in?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of a computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had inflammation of the lungs, I was just sneezing in my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me yet.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom was playing the piano.
I'm clean.
I ate a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You've just heard.
Tom's got a headache.
Oh, no.
There's no one.
That's not advisable.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to give up.
He gave everything of himself.
He's a scoundrel.
First, let's talk about what Tom needs to do.
My mom's buying me a toy.
I'm not taking that risk.
This house needs to be repaired.
I'm impressed, Tom.
Tom's a runner.
Tom's not listening.
They want everything you told them you'd give them right away.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, men and women are very different.
I go fishing every week.
What did you decide?
Is that necessary?
Tom's behind.
I'll never love you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well dried up.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe it's best if you call them.
Some people don't like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Is your dog barking?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German fries a lot.
We were 18 years old then.
I make thirteen dollars an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I love to eat, but I hate carbs.
I get upset when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom's running.
Go on with it.
This is repulsive.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They're drunk.
Tom began to complain.
I think you should choose her.
Hold on.
You're great.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Bring out the candles and imagine your desire.
Come on, open it.
Tom looked at Mary.
Tom was wearing a douchebag.
Tom looks determined.
I'm glad she didn't call.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretends he doesn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready yet?
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary doesn't wash the gardens.
Tom's a joke.
I've had a lot worse.
Tom tried to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Have you arrived yet?
I only had one drink.
No one's writing to me.
Tom's heart was broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm asking for.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to speak with a full mouth.
They're all out of control.
Every customer has their own rights.
I'm only calling to hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they looked at me.
I know Tom's address.
What was your last job?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I go to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
They're picking us up.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't throw him a lot of time.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom's not very cold.
It was midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change the shampoo?
Tom was looking around, waiting for something to happen.
They convinced me to give up smoking.
It's warm here, you can put your coat on.
I don't think they followed me.
They have no defense.
He often helps others.
Tom's a big pessimist.
You're entitled to a phone call.
The skiing was actually a lot more fun than I had expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home.

Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get that guy.
I'm giving my best.
I don't remember their debts.
I don't want to get involved.
Their friendship quickly grew into a love affair.
Tom's acting so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the forms.
I don't imagine a party like that, but as you like.
Do you think Tom would like to go with us?
Yoga originated in India.
Tom didn't let Mary go.
Tom's got his butter toss.
He's got work to do.
I heard it as a snort.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives there, on a hill.
I'll take anything.
It's not gonna be all right.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the children alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
Soon it will be Christmas.
You need to feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom seemed to be used to such problems.
You'll be fine.
It was all so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled mousse coffee.
He rarely went there.
Tom's wooden.
Let's sing and dance.

I'm bringing bad news.
This doesn't help.
Overcome the weakness.
How many glasses do you make per day?
I'll just sit here.
You don't have a random key?
Let's be realistic.
Lemon tea, please.
Tom has no business.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was suffocating with alcohol.
Tom's in trouble.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is heavy.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little bet.
I'll make sure we finish the project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
The music is universal.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
Don't let me come after you, Tom.
He won first place in the match.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan smokes marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
Yesterday it was too late.
You're screwed.
Everybody shut up.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad, what's wrong?
I gave up the plan.
It's not just guessing.
How do we find them?
It may seem strange.
No one can be saved from death.
It's not gonna help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times before.
Somebody open the door.
Do you own this?
We all hated her.

Let's do that.
Tom became famous.
I have a song in my head.
Tom saw this.

I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.

How can you help her?
Tom put it in a stick.
I'll turn to them.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to the chemistry, we have plastic.
What brought you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.

That gave me an idea.
The Federer of the clock broke.
I asked about him.
Tom says you like Mary.
Everybody, come after me.
This is a good place to park.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
It's his job.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.

You have to do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe that anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to protect the child.
Is that what he did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabs a gun.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I feel a little bad.
Who made the box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's get down.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me happy.
I hear they're paying pretty well.
Tom was a funny character.
Did you buy something to eat?
Boston is a great city.
Look at me.
How many liters of oil does it collect in a storm?
Eat slowly.
There may be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
Krushkova is green.
Tom said what he said to Mary.
Go find him.
He's in the basement.
Tom's squabbling.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't a Canadian?
I'm gonna scream.
I've just heard from them.
Tom's aware.
Tom, you've lost your hair.
They all sat down.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and come back.
I don't like to walk.
She looks a little young to get married.
I hate school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're about to start.
His brother is suffering from it.
No one could prove anything.
What hobby do you have?
So, I'm serious.
Prohibited speech during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do that.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Shall I give you a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write him a letter of thanks to Tom.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please, find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light went out.
Come on!
What if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to have breakfast in bed.
Dan walks his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned the lamp.

I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
It's very close.
We took care of you.
Experience is not inherited – everyone acquires their own.
I want to believe Tom was happy.
The fabric spreads a lot when it is washed.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
I blame him.
Did you hear about him?
Tom started talking.
I ran for an hour.
Tom's still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without a mammoth, it's gonna be hard for me to catch fish.

Public opinion is important.
Alcohol also reduces the inhibitions.

I'll tell him to leave right now.
Tom seems confused.
No one wants to touch this.

Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little more with the kids.
They all have drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He is a strict critic.
I've cured my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I have a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim, because it was cold weather.
You don't have to.
I just wanted to clear up the situation.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll call you.
You can't get to Tom's house this time.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life away from the Himalayas.
Tom's up.
Please repeat.
You're very dramatic.
Tom's lying down.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She had gone to school.
It is said that Marie Antoinette was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's strong.
Why don't you buy more than one?
We've been working.
But it's strong!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You've got too much to do.
Could it be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was voted Mayor of Boston.
Police found prints of shoes at the scene of the crime.
I asked the same thing.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom keeps the letter.
Tom would have liked that.
She's running out of half-naked.
I said we were closed.
The question is who will tell him.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom shouldn't be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Is it possible for us to come too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?

Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Are you sure this isn't made of diamonds?
You let Tom run away.
What is the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls who wear high heels.
Dream that you know.
I looked at her.

Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle for too long.
The weather in April is unstable.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
It's hot.
Tom was the boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut the sandwich across.
Can I see you later?
Tom's legs were cold.
The boys and girls are reading.
Tom has two children.
In short, you're to blame.
I'm surprised to see you here.

We laughed.
Tom was a little confused.
Tom only came to visit.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
I wish you a happy journey.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was oblivious.
Tom tried to look busy, so Mary wouldn't ask him to help her.
I rarely eat meat.
I'll go ask her.
I'm keeping his seat.

I'll call her later.

I ate late last night.
I just don't like it.
Plus, I can fly.
We've been spending our money.
There was hate amongst them.
There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
I don't want you to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I have never dared to be anything but who I am.
Sometimes it's hard to decide if Tom is happy or not.
This isn't heating me up.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Do you have any idea of a wish?
Sometimes children are afraid of the dark.
Stand aside.
I had to stay.
Tom's the only one here who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked Mary for money.
Who bought this for you?
Tom's gonna catch you.
My bags are packed.
Tom, get down.
I've got hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
There he is, I like him.
He crossed the street.
As long as there is life, there is hope.
I heard them licking.
Too bad I didn't ride a bike here.
I have to visit Tom.
What's wrong with you?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I don't wear provocative clothes.
This is classified.
That's not so much.
That's what I said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
Let me be damned!
I would walk alone first.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
He's not in the mood.
What did you get?
I motivated you.
I don't want to delay you.
I didn't see where you put your car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?

Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
You know that?
He's done a bad job.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's too much.
Who was the thief?
He has a charm.
The question is who decides what needs to be done.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice in the pictures doesn’t sound like my natural voice.
I told you this was gonna be a nightmare.
I didn't know if I was going crazy or laughing.
I'm mad at you.
We've been waiting.
Tom got up at 7 a.m.
I've always wanted a dog.
You're perfectly safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is whether we will be visiting next month.
The marionettes control them with wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you are.
The other girls beat her up because of her clothes.
You'll get confused.
I'm not following you.
Maybe Tom already did what he was supposed to do.
I'll give them another chance.
He just called me.
Failure has slowed it down.
How are you these days, Tom?
I can't stand watching him.

You're proud of the pound.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left his key on the desk, as he used to.
She put on her fur coat down, climbed up, and gently slumped on the door.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't see the same thing on the subject, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
There was something about Tom.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are delicious, but we're thirsty.
We were looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.
How long did Tom stay?
He's sending messages to his boyfriend.
Did you see any Tom?
He avoided the danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to repeat it?
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate.
You sound like you're relieved.
Tom is unforgettable.
Kyoto is an extremely beautiful city.
The handcuffs don't turn.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I'm writing my will.
"Why did you break my leg?" "My dear."
We were very close.
I'm sweating every day.
Give me your knife.
No one is defending my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked her not to interfere.
Don't wait for a big day tomorrow.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
It's just... it's just... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
Wait for me to surprise you.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet? It doesn't matter! I just found it under the couch.
He's watching TV now.
What's going on here?
Why is Tom crying?
That's a coincidence.
I'm so glad I'm home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can surround me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never capture my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
I wish I could be as happy as you are.
Try the sweater.
The cat stuck his claws in my hand.

No offense!
I was a little overwhelmed by something else.
His heart was broken by unrequited love.

You're my friends.
He's a carpenter by profession.
Tom's not as naive as many people think.

Fill out the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Is there such a word at all?
You're not a Canadian.
I'm really getting married.
They all rejected Tom.
You can't fire him.
Ken's collecting old money.
There's a lot to say.
I've heard what you're saying.
We have to face the facts.
There's no harm.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom scared me.
Tom sleeps on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can call you a cab.
You're not in any danger.
What can I choose from?
We have to put them in bed.
The only spice Tom puts on meat is pepper.
That's how I got close to Tom.
I don't want to upset them.
Tom was beaten.
We're really good.
He fell asleep while driving and caused a traffic jam.
I brought a few bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?

Where did this come from?
We're not ready.

This tooth is a cutter.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I'm not gonna hold my breath.
Don't buy him anything.

The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy it from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
I would do anything to make money.
I recognize you now.
I don't want you to say something you don't think.
I decorated my room.
This is just crazy!
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he is.

Did you find her yet?
Tom's there alone.
You did a great job.

I owe Tom a lot.
It was an amazing night.
The smell of jasmine and lavender is my favorite.

What is Tom afraid of?
Tom would have resisted.
What brand of shampoo do you use?
It's for playing cards.

What was she doing?
I think you should end up alone with this.
As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing on Tom from a medical point of view.
I saw a game of cards with all of them.
Tom seems to be trusting.
Shame on you!
Is Tom still alive?
Does Tom have a pimple?

I don't think I can move.
I'm glad I can be yours.
He talks a lot.
I'm not very normal.
I thought they found him.
Why not order a pizza?
The worse, the better.

Can I ask a question?
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
Someone just called.
Can I show you something?

My dad got a white-drop burn last month.
What a sad story!
Try to get a good night's sleep.
I don't think I'll live long.

It was fun yesterday.
Tom might be able to help us if we ask him nicely.
Tom likes to eat at restaurants.
Tom says he's used to hospital food.

Tom seems to be effective.
I need to be alone.
I can take it from them.
I read Tom's story.
Why are you tired?
Tom said he was leaving at 2:30.
I'll take him.
It has nothing to do with happiness.
I think you know the rules.
I'm really sorry about that.
How are we today?
There's your wife.
He's back at six.
Let the people go.
Tom didn't blink.
You're a good son.
I'll get you to talk to Tom.
I'll call them in a minute.

How desperate are you?
I don't know why I stayed so long.
I don't want to wait.
What is it, to be invisible to him?
The radio's off.
I rejected Tom.
You should be proud.
I am in love and confused.
I keep most of my money in the bank that's near my office.
Do you remember what happened last year?
You're gonna go with me and point!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
Everything went well.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know Tom.
Let's do our best.
I'll pay.
Tom may not be able to help us at all.
I'd like to sit down more.
Read this.
I came here a few minutes before you.
I'm helping him.
That's blackmail.
I'm starting to worry.
Tom and Mary work in the same office.
Jealousy is a sin.
All the children are strangers.
They shot me.
Tom is not prone to drama.
I completed twenty-five projects in just one month.
Tom couldn't walk away without looking through the key.
The tea smells good.
Well, I lied.
Do you trust them?
This column is not very vertical.
Let's see what happens if we let Tom do what he wants.
I'm very good with animals.
Did someone tell you that?
Why are you calling?
They were silent.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to speak French.
We have to go back.
I think so.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom has a little dick.
Tom believes everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going anywhere.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's as tall as she is.
They were hunted.
I didn't trust him.
You can't help us now.
Do you know how much it costs?
I thought we'd go to the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You've been hunted.
Let's go down the street.
There was no soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging your wells.
I have a few more minutes left.
Wait a minute.
Tom loves you so much.
You're cooking well.
There is no shortcut to the top, only to the failure.
Tom's pretty weak.
His face was as flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's paying a lot.
It was sad.
You seem to care about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Automated vehicles are now in circulation.
I can't make such a decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's carrying the capitals.
No matter what you do, you have to give up on yourself.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I got Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my dinner?
The organist was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you can help me.
Is he eating an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do as I showed you?
I'm doing kaygan.
I like the blue color.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take a bribe.
Don't smoke my coffee.
Tom gave her a stuffed rabbit to his daughter.
I think we should help him.
If there is no pornography with it, it will be done.
I called for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play crap?
They picked it up nicely.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it either.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a pleasure to spend the night with a smart, witty and beautiful girl like you.
I've been a little busy.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of her parents' control.
Tom's a wrecker.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you'd text me tonight, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess what.
He dressed up to take a bath.
A river of sweat began to pour over my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just fight that.
I'm learning math.
The keyboards are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How did you fly?
The movies are a great show.
I didn't see anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It is only a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love the jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests should we wait for tonight?
He's in the hospital.
Looks like I misjudged it.
I appreciate your help with this.
They all laughed.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
The flight was cancelled due to unfavourable weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom was sitting patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices heard.
They can come back.
I'm so scared, I'm so scared.
The whole board is against it.
The world lights up the sun.
His argument was logical.
Come on in right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly right.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had made a tree.
Oh, that's great.
Avoid the bad company.
The airport is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut off my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
The tape doesn't go out.
Tom committed suicide.
Tom promises to take care of Mary.
Mary likes to drink hot coffee, and Tom likes milk.
I gave him the wrong address.
I got together.
I'm not angry anymore.
There's a good chance Jane's coming.
I'm cold.
I think so.
I think you're Spanish.
The money I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom nodded.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did he make that up, Tom?
What's my lawyer gonna do?
The nuns are singing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'm really going to try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does Tom buy?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can anyone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's all quiet again.
It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Get down.
I'm having a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me right away.
Let me help you.
Tom has a problem with anger.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a completely new person.
Bring me a drink.
I think I'm upset.
The question is whether it can or not.
Tom's running upstairs.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I've done.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you were only dating girls who were inferior to you.
I have to tighten my belt.
Tom was about to collide with Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get hamburgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is not a place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I'm getting weaker.
Tortana looks good.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel, too.
What's the matter with you?
We want to see Tom.
Where'd Tom go?
Who won the award?
Please, come on time.
The Germans have a half-assed attitude towards the Goths.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they placed his body in a large tomb.
Women love men with heels.
Did you forget your wallet again?
Do you accept kisses?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do that, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud noise.
They both came back.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for one kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I didn't have any luck.
His body was rubbed with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I was very angry with Tom.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know it sounds na<0xC3><0xAF>ve.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants of the island are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always wanted more mysterious characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What is the hole with a hole?
Tom is one of the most famous American singers.
It can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't worry, Tom.
Tom wishes he'd never come back here again.
No one likes to cry.
She was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb the distant mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I would do that if I could.
Tom's really fucked up.
Try to explain that to Tom.
We were the first to arrive.
I already gave her your number.
Soap burned my eyes.
I'm glad to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary a lot.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's very informal.
This is not the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're studying fast.
We ate a lot of good food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I've been kicked out.
No one's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look through the window.
Mary bought some stinky trash bags.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He got used to working in the garden two hours a day.
Tom rarely comes out.
Tom got malaria when he traveled to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're so strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
You're good at remembering.
Can he do whatever he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We bring them bad news.
We have to go home.
Tom hit me.
I planned to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is still not fully aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
I think you already know the answer.
Could you not take it?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns the ship?
Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom was.
It was of great benefit to us.
What do you usually do in your free time?
I'll come to save you.
I have a stone in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked up.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was slenderly brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I never look for my hands.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't come into my room.
Taman, we've started.
I didn't want to thank you.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go in the mail with him.
What's his purpose?
I love someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got a couple of blankets.
I'm learning French.
Not to look at you.
It was too late.
I live on the lowest floor.
The girls won't be playing tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was inconsiderate.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's sensibilities.
We need to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need it.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's just leave him a little alone.
I've never worn a suit.
The grill is broken.
He's gone.
His clientele is mostly made up of poor people.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why is that bothering you?
Tom says he wants to do that too.
Women love men with heels.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
Gaile is for them.
People are dying all the time.
He's almost perfectly fit for him.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
He took out his sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom seems to be a little squishy.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom knocked on the door.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss this topic with you.
Did he ask them for money?
Don't speak so loudly.
She works at a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We had to buy another bottle of wine.
Add the onion.
We're old friends.
Tom pulled out his hat and politely gave himself up.
That's one reason.
Give me the book back, I need it again.
Marco thinks he's smart.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I take this opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very neat.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such an asshole!
Who's making him breakfast?
I don’t understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom didn't want to call.
Tom was suspended.
They were laughing.
She'll be a teacher.
I'm not going to tell Tom that.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom's looking crazy.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think that crossed us?
Maybe we can find help in the nearest village.
We hope it's good.
You're capable, but you're stifling.
He's been working at the embassy for three months.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom got violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this on your own.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's mad.
It's a job.
We'll make it.
Psychiatrists encourage students to work hard.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom opened the door of the car.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom is about 30 years old.
What's the job?
I see how upset you are.
All right, I'll order it.
We'll figure that out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan attacked two of them.
Tom measured his weight.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom has changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom looks a little shocked.
He's fucked up.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title "lady" was used only for nobility.
Tom has been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak in your own name.
Do you believe that?
How to choose a person only one?
I'm here to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I don't feel it.
My corner uncle was there, stretched out on a bloody bed, with a dot stuck deep in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
I'm being paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long will you stay with us?
You must be very proud.
It used to be so much fun.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You just missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I'm listening to your child's laughter.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are digging something.
Just leave us at war.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins in a row.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunderbolts?
Do not interfere with work and pleasure.
I work in Boston now.
Put a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll meet you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent has been revoked.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping me.
Tom's gone.
Tom got off the couch.
Don't be mad, Tom.
I turned on the fan and directed it towards the wall.
This is a homemade jam.
Tom asked for Mary's help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
Police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not exactly true.
The storks are small.
Please, stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm bored of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as I raised him, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank lends her a million dollars to the company.
I have a lot more to tell you.
I'm always writing.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what's important to you, and I'll do my best to destroy it.
Play more casually.
My son always interrupts me while I talk.
This Tom's calling.
I'll drive myself.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday, I'm worried about my head, I'm a bit of a moron.
Tom was having a party.
Tom said he didn't know what the guy's name was.
I'll get to your baby.
That was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have to lend me an interesting book?
Tom was moving cautiously.
Just come in.
He demanded a sword of steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and yesterday I studied the library.
I said my own thing.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose.
When will we see each other?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's a unit.
The woman called the man.
Tom found something really interesting.
They had a lot more than us.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
It's a crazy day.
I don't even know what it is.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't stand it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are as follows.
This is the pool that Tom learned to swim in.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait for me in the mail.
What college did you go to?
It is about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I'd better call him again.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It was much more than I expected.
Clear your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
I had a blood clot in my eye.
I went to see Mary yesterday.
Exaggerating her!
He has a son who's gone missing.
I'm trying to work.
What kind of taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling the show will be cancelled; they didn’t sell a lot of cards.
Tom's going.
Tom thinks he shouldn't use a deodorant.
Does Tom swim often?
The girl fell asleep.
Go write at home.
Don’t force your child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're laughing.
Tom paid me.
It's my pleasure to read books.
They killed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom seems to be upset.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their own flaws.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what he was planning to cook Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I feel like it's raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom look upset?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm grateful to you.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one suitcase less than me, they complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live at all? In some part of Eastern Europe.
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a moment.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in oranges.
Tom's here to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he'd burn the beard.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're very lonely.
Please do not add any comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
The clouds are usually accompanied by thunderstorms.
Tom likes tea with cinnamon.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I have a little temperature.
Tom cornered it on the ground.
There is no end to the lecture!
The cups are in the cupboard.
Give us some time.
Tom was wondering why Mary didn't want to mess with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while driving a motorbike.
We're worried about him.
Tom is British.
John and Eva are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the psychiatrist.
How come you still don't sleep?
Everyone knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
The waters of love.
I lit up the waste.
We've both seen it.
That would be uncultured.
Tell us where you are.
Tom's a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
In the tropics there are only two seasons.
I think I made a nice statement.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this great?
Tom said Mary's down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm in a relationship with the ex-boyfriend again.
Just get this thing done.
I think Tom's great.
Tom got a little question.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he knows how to play tennis, but he doesn't.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign above the door say?
Sit down.
I was thinking about your problem with Tom.
Her hair and how she holds her head remind me of Maria.
Don't block my way.
We're looking for them now.
My shoes are getting wet.
Tom would come back.
She's always doing the wrong thing.
In which country are you a citizen?
Trade in ivory is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet Tom.
I love dogs more than cats.
There's still some room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary has been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still doesn't know how to swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you took great care of Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
He can't stand the heat.
It seems these two have calmed down.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I really need you.
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have a broken pair.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You were brave, weren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't like it that way.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep up the work.
When are you closing?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you might say.
I can't handle this task.
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to the party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What kind of mother are you looking for in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree floats.
We'll keep in touch.
We're almost done together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary's name on John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits for long.
Go with the sticks.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everybody was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the sheets in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What did you wear?
I'll beat you up.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
That's right.
The forest was quiet then.
Don't run away from me now.
I have every disease.
She was oppressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought she had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to go soon.
Tom doesn't know how to feel.
There's a little more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The rope was making me nervous.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was it all just a dream?
I can't sleep, I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at the beach.
Tom turned into a pop.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is it so Tom?
I'm having trouble with the sinuses.
I had very low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's getting his water.
Esperanto does not belong to anyone.
She's cleverly handcuffed with a saw.
Turn it off.
I do not share my real name on any website.
They beat the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but apparently I was wrong.
I have three kids.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
He's been back a week, up and down.
It slowly recovers from the disease.
I want a vertigo.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Get back from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The mud is on the ceiling.
Her face was smeared with sperm.
Tom's fair.
You need to make this first.
We met around noon.
There's nothing I can do tonight.
Bring him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating an apple.
Is that moral?
You know what that looks like?
Pretend you've won.
I'm very confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was cold and irresponsible, so he was ordered to leave the firm.
I'd understand any of you.
Tom strives to become a teacher.
I wish you a beautiful week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom needs to go now.
Why did God make me so sad?
Why are you blaming them?
Go ahead.
We're being childish.
Tom was a boson.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom's up.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer. I don't care what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what it started now.
We're the team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Shayka broke the tire.
We made a tree.
This is so much better.
I'll get her to use your lawn.
Tom's doing it for math.
Tom took his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with my kids every week.
Tom has always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're broke.
Your sons are very handsome.
I know how much it's worth.
Call me if you can find her.
We ate a stick and a stick.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite the illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They knocked on the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think it's weird just because it's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was last night.
That's so terrible.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them an apple.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't have any benefit from that.
It still doesn't work.
Give me an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me back.
Were you honest?
The philanthropist was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't let go.
They're getting close.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
The vampire lived in the coffin of a dead man.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I finished my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be submitted?
Tom has a bruise on his eye.
Tom's company is under threat.
Did you ever do that to yourself?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates to run.
I couldn't call you.
Is that true?
I know you're angry.
When I was on my way, Tom was still on pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom is blurred.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary was going to be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
Unfortunately, I don’t have enough money right now.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, and you?"
The lightning struck the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
That's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They raised my salary again.
I'll never get there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom has work to do.
What should we do today?
Do you believe in horoscopes?
I know I'm going.
I'm contributing.
It was a real disaster!
Tom is good at his job.
I've got it all figured out.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom arranged all of this.
I'm not going to publish it.
The flowers attract bees.
The water is milky.
There was no plant life in this sub-heaven.
You're incapacitated.
What was Tom’s answer?
You will do as I command you.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did what I was supposed to do.
Tom's a long way off.
Tom wants to write.
Tom's very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, right?
I am interested in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not a scientist at all.
She's got tight numbers.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom doesn't tell the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and the poet travel together.
There is no time for explanations.
Will they arrest me?
Unfortunately, it violates all the rules.
What's your mother doing here, why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
A certain Mr. Kimura is waiting for you on the line.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound caused a tear.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't hold back.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must be feeling lonely.
What did you ask for on the internet?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
Our solar system is constantly on the move.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw Mary's papers at the desk.
Tom did this.
I am learning the history of art.
I don't quite agree.
What's on the agenda?
There's a lot more.
Looks like these two are in a relationship again.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom doesn't speak French very well yet.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
It is a moral choice of the translator whether to translate something or not. Certain things are better left to the language that produced them.
You're ugly.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to ask Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Check it out.
Give me the French key.
Tom seems to be worried.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's politeness.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun constantly varies.
Tom just told me.
Tom looked into Mary’s eyes and smiled.
It was very clumsy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could be hurt.
It's okay.
The stars are shining.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's a white man.
Tom could do better.
I didn't call you because of that, Tom.
Maybe it's already too late.
You found them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You will be known in time.
I don't know.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don’t have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're sketching.
We're going to market.
Tom knew Mary was going to like John.
Tom's a moron.
I just cut my finger off.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
It hurts my head.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would I lie to you?
He has a passive character.
Someone might have followed her.
My wife was here once.
It's a cure right.
We went to the beach.
I don't want you to mistreat them.
It depends on your decision.
That's feasible.
Tom's reacting badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages? No.
Tom was measuring you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're very cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
She was very pleased to have met her step-mother.
That's our best chance.
It smells like flowers.
Tom snorted.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabs a fire extinguisher and starts spraying.
It's for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak in your own name.
It resulted in great difficulties.
She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think they're framed for that.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
So we didn't agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't hold on.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
I'm stuck on my computer.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your wallet!
So the conscience really makes us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of them.
I don’t expect anything less than perfection.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't wear his pants.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You're wrong.
It's nice to see you.
Now you can go, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen emits a green light.
English has become my favorite subject.
Things happened quickly.
What evidence?
When we woke up, we were faced with some terrible news.
The knee wound is now rotting.
Clear your eyes.
Mary was scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't touch anything.
Tom is an agricultural worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to enjoy it.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
When did Tom sleep?
Our job is to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What do you eat, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a bottle of menthol?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I'd cut myself a little bit.
I'll get down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
Blood has now broken into his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't the kind of guy you could easily get along with.
I don't like pork.
She wants to run.
I need a sea cucumber.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best to stay here for a while.
Tom reads the note.
The children drew pictures of the sidewalk with chalk.
You wonder why you stayed so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I have to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom got married at the age of 26.
We've already cleared that up.
You want me to pick you up from the airport?
We play with the computer.
No, it's not even under the capital.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's listening.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom doesn't seem to understand what's going on.
Come and visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She wants to miss the magnificent chandeliers she has in the house.
I'm not a resident.
What's in your plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's happening right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm studying the piano.
They need the money.
He's swimming well.
You won't find us.
I've been listening to her.
Don't get involved in this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I watched TV when Tom came in.
You don't follow.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually quite common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you do.
Didn't I do something to get me mad, Tom?
The triangles do not have four angles.
There is not enough light to read.
Tom's counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned off the carmine.
Wait, wait.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what he told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let this remain between us.
I asked everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everybody's waiting for her.
It can be risky.
I'm a teacher too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon is coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
He found his parents.
He gave us a suspicious answer.
Wake me up as soon as he's separated.
Mr. Gorbachev, break down the wall!
Tom looks horrified.
Tom's signed up.
It's the way it should be.
Let's try to bet.
It's gonna be hard.
I don't like retirement.
Thanks for asking.
I have a good reason not to like Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll investigate it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are deserted.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter should not have been sent at all.
The girl who wears a scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This marionette is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna have much to fight about.
What's going on?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so loved.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
There's nothing urgent.
I'll pick it up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
Gaile is for all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
Tom's not my dearest.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom got married to Mary last year.
Tom goes to school by car.
Did you watch it?
I'll have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everybody's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Do you write the sentences?
It was a great series.
We have to go find them.
Last time I was home on Friday night when I was thirteen.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take down the trap.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing it for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's just the macs that got me.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to figure out a plan.
Tom's in no way angry.
Tom's going to sleep.
Let's protect our peace!
Tom's well armed.
We took care of it.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting starts.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them so much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to fill my thirst.
Tom arrived on time.
Today, television is boring.
Oh, that's great!
Tom found a four-leaf clover.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She gave up smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We decided to say goodbye to them.
You didn't smoke?
All visitors must be tested.
Where's that scar from?
You're nobody and nothing.
We won't find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds totally valid.
It's the law!
The water pierced the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please, write it down.
Tom's safe.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
Here, I want challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should've done that yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Be careful of the sparks flying out of the fire.
It's just made up.
Tom's been listening to Mary all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I'm always dreaming of you.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I'm laughing.
Let's get a soul together.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam as soon as possible.
We're going to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, all right?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three cans of bubble spray.
It was disgusting.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my dad.
The kids love cake.
He was quite restrained.
I could end up with Tom.
Tom's getting nervous.
This is from us.
In an emergency, what number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't touch it.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted that he had to lie.
Mary got Tom all the money.
Enough with the nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
It looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started coughing.
The butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom was out of work earlier.
We have everything.
I made him some cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the beginning.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say "hello"?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They ignore me.
Hold on to the fence.
These are probably fakes.
Beauty can not be determined objectively, but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is indisputable.
The girl weakened him.
Between me and Tom, it's over.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
He left me in despair.
Tom screaming wakes up from the nightmare.
Tom's kind of weak.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it over?
Everyone wants a lasting peace.
We met a day ago.
Where are you going with Tom?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom closed his eyes.
The tribe was not happy that a peacemaker was coming.
Open it.
Put on your suit.
You could be wrong.
I also baked a cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my advisors about what items to take.
I’ve already written everything that should have been written.
Make sure you don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
Now there's no one in the classroom.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's wheel.
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll tell you whatever you want.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in the room under this?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come on.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll transport you.
I set up Tom.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something to Tom in his ear.
Tom knows he's very self-indulgent.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom a lot.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do anything like that before.
You're very brave.
I thought I'd remember.
Is Tatoeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you ask Google for me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back with him.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're mannequins.
What do you want?
Tom found a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility for him is a burden.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I ate too much today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
Half an hour has passed.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was exciting.
I don't see anything.
He's a pretty nasty man!
They dug up their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom's acting jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and hung another one in that place.
Stop! Stop!
You want some cheese?
I'll call you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are by no means bright.
That was very rude of Tom.
It's suffocating.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got mad.
Let them piss you off.
Cutting is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay them well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom's in there.
At the same time you are both heavy and light, and pleasant and hot; I cannot live with or without you.
Let's just say for now that you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I can't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
That disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
How could I understand?
Tom's an asshole.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You didn't.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget it.
We have to find them first.
I'm running an account.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a blanket.
Tom's gonna kill you.
It's better to sleep with both of us.
I always use those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
The report is very well-written.
You need to help them.
Tom wasn't crying.
I wrote a book, and it was great.
Tom turned the quack.
I hope this is good.
If they lie about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I see ghosts.
I was tired and studying.
There is nothing worse than stupidity and indifference.
You're all going to happen.
Tom didn't protest.
What do websites stand out from?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're compassionate.
I hate patillas.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent all day cleaning up the snow.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to run?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
Is Boston far away?
They're paying me to help you.
My jacket is too small.
I've been denied.
I asked Tom if he could get it ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston by plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's misfortune.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll have fun with that later in the afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train as he went to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the tape out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that's attached to the jacket.
The goulash symbolises peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I will do everything for the good of humanity.
Did he really stay home all night?
Annie's music is beautiful.
Is she a taxi driver?
I'm probably losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
I'm falling asleep.
It has not been scientifically proven that there is a relationship between the character and the blood group.
She sounded angry.
Frankly, Tom wasn't working hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Don’t smoke too much.
Tom's a freezer.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We play on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We've been looking for them everywhere.
I really like your website a lot.
I'll catch you.
Press the button.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom broke up his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All the caterpillars carry eggs.
We'll take something.
I think Tom's tough.
You didn't answer my letter.
We calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad, do you like it?
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things stand.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Wait a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where did Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom likes adventure.
They don't have a bucket.
A lot of trees have fallen.
Lions are not different colors.
That wasn't right.
The answer is embarrassing.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look up there.
I want you to give my money back right away.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a great time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied to each other.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you marrying Tom.
Tom's acting polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote you a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed that he didn't have his wallet.
The woman was sitting between two men.

There's a tear in my right ear.
The boxes of cardboard are fragile.
My stomach hurts after a meal.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
They don’t get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promises to stay in his room.
I'm uploading the calendar to the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their suitcases.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
They didn't even take an oath.
Did you get Tom's invitation?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What is the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for her help.
I decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
The irons live a long time.
Tom's a strong man.
Tom's sleeping very hard.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk to me later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I'm running.
Did you get here by car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure.
Will you wait a minute?
You're among your friends.
You're something I'm weak on.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call him?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start again.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for taking me in.
Susan is actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer eggs from the underpants.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for the crazy.
Why would you help him?
Tom lighted his shoes.
We have lost faith in humanity.
Tom's dealing with the boss.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how am I to blame for that?
Why do we all hate each other?
Tom, lend me some money.
Am I interrupting you?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Look at how I do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom's got it.
Well, just let me know.
Most of the plants died.
Hold on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They're gonna get a lot out of it.
I'm a peder.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom wants cheese.
Is it okay for me to honor you tonight?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Come on down, Dick, it's time for dinner.
I'm on my way.
He was driving fast.
You can take care of my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's getting into the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come on in.
Is anybody sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses for a month.
No one's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you already paid?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom wiped his face.
What benefit do I have from you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
I get burned when she wears that dress.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
They now live on the floor under this one.
They believed him.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to his wedding.
I tried to explain, but it didn't work.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a type of mammals.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom might be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom's laughing at you.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to open it.
That narrows the choice.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to take care of his child.
I used the word "Alice" to describe it.
The third good luck.
We need to get out of here.
This is an air dough is popular in the Philippines.
No one said anything.
Let us strive for the good and give up the bad.
You're smart.
I am against projects.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I arrived too late.
I could have known Tom was really tired.
I'm never gonna win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There are reports of writing.
It hurts me here.
You're disturbing Tom.
Where did we go?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask.
Just watch it.
I was just teasing you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep and finish it tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Diseases often occur at the most inconvenient time.
The dog was staring at me like he wanted to eat me.
They were animals dressed in human skin and they weren’t real people at all.
The man is hungry.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
It's all past tense, but the beautiful memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom think?
It was really nice.
Everyone dies at some point.
I know how to stay calm.
We love the beauty.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I suggest we focus on asking for a way out of the cave.
They have no confidence in me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, folks!
The building is a wonderful building.

I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats have bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We fly over the clouds.
I really like it!
Is this exactly in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom gave Mary a towel.
She has big ears.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
It's a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like the way it sounds at all.
That should be possible.
I am a social worker.
Let me try.
I am not misunderstood,
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you've read my report.
Tom's backed down.
Don't repeat yourself.
The crests are rusty.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look really good.
He's unlucky, Tom.
Warm it up.
Tom looked like he was upset.
What else can Tom do?
I want to be physically and mentally strong.
She's a joyful girl.
If I could stay, I would stay.
Please, stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They started to go.

You always leave the wheel blank.
He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have professional experience?
I didn't ask you.
Let's have lunch.
Looks like a fool I was expecting you to do something.
You are my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two rows.
The headlines should attract the attention of the readers.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die first than step down.
I actually work here.
Tom's in pain.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like how you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I watched a French movie with an English translation.
Tom was laughing at Mary.
Tom is once again full of self-confidence.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother tells me that the child's illness is false.
Dan had a rough relationship with Linda.
They're all back.
Do you have a violin?
Give us a call.
Maybe Tom could sing to us at a wedding.
Who would you choose, Tom?
The hospital isn't that big.
Most people have to work hard to survive.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary is pregnant.
We'll stay.
I don't call them dogs.
I didn't sleep properly.
I love freedom, I don't, and I can't serve in a political party.

A lot of people do this.
I still can't tell you.

She was touched.
It was cheap.

Let's talk to Tom.
They love strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.

Don't pull over when you get home.
Tom taught me how to sing.
"What book are you reading?" "A novel."
You're burning your car.
That gun's not a toy, boy!
Half of the species are female.
They're staring at him.
It's for them.
It's Tom's dog.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to leave again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do a socially useful job to make up for everything I've done.
Tom tied his toes.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I don't have any tears.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom aware?
Tom's beautiful.

I was waiting for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't care.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.

We've got a lot of money.
Does your appearance match your age?
Can I have one?
It's not all milk and honey in Canada.
I have information on this topic.
Tom got involved.
Do you understand the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
Don't be stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
His eyesight is weak.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to separate for you.
I've prepared a speech.
Socks have a tough look.
I wrote it to them.
Last year, I lived in Boston.
Tom was messing up.
We want new carpets.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom laughed politely.
The kettle is pretty dirty.
You need to sleep well.
Tom's slumped.
They went for a walk.
This is his grandfather from his mother's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.

Tom's a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
Don't bother me.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom unnecessarily raises a jeep.
You deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not going to take the figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know what they say?
It hurts so much here.
I hate carpets.
A little bit sick.
Tom was interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he had left the cupboard.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job's done.
It's unnatural.
What did he steal?
Tom's never gonna finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have housewives?
He wasn't right about the picture.
I'll get it.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be kind to each other.
Tom's replaceable.
I think I'd better help him.
But you're smart.

You all look so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
It's going to happen to him.
Faith means relying on what reason can’t hope for.

It's a circus!
Tom's a wet man.
They asked to raise their salary.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't eaten already, I'd really like to handle you.
What do you need, Tom?
He'd say something.
The grille stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Throw the gun down to the ground.
And see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
We bought them those books.
That's quite possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's kind of smudged.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The fan is not working.
It's not my fault.
There's nothing I can do.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
Okay?
My day was filled with activities.
Is this yours, Tom?

Tom lives on this street.
You should go to the dentist.
The soldiers shot.
Tom can't stand it.
The store is closed.
She listened.
Tom came out.
That's all I can do.
He adheres to his principles.
Tom's furious.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
They split him up.
Tom's a great guy.
Can I put this here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll take you home.
Tom died of cancer.
What do you think happened?

Is Tom in Boston?
They're as high as an eagle.
You should pay your rent in advance.
Put all the trash in the barrel.

I teach Chinese.
Tom was sitting at the desk.

I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to make him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take out the mask.
It's definitely an option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm blushing.
I like the way you dance.
I need some.
They lied to us.
Tom is right.
Tom looks scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now you've got him.
It's white.
Sit down.
Iron is stronger than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
Tom got violent.
When does the show begin?
Can I just talk to you?
We're not gonna let you die.
Conduits are chasing me.
Tom didn't say anything about it.
It's probably true.
We had to go home on foot after the rain.

Tom didn't sleep well.
I danced.
You're missing me.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in a city.
Let's go wake up Tom.
How do I find him?
The ice is melting.
I'm bleeding.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
It must be a lot easier for you.
They never caught me.
I love my fatherland.
I haven't learned how to write.
Stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't insult me.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
The victory is bitter.
See you in the mirror.
It's not my job to cry.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom sent Mary to the door.
It looks very tasty.
I have to understand.
You two have fallen against me!
I've never worn a sleeping bag in my life.
Don't sleep in the tub.
Tom's got it all figured out.
Do you have a cigarette?

Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Make sure you don't mind.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers were wearing steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you guys talking about?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed Mary had caught the fish.
It's boring to sit at home.
It's not that bad.
They're slipping away.
Did Tom ask why he was late?
It's probably not worth the wait.
I have to buy a new row for the room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
You want to go to work?
I couldn't stand it.
Today it is sunny, but also cold.
What is it really about?
I'm not an expert.
My ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom's running down.
Tom gave a speech.
Tom and Mary have been gone since day one.
Let's talk.
The girls run and play.
I'm not sure Tom did exactly this.
"Aren't you going to eat the spinach?" "I'll eat it later."
This is my favorite subject.
Tom's slumped.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are made of real leather and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom sang.

You can only stay if you're quiet.
I want to know what happens next!

Didn't I tell you all about it?
He's not fighting.
I expect help from you.
Tom will go alone.
Tom only had fives at school.

When does it start?

What are you cooking for dinner?
What did you do then?
Take care of Tom.
It has fruit and meat in the market.
When she began to speak, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked in the other direction.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you lower the price a little bit?
I'll take a shower first.
Tom is now 30 years old.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She became a mother-in-law just a few days before she turned ninety-nine.
Is he looking everywhere?
It is important to keep in mind that no one is ever 100 percent.
He's gesturing while he's talking.
Sit next to me.
Tom's impressed.
Tom never lends money to anyone.
I'm really happy for Tom.

Do you live here?
The room looks like a carriage.
I'm not talking about him.

I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you need to know this.
Are you going to wear a mask this year?
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm not that warm either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is the act of refusing to forgive.
The door's locked.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm hungry for him.
She looks at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed how Mary was looking at him.
You're forcing me a lot.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice guy.
The eagle is the king of birds.
And then I'll call you.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you take a break?
You didn't ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's fine.
The sky has risen.
The alarm will wake the baby.
Just look straight.
It’s not something a person should be prepared for.
Tom and Mary play rhymes.
I've made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leaned on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think you'd rather have a son.
How did you get here?
He picked up the book.
Don't take my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do that.
Tom read Mary's secret diary.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked for two hours.
I found out about you from him.
I know you're upset right now.
He's gone.
After a long walk, he had an appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom served himself with a cup of tea and a cup of coffee.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how it was done, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laughed again.
The wedding must be perfect for me.
Tom was feeling strong.
The meeting has already begun.
We want to hear it.
I really like what your hair looks like.
Is it cold outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom's in danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom is an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is broken.
Tom is the tallest man in the class.
Tom, you're growing up fast.
That was our only comfort.
No one would have cared.
Did you write in a journal today?
I just want this never to happen again.
Can I do it myself?
Is yours a radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the key, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into it now.
Why are you blaming me?
Come on, Tom.
I'll try to get there on time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking bottled water can cause illness.
We're ready up and down.
Tom's got a hard ear.
I bribed them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't pull the plug.
I helped him unravel the table.
I ate schnitzel with potatoes last night.
It's better for your health to go up the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is bad.
I'm sorry I told you anything at all.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up in two and a half.
Tom's drunk.
I slept in the tub.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That's exactly what it can do.
Isn't it cold in your shorts?
Tom is the best.
He has an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever been to in my life.
I need a blanket.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know of any Japanese movies?
Did you catch them?
The French language was first slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We made them cakes.
Fingerprints on the knife confirm her guilt.
Can I wait for them here?
We can search in a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need guidance.
It was ironic.
I made you some cookies.
That can be done.
The Italian police are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I gave Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
Don't save the bell.
It's got me on my head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems to have stopped.
The fun continues with your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
How come you don't know?
It was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
The meat smells bad.
Do I need to know you?
Tom cleverly covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I don't care.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
In the picture you can see bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just kicked Tom's room out last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a dead coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell a dog if it was taller.
I'm going to help the comrades.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets a lot.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a coward.
We despise her.
He got in front of them.
Here, brother, in the middle.
Tom sent to the table the new mush that he had just bought.
Tom's going to help Mary.
He grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's hungry.
The landscape is superb.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under the bed.
I can't go in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We're gonna have to hurry.
Tom celebrated his victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'm going to try to hang myself.
Autumn is here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you get the driver's license?
On the water, it only takes three minutes to boil.
They could fire me for this.
What's the point?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was so glorious.
Dan was in a relationship with Linda for a very short time.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to enroll in a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should be treated with respect to one another in the spirit of general human belonging.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a bulge.
They kissed each other.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do it himself.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Did you see how it works?
The soup is salted.
Why don't you go pick it up?
Tom continued to exercise.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom's seen in the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend, don't you see how poor I am?
It seems familiar to me.
I'm jealous of him.
I offered to smoke his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
The basil, sage, rosemary, thyme and oregano are popular herbs.
We're disgusting.
You're an insightful man.
Everything seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He was sitting on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and books.
My brother and I shared our room.
I knew he couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of flattered.
Exercising.
She may have lied to you, but she doesn't have me.
Let's just grab the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
They got me.
Tom put his hand in his bag and pulled out a couple of coins.
The room was a cupboard.
It’s just a matter of solving this task.
They have to remove the bullet that was stuck to his back.
It's really fun.
Does Tom look upset?
If you can, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunshine.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect admits.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how much it hurts to get your som.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but here he is.
Tom doesn't have it because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom's busy with his research.
Brushes don't help against the ice.
I've been nice.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
I don't think it's a good idea to ask Tom.
My brother's gonna be here by noon tomorrow.
You don't have to like everything.
Are the potatoes caloric?
They'll get it soon.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary for the rapture.
I broke the vase today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'll go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't miss you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make his makeup.
I waited outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and grow up a little bit.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom was throwing a stone at me.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry, Tom?
Tom will be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They were standing in the street in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I have a few reasons in mind.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't quite understand.
Tom was stubborn.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
Some of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They're all double-crossed.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I found out that there is a movie called “Russians are coming! Russians are coming!”
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still not able to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many days until Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I don't like that.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
The deaf are the bearers of the plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's out.
I'll start tomorrow.
I wasn't honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write so well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm eating from Tom.
I like roasted bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while driving and caused a traffic jam.
We've heard it.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with a moustache.
That's all right.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is the camera used?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French very well.
Be careful not to overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don’t speak English, I don’t speak German.
It'll take us about three hours to get off the mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Are you done with the packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not act.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to believe you.
You're cutting too much for him.
The president announced that the United States would launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't borrow your book.
It's impossible to get out of a cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I too early?
That sounds really strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Watch out, Tom.
Tom tied his toes.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
You really do.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in the United States did not have the right to vote.
My neighbor called a firefighter.
Tom said I need to talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom doesn't listen to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Was that all the excitement?
Tom decides somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm's ringing.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there a conviction?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why he was chosen.
That's an undisputed fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to admit it.
The sky is a bucket.
We don't talk much.
You're a generous man.
Tom got a little wet.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer black.
Tom gave himself up to his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>, and Osaka is similar to Medell<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why don't you stop Tom?
I said I'd bring it.
Survivors are kind of suckers.
I'll start.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm cooking soup in a big pantry.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell this to you if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the wolf going?
I wiped my wet hair with a towel.
If an adult is lying to a child, he thinks he is always right.
Oh, my God, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck! Try your luck!
I may not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy the sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom was waving his hands.
Open up the notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the umbrella.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom moved on to the next question.
That was obvious.
I want life.
Tom's not in his bed.
That was all my idea.
I don't like puzzles.
A book will help you to write wisdom.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I thought you weren't gonna be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in his life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
Please, blow up the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates were laughing at her.
I'm sorry, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd seen Mary in a sabbatical.
I'm going to have to cut my cake with honey.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I'm guessing the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to get strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom threw his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one is excited.
I wasn't gonna be here for a while.
I made cake.
Look at the count.
I was impressed by your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What is that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it all off.
Tom leaned in.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
Last month, I had a bladder infection.
Look at the girls.
I'm gonna take off the sledgehammer.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I love the foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we gave up.
What's the benefit of that?
I am with the person I want to be with.
You invited me to your wedding.
Then he just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "All right, thank you!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick summary.
The door's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't make a mistake.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were completely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has a lot of good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You need to eat more.
Tom's not into sports.
Shouldn't we help them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom feels like he needs to get out of it.
It's a message for them.
When will I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom raised the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your shoulder.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not dating.
Where's the mailbox?
The internet is a serious business.
Mars is the red planet.
I shoved the dog with a stone.
Tom was staring hard.
It's seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
Damn, I wrote the book myself!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be fooled.
She looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were pleased.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you need to dig it up.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We're not watching.
Mahmoud can't stand losing.
No one's listening to you.
All right, convince me.
Now I'm ready for him.
It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hatred usually go hand in hand.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
I got my pants off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly over to you.
I agreed.
Tom admitted that he spilled the red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all freaks.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is goodness.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Did you hear about us?
We visited the castles of Lorraine.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little forward.
I think about him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I knew I hadn’t eaten yet.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as your soul wants.
You take me by the hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He is very passionate about his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
You're not alone.
I remember he was in Boston for a short time.
How much stomach do I do every day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned around to go.
Tom's kind.
What was the party like last night?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate to do this.
Dan turned into a beggar.
You've got a lot of piercing eyes.
Doesn't that make sense?
I thought he was tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want you all to shoot them.
I think I write pretty well.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Smoke and get inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom's acting rich.
Tom seems to be more confident.
Do you want to drink water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the amount is not accurate.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
The squares have four corners.
I kept working.
They developed dependence.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll wait there.
Can you check those out?
Give 'em a second.
They were sitting and silent.
Bring the shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary moved on to her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
You want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finished the mission.
Tom wiped the blade of the knife from the farmers.
Tom was struggling to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them turned to me.
I can arrange for that to happen.
Are you bleeding your nipples?
Just let me call her, okay?
Tom put his bowl of beer on the bar.
The devil is a believer.
I didn't say I spoke French.
Let's have a good look.
Come on, don't be ashamed.
I don't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far have you gone?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I'd better come back later.
What do tigers eat?
I'll just buy another one.
Will you step down?
Give him a dollar.
Did you have an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how this is possible.
He looked at me through the glasses.
Linda told Dan that he was screwing her.
Why would they stop it?
Let's not bother Tom.
The rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
Here's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to treat yourself dolly.
We need to be released.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Is Tom hurt?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
It came over my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has struggled with depression for several periods of his life.
You want me to take your bags?
I would trust that in my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What do you have to worry about?
I need dinner.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his teacher was in French.
The class is up.
There were rates of penguins on the sand.
I just left.
Dan called out a slapper.
I want to brush my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It is obvious to everyone that he is in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move it.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not impressed.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep in there.
I live in a small town near Boston.
I hope you'll like the new boss.
Did you mention the results of the exam?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom's got something going on.
She's studying English.
With such a tumultuous dream, he will become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate it.
They're starting to beat her.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We'll survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end the poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom shoved the chewing gum.
Let it be mine.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommended that?
How'd you get that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally won it.
How easy it is to get bad habits!
She began to behave strangely.
They probably won't pay the money back.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how her interest in archaeology was born.
Tom heard the sound.
Why don't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What should we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always misunderstand me.
We're just as strong with you.
The president seemed to be strong.
What should I buy?
Tom went to the window and looked out.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you'd better play chess than I did.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was a Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a carpenter.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is bent.
Grab the day.
What's the bell, Tom?
He's very accommodating.
Pay attention to the buyer.
Tom often runs for hours.
It's time for compensation.
Most of the girls have a chimpanzee.
You can go out at the end.
Why'd you just spray two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint, and when I ask why the poor don't have food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus had stopped, we waited a long time for the rain.
You're gonna make it.
Does she have a dog?
I'm taking a break.
Mary was wearing fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he was speaking French rather than what he was actually speaking.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture. The speaker was supposed to speak slower.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are getting wet.
This medicine calms the patient.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please, accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look stupid.
His mother is an American.
Relax a little.

Tom got sick.
Is there anyone else here?

Now we'll never find out.
Shall we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.

Are they all having fun?
I've been up all night.
I have an unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know it's yours.

Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister steal the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you take out the cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why would he believe her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at the place.
I want to be a taxi driver.
There's still no sign or voice from Tom.

Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
Their houses were built of stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I wasn't right.
I think we should talk about this now.
The meetings were held at intervals.
Tom was acting so happy.
I don't know English. I know some Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't even think about things like that.
There's wind.
I'm just kidding with you.
I don't know where that is.
We've all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
And I bought a watch.
Just sit there.

You were right, boys.
It's happening.
There were no other injured.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you'll make it.
Are you going to eat at home or outside?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll get worse.
Are you making fun of me?
I think I know him.
I'm drinking milk.
Don't be mad, Tom.
That's a tricky task.
You should make him listen.
I was surprised it was so easy.
I wish he was here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom often calls Mary.
Thank you, dear.
They increased the territory of the kingdom.
I didn't come here to hurt people.
Tom probably already knew about it.

This is a leather belt.
Tom caught a cold.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mother?
It doesn't matter.
Hey, listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him in your name.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these tips in mind.
His statement is far from perfect.
I hope we can beat Tom.
Take your things off.
Where did you put it?

What do I get from it?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't very busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for one person.
You don't have to be present for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin it.
You're very passionate.
I had a headache.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars, and Jupiter are planets.
You want me to ask him?
Give Tom a snitch.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that beautiful?
Hey, don't blame yourself.
Isn't that unusual?
I got out of the wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom has to be stopped.
Isn't that too much?
They know what happened.

Give him everything we have.
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you doing?
Now this is your house.
Would you like to try some sushi?
How are you doing?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life doing only what I love.
It's not my decision.

I am a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a printing error.
It doesn’t happen very often that someone buys a hat for a thousand dollars.

Actually, no one knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.

The bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan understood this well.
You want a cookie?
Who brought this?

Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
Everybody loves him.

It was a tough test.
It's hot here in hell.
I made it through.
This is your job!
Please come back to me.
Study here.
Congrats on the wedding.

I love you as you are.
It's funny.
He's going to relax a lot.
Keep your weapons in place.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was in jeopardy.
I wish I hadn't done that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why doesn’t anyone want to help us?
The hole's tight.
You should go help him.
Are you enjoying it?
I had a great time last night.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom let go of the sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you in the trenches.
It's nice of him to bring such gifts.
Shame on him.
They'll shut you down or they'll throw you out.
Go away. Go away.
Let's get started!
How long does the road take?
I'm good, thank you!
Don't be late for tomorrow's meeting.
That's the message.

That's her.
I can transport you.
Is Tom safe?
However, there is a solution.
You're unorganized.
I'm trying.
I'm sure Tom's gonna make it this way.
I don't think I've ever been so scared.
Can you do the job?
We need to get back to him.
You're uncultured.
Do you play sports?

A thousand years is a thousand years.
I'll put it on your account.
I'm planning to visit Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
Honest word.
We've got three guards working alternately.
We can't stay together, it wasn't written.
Visitors are welcome to visit.
Could you introduce yourself in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox.
Is Tom contributing?
This is a little embarrassing.
We were both busy.
I'm three hours away.
I like crosswords.
I expected them to be here.
Tom painted this.
Tom closed his mouth.
Don't you hate him?
Stop acting like a child.

It's on my head.
I shook my head.
Tom told me he was planning to go to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that’s a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'll go and finish.
I'm going to change.
Put down my earphone.
It may sound like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom that I want my money back today.
You'd be a great mother.
Tom continues to work.
Please find my head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom doesn't agree.
They rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, the movie will break.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but never, could not have happened here.

Here's your schedule today.
Tom's not waiting.
I want to eat pizza.

That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thanks in advance.
The question is what you're going to do.
Tom told Mary that he loved her.
Well, we're not in a hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom looked a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
He came back two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you're late, I'll be late for you.
You really should have let me call a cab.
I baked an apple pie.
The heat from the horse's thigh calmed him down.
Make your hands soft.

Linda was wearing modest dresses all the time.
You didn't smoke?
They let me go.

These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom connected with Mary.
Are you cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna have to ask Tom's permission.
Not everyone laughed at his joke.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is pointless.
They ate.
How many cups of coffee a day is too much?
Tom hates to run.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I danced with my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You would do the same in my place.
Now, let's continue the conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled at you.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
You're going?
I'm happy every day.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop fooling around.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man were you?
I should try to help them.
Can I get a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom earns three times as much as I do.
I cried one.
Write down your date of birth.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
I'll call him later.
They are as good as they are.
She looked excited.
A little time.
Tom said he and Mary won't be able to come to the party.
Just try to find him.
Tom stuck his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's a petty man.
Is the difference visible?
Come visit us tomorrow.
Tom visits Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did he ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do that.
Is this your bag?
The most important thing is to help her sleep.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.

That's not really necessary anymore.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was going.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom's sleeping tight.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom will go to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She wanted to be a nurse.
Tom has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is more powerful than hate.
You've got a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thanks for coming by.
I am as tall as he is.
Tom couldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So is Tom there?
Last night, she spent the night drinking in a meat bar.
I'm in.
Do you need rent?
The salt is gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to hold you back.
They're coming back.
You're really sweet.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
It's a no-brainer.
You wouldn't believe Mary at all.
I've never seen the rope.
I don't think they followed.
I feel like I'm free.
Just keep smiling.
I didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary escape from prison.
Tom doesn't have tea.
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.
But that’s not an argument!
Tom got a drink.

Leave him, Tom.
I've been through the shock.
It's a good system.
I don't remember Tom that high.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.

I'll tell my wife.
What if I don't invite Tom to my party?

I want you to find her.
The water glows in the sun.
A is a set consisting of members B, B and A.
Tom's free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
I'd be happy if the three of you came back out.
What's stopping you?
Tom has thin lips.
The kids are making bubbles.
Tom's violin practice for at least half an hour each day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's a lot of fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered with them.
Camoli Tom should have had more time for me.
I'm looking for him.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a shock.
You're burning your car.
She learned how to drive a car.

Let's not panic.
I have no willpower when it comes to exercise.
Let's go to Tom's.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room's a riot.
At your service.
I want to watch football on TV.
Still, I'd like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need a lot of food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom looked like he was a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my house.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more things I have, the more I need to clean up.
I found a solution!
I didn't see Tom.
Don’t forget to take a nap with sunscreen.
Was it hard for you?
Tom's voice was barely heard.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When's that gonna happen?
We're gonna have to reschedule.
His depression ended when he kissed her.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom's good with me.
No one will find us.
The room was chaos.
Music is only love in the search for words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom'll be waiting.
I'm starving you to death.
The real story is a little different from what I told you.
It was your fault.
The balloon was slowly coming down.
Who wants insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom began to laugh.
Is that why you came?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rings in the middle of the night, she immediately knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm completely naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn’t matter what you don’t want to do; you have to do it anyway.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
Still, we need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Merisol and Johnny are having pizza.
It's not a big miracle.
We need something that will take away our thoughts from our problems.
I called her yesterday.
Let me just focus.
She's selling sea schools.
Guard the prisoner.
We all like you.
The child was crying and crying for hours.
I'll go ask them.
Tom's not like his brother at all.
Tom was an idiot.
That was brilliant.
Please, tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you excited?
Tom couldn't have done it alone.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce you to Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
Maybe you'll be needed.
I have chest pain.
I can't tie the knot.
Give me my money back.
You have to show up first.
My father is a quiet man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional taper.
He stole my new wristwatch.
It doesn't look very different.
He's studying.
Tom made Mary's room on the bench.
We're throwing it away.
It's okay.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know if I'm happy or not.
Did you catch her?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his journey.
Your statement is top-down accurate.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.

It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.

Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I already packed up.
Since when do you feel the movements of the fetus?
I can't do that alone.
You better let me do that.
This house is better than the other one.
Tom must have done that.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm done.
Get married to me.
Tom is not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun and the night are shining.
No one is going to get fired.
There's no one else.
When I was traveling to New York from Boston, I met a fine girl on the bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom caught the fog.
They tied my eyes.
Do we really want to help them?
The person who pays the bills has the right to be mastered.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, get me some porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedies happen every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening.
Give me those sheets.
You can take mine.
Tom won't like it.
All comments are redundant.
Did you do this for me?
Can you call them for help?

I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.

It's noisy here.
What can we take?
I guess you found it.
Don't take it too literally.
Tom's pretty talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.
I'm going to point.
Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what's going on.
Whose house is this?
Tom would have failed without Mary's help.
Tom's cooperating.
The snow is one step deep.
She went with him to Boston.

I'm just glad I can help.

This will do the job for now.
They need to talk.
It didn't happen that way.
It's not like you were wrong.
Tom's listening right now.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
There is no life without weights.

I'm very attracted to you.
What's for dinner?
Open the 9th page.
Tom dug up his jacket.
Tom was beaten.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.

Put the gun down.
Here's your pudding.
Don't pee or I'll wash your mouth with soap.
If I were you, I would follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the desk.
You have to buy them a present.
I'm not entirely satisfied with Tom's explanation.
You seem right.
He ran away so they wouldn't catch him.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom's not back yet.
It has a sentimental value.
I asked her to play with me.

Aren't you panicking?
We need to do this again sometime.
I think Tom's sensitive.
He's an honest man.

We'll go back.
Is there anyone else?
Not all people are equal. That's still good news, because it means not all people are bad.
Isn't that exciting?
Tom came to ask for help.
It's easy for me to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.

That's really great.

Doesn't sound like anybody knows what.

Now what are you looking at?
We've signed up.
I was too tired to continue.
Everything has its own sound.
What the doctor thinks is wrong.
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't kidding.
It's written on his forehead.
Yesterday I got a call from a man named Tom Jackson.
Is it possible to use this page in the same way as Twitter?

It's always fun.
The noise was very calm.
I have to get back to them.
I don't want to go shopping today.
Tom's a punctuator.
Most of the clothing worn by Europeans is produced outside of Europe.
Tom's still busy.
Why do I have to fight?
We can search the internet.
When I was younger, I was always on a bus.
I couldn't figure out what the problem was.
Maybe Tom will talk.
It's so obvious we don't need proof.
I bought a pair of shoes.
How negative you are.

Where's our money?

We're ready to fight.
I advise you to listen to your doctor.

You're beautiful.
Wash yourself.
Tom refused to go.
Do you have a little time?
I want to know what you're taking to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I have something to eat?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I won't let you down.
Stay here and keep her.
Wouldn't you start to comb your hair from that?
How will you escape?
Let’s start with this wine.
My leg's broken.
How will you achieve that?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd be interested to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who's ever met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
That's what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these cuffs from my grandmother.
I have no problem with drinking.
I think I might get used to seeing you every day.
I wondered who it was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's the wrong thing.
It's in excellent condition.
I grabbed Tom for a lactation.
Mary likes fashion and make-up.

I think I'm wrong.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be right.

I'm late for spinach.
You know what happened?
Stop talking about me.

I was a fool to believe them.
Tom might need a little help.
I go to church every day.
Tom was a teacher.
I'd be broken.

Who gave them so much money?
We have to buy them a present.
When did the war end?
Did you work the gardening machine?
Tom's a married man.
Like Tom said, the soup is salted.
Did I miss you too much?
Why didn't she stop?
Will you come out?
They stopped to talk.
Did you bring a fan?
What Tom did was a mistake.
That's huge.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do what you want.
Can I use that?
We could talk about Tom.
What's this all about?
You're going to have to study harmfully next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There are algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
No one likes Tom.
Why are we stopping?
Oh, my God!
I should have asked them first.
Tom might be a little fat.
I'd rather die first than fulfill your request.
Maybe you should just let him go.
Where was he born?
Tom took two places.
I'll send you the recipe.
It'd look good.
I'll get the guns.
Choose what you like the most.

It's a great idea, but it'll take a lot of work.
You can’t focus on your academic work.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
They became dependent.
I just want money.
I don't say shit about their kids.
I want to know why you and Tom don't agree.
I've recovered completely.
I was the only one who knew where Tom went.
How badly did Tom get hurt?
Was he sympathetic?
The book he gave me is very interesting.
It's an honor.
Whenever something unusual happens, they blame me.

The ship changed course.
Tom was sent to a psychiatric hospital.
I feel insecure.
It's a safe place.
Tom didn't move his lips.
I'm an alcoholic.
Why is that crazy?

I have no intention of explaining anything.
April-li-li!
Tom said that.

Tom taught me.
How do you think Tom died?
I decided to stay where I am.
I think you're gonna have to work till the bush.
Open up, Sesame!
Tom looked outside.

I don't need a car.
Most people are right-handed.
To paint with or without a flash?

Give them a chance.

I think I'll be able to solve the problem myself.
They are too busy fighting each other to think of common ideals.
Can you give them a minute?

Did you touch something?
Let's do it now and it's over.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mother put your necklace in the top drawer.
You've experienced a traffic jam, but you'll be fine.
Think what you want.
Where can I find a hospital?

I'll go if Tom goes too.
We'll be back in a month.

The medicine worked.
Tom knows how to play the guitar.
Who broke it?
The line is short.
I've had enough of Tom.
I like you a lot.
I want to take you somewhere where I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, I didn't mean that!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I don't think it's fair that I bought this.
He saved the sailor.
Tom's obviously been here a long time ago.
Get up once more, you scoundrel!
How long ago was it?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd have avoided Tom for a while.
I won't wait to find out.

Does anyone listen to me?
How are you holding up?
Tom didn't know this.
I want to fuck her.
I can come tomorrow.
When did it happen?
I've fallen in love with you.
Tom's in his bedroom talking on the phone.
We had a hard time.
Sharpen your pencil.
I'm guilty.
The dog should be on the chain.
I'd much rather go alone.
It was one of them.
I want to go to bed and have a little rest.
Tom is in the hospital and recovering from what he overdosed on.
He broke the nut with his teeth.
I can't believe we cooked to shoot Tom.
Is it not possible for Tom to do this?
She didn't hit him, she hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They seem busy today.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I think I should look at Tom.
Just give it your all.

When you go to a meeting with a girl, you have to be self-confident.
Tom, please, this is neither the right time nor the right place.
We put her under surveillance.
Tom's insecure.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the cap on the glass.
That's a good training.

Are you still in bed?
It was for her.

I don't appreciate it.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I do not comment on the articles.
You'll be my guest.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
This is just a team.
I want to live in Brazil.
You're on your own.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Take care of Tom.
It's just words.
There was a short silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met last year in Boston.
Tom's too much of a bird.
No one walks in Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was in a hurry to catch the bus.
I didn't care.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was invincible.
I agree with the plans.
Justice is expressed through actions.
I don't know if you know it or not, but here in America you're expected to leave a kiss on the waiter.

Pray for her.
Will you wait a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at the banner on the square.
Didn't anyone tell you you didn't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I feel it in your touch.
He fell from the tree.
Tom told Maria that he had never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Tell me if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can hardly see it.
I'm coming.
I was in a half-soon.
Don’t expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the good things and the books.
This is a lot worse.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna freak out.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I've got something.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I stared at the man.
Take care of Tom.
They look familiar to me.
We've got work to do for them.
All my dreams will come true.
The river passes through the valley.
Get in touch with her.
Tom likes the best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There is no poison in fish.
I want you to be with me.
I want to play golf.
Tom is deeply interested in the history of art.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.

Did you sleep at least a little?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we'll have a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new to town and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in a closed room.
His concert was great.
There's no answer.

This is really easy.
Are you going on foot?
You should try it.
You're too busy worrying.
I don't think Tom's gonna help us much.
Tom seems worried.
I take care of him.
Tom's great.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
Tom's getting closer.
Tom seems shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom's compassionate.
Let's be brief, Tom.
Tom called to ask if there was anything he could do to help.
We could've gotten together.
This isn't anyone's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're late.
Tom ran to the vet.
Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer today than it was yesterday.
It must have been created from somewhere.
The weekend was fully equipped, with a pool, barbecue, a football field and a pool table.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young then.
I hear you've been wondering about me.
While he was eating his pizza, he bore his sister.
We should've given up earlier.
That's close enough.
Tom's polite.
Don't count on them.
And I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been insane.
"Why are you doing that?" "I can do it."
What a pig you are.
Lock the gate.
Tom lets the heat go.
We're all the same.
I want to be by your side.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
That was my mistake.
That sounds perfectly acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was sincere and confident and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not gonna yell.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I'm not gonna choke.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it in a butcher's shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would you believe them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two species in Ireland.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So, what should I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed and talking on the phone.
These are wonderful.
Tom's hands were tied.
Tom was thrilled.
I eat pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm an ass.
Where did Tom work?
I need pride to carry them.
The noise upsets the whole city.
A person who loves flowers cannot be a bad person.
This isn't fucking.
They're getting close.
You're evil.
Did you hand over Tom's note to him?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small trees.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you writing messages to Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom was banging.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She's always wearing offensive clothes.
Tom was the boss.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.
Women don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This isn't your problem. It's mine.
Before I went to bed, I took three cold pills.
Tom may not be right.
They may need help.
I don't have any vodka.
Tom behaves like a swamped desert.
It's a shame you broke up.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is forever.
First of all, you have no right to draw conclusions, and secondly, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems to be bored.
I'm raising cattle.
She's borrowing the line.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom's got a brick.
There was a war going on.
And did Tom participate?
The thief turned into a cop.
We're gonna let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and repulsive.
I wish I could help you more.
Tom is no longer seen.
I think we're ready.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the facade of the building, and when I passed by it by car, I didn't recognize it.
Is it only possible to have this?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the children were sitting on the floor.
Tom forgot.
Invite him to join us.
It won’t be easy to do this without a lot of help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works at a nearby restaurant.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
I gave him a sedative.
This has nothing to do with the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed to be deeply moved by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need a little help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult exam.
I'll get a divorce.
That dinner.
My weight's leaking.
They'll make you crackers.
Tom is a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser threw out a jet of hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting that we give Tom all the money, are you?
Tom continued to pack.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm here at my own will.
To protect you.
Someone's always been there for me.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He's very shy, he says he wants to see you.
Tom was right.
What color are they?
It can be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get any of them?
Can you get in touch with him?
Tom said if he wins the lottery, he'll buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I don't like math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to the elderly.
Precious stones include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz and ruby.
Go find them.
You have to ask your mother's permission first.
I'll take Tom's place.
What happened to you coming to Boston?
You are our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You're looking for the chickens.
It was a beautiful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for some time.
I'm in a hurry.
Tom remembered a variety of things that no one else could remember.
You can easily distinguish them.
I'll go look for her.
Of all the languages I’ve learned, my French was the easiest.
Tom wrote the home page.
I counted to 200.
Keep this.
Should I go?
It looks like a monkey.
The peppers are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't it be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did you want?
We have a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea specifically.
Can I get an esthetic?
They were all so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'm gonna lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed to Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I've got a housewife.
He was breathing deeply.
That's ugly.
I'm not good enough for her.
This woman is easily embarrassed.
Is there enough car in there?
I think I might be able to help her.
I'll do what's right for me.
Tom has plenty of time.
I'll be fine.
I found something strange.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
It's a beautiful alka.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was talking to Mary.
Was he home alone?
He made a lot of money out of it.
Can you help me solve that?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to return to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it yourself?
I'm gonna go find another one.
I'm hungry.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make spiders.
You really talk a lot.
It could be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
You don’t always have to believe what others are saying.
He's in love from head to toe.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter is not married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom's a pain shield.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're amazing!
It seems to me that this is the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what I'm going to do when I retire.
Tom recognized Mary's manuscript.
I think you've helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom knows how to do it.
Soon the sound will die.
Who's been flirting with you?
I don't really understand myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll come as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how to plant palm trees.
How do you know about him?
Just keep going.
Tom's a good friend of yours, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired that he slept without eating dinner.
How's Tom coming in?
There's someone on the threshold.
Tom wasn't leaving.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try to call her.
It was a great day.
It was a beautiful evening.
I think it's possible to sneeze.
It's free.
Peter might need a new diaper.
How's Tom at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom's not talking to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom wants to swim.
I'm gonna scream.
I'm not running away from you.
What's our situation?
Do you want me to hear it?
You're a real human hater.
Boston is a great place.
Who is responsible?
I'm serious.
I think it's better not to drink water.
No one's talking.
What did you have to do to contact them?
Nothing can be done.
Do you have anything?
It's not cool at all.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don’t want to be treated differently than before.
It should be all right.
I respected their rules.
Tom is a widower.
I think Tom's soulless.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
You've already done that.
You're poor.
Give me another check.
Many Russians were killed while painting themselves with their phones.
He thinks the old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We can see who is laughing, but not who is crying.
How old are you, Tom?
He was wearing red marmalade around his neck.
The girl said nothing.
It was getting dark.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He was bored listening to music.
Try the shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
Now I can barely work.
When did Tom say his party was gonna start?
This was obviously a tough decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
Dan did his job very well.
My legs are still hurting.
I'd do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
I may have fainted.
It's hard to judge his ability.
That's good.
I know a man sitting there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like that.
I'm open to everything.
I used to watch you.
Stay where you are.
Are you a traitor to her?
"She likes music, doesn't she?" "Yeah, she likes it."
Berber's whispering.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'll get lost.
Her sister was given an injection against the flu.
Did you try to talk to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom didn't stay here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started to chase Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why do I never win?
Tom fell off the scale while cleaning his shells.
Do you have anything to add, Tom?
Shut up, fool!
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Damascus is located in Syria.
All the songs were good except yours.
I don't think Tom's going to be at school tomorrow.
Please, go ahead.
We'll wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
Next year, my birthday will fall on Sunday.
They all laughed.
Did Tom look happy?
Who wrote the messages?
Tom's making glazes.
Tom was breathing deeply.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to a cave?
Dan didn't want to go to the orphanage again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel like you need someone.
You'll never know.
I'm still thinking about him.
I thought it was causing me.
Tom looks lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one came.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it if you don't show him.
You bought something for Mary.
There is nothing more like a fool than a drunk.
Take Tom.
Tom's getting dressed.
I know Tom does it again.
It looks good.
We stayed in Boston.
This almost works.
I can't concentrate with all these gals.
Share the cards, Tom.
The robbers tied his mouth.
Laugh at him.
This medicine will relieve the pain.
I'd like to honor you tonight.
Can't he wait for that?
They'll pay for their superiority.
Dan hasn't missed an episode of that soap opera.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the documents.
We have a few questions for you, Tom.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I hate her as much as you do.
We can get you some help.
I heard him.
We're looking at the whole area.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
Tom told me that I'd like to come to visit him tomorrow afternoon.
Everyone will thank me.
Here we are.
Why do they do that?
I studied college for four years and didn't get anything but a poor diploma.
This is priceless.
Do you want to draw?
It was pretty disgusting.
Tom's listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're back together.
After the fire, there was only ashes left.
Tom likes all vegetables except for the cabbage.
Try to put yourself in his shoes.
Tom used to write poetry.
We'll take Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm ready to make up for it.
People can't work miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to exclude him from their society.
Those who confuse the verb endings "-tsya" and "-se" are waiting for a special place in hell.
What happened next?
You know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like they're everywhere.
I didn't count on it.
I was desperate.
I just saw Tom last week.
This shouldn't take too long.
I'm trying not to break up.
Tom's got to clean up.
We're very angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everyone knows how to drive.
Tom jammed two pipes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom didn't leave a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences for a whole month.
That was awful.
We're glad you're here.
You've earned something.
It's really bad.
You want some cheese?
They say that blue palligans contain a lot of nicotine.
Looks like I'm feeling a little tired.
She gave him all her money.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't like surprises.
My wife is all-wise and devout.
I'll transfer him to Tom.
I don't think I'll be able to pass the test.
I think we'll join too.
Tom leaned forward.
Tom's keeping his car well.
You're interesting.
This time I can win.
All the people of the earth were created by a common ancestor.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm not.
I'm having fun.
We all have to go find Tom.
I'm fine.
You need help with this?
Tom, your patent is open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom's not going to the market.
I came to bring him a present.
I asked her to describe it.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What's that?
Can people really be so brilliant to think that the entire population of Georgia, which speaks Caucasian language that has no common phonemes or letters in common with English, can fully master English in just two years?
I'm just guessing.
Tom doesn't like milk.
Our attempts were futile.
There are too many things I don't know.
He had respiratory problems.
Tom's good at tennis.
Berlin is very cold.
I'm crazy.
Tom was laughing at him.
Do you miss Boston?
I think you should call him.
Every student has their own closet.
Tom's not my type.
These are for them.
Do you really have to work weekends?
What's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I got something for him.
How do I know if Tom is right for me?
Tom's studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that beautiful sound?
This isn't Tom's first delay.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students are gone.
You've done so much.
Kate's very charming.
Where'd you go?
Your way is hard.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom picked up his flash drive and started playing.
Tom wants to be rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
In the middle of a mess.
The blood flows through the blood vessels.
You borrow books.
I can barely move.
Tom was wondering how good a singer Mary was.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not musical, but I sing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing volleyball.
When did you buy it from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
What didn't help us?
I really want to learn French.
We all have to die.
You hate her, don't you?
Dan learned the lesson the hard way.
I showed them the fakes of my friends.
I give my employees the right to leave early.
Are you here alone?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
The cat is on the roof.
What's in that closet?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too low.
I'm sorry.
What books do you need?
Tom asked me if I liked Boston or not.
I don't like big dogs.
I'm thirsty.
He ate the salad from the keel.
I'm going to run.
Tom's a little chewy.
I want to buy you a present.
It's stuck.
Tom had never been to Boston.
It's good to be independent.
Tom's pretty popular.
I have a big family.
No one can help me now.
I'm glad he's back.
I'll bring the ice.
Come and look.
Do you think you're cute?
Innocence is often a blessing, not a virtue.
Tom's pulse is speeding up.
There's a restaurant here nearby, but it's not very good.
That mistake is very common.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
She was constantly smirking about how kind, compassionate, brave, and yet I don’t know what.
Did you lie to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
Tom believes in Mary.
Busy five.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks to the victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom's watching TV.
I don't know why I always have to be me.
They stopped going.
That's not a mistake.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I was born in 1980.
Tom loves his life.
The shape of the skull is different in different people.
I've become uncomfortable with heteronormative propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't stand it for long.
Give yourself a reward on your own.
It all makes sense.
I'll open the door for you.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked you how you were.
I don't know how to behave here.
We need to advertise on TV.
Tom nodded inaudibly.
They won't help you.
I feel great.
They're not there.
There's nothing wrong with me.
They have a good appetite in the morning.
The old man made a hole in the wall.
Tom hated us.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You have to be happy for them.
This candle is very heavy.
Tom stopped crying.
All these things are waiting for me.
Is it really a diamond?
You know I don't eat meat.
He seems very sleepy.
Yesterday I made a cake with mushrooms.
I hope he succeeds.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Tom won't be home for lunch.
Is there a prize?
Believe in the science!
Although the rainworm has both a male and female reproductive system, it needs another individual to fertilize.
Failure is a disgrace to Lisa.
I heard Tom got sick.
Tom's unconscious.
Don't smoke in here.
Does Tom have a key?
I'm moving on right now.
Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
The temperature of the sun's surface is estimated to be about 6,000 degrees Celsius.
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
The mob's gone.
Tom's starting to work.
Tom wanted Mary to buy John's birthday present.
Cover it.
The police are looking for them.
How deep is the hole?
The bread is fresh out of the oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'll get Tom to check it out.
That was the shame.
I need Tom's address.
That's kind of sad.
I just didn't trust her.
Tom could have gone.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did you want to eat Tom?
I got Tom's keys.
Tom was rejected.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen.
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
You know a lot about us?
Someone killed Tom.
Tom wasn't impressed.
That was pretty bad.
This must be yours.
Taman's on time.
I kind of felt sorry for you.
Cigarettes are for adults.
Tom and Mary left fingerprints on their hands in the liquid cement.
The Cavalier would never do such a thing.
I love them.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was incomprehensible.
This is great.
Tom, don't make me Tosho.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I would say no.
No one deserves to die.
I didn't know what that meant then.
Tom has never lost his hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
In what situations would you do that?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the gold coins.
Fortunately, the gap is stable, otherwise the storm would have otherwise collapsed last night.
I heard they caught her.
Tom's got it written somewhere.
There is no good news.
And who do you work for these days?
I'll quit.
Mary’s eyes were filled with joy.
It's bad to be a bird.
I only have one minute.
Tom never gives up.
I think Tom's a conservative.
How are you guys?
I'd like a piece of pie.
I'm sick of your constant complaints.
Don't you care what's going to happen to Tom?
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's getting mysterious.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too soon.
You scared her.
Tom cheated on us.
What was I talking about?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The seller is cheating.
It's all in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.
I paid a penalty.
I want to know who that phone call was from.
Was he home at 10?
It's closed today.
Please let Tom know.
I'll make her help you.
I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.
I was thinking about you.
Where could Tom be?
Tom's on his way to Boston.
I have plans for dinner with Tom.
She made me tea.
It's just a job.
I hear there's a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and came to turn to her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
You want to go to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I am looking forward to seeing the new version of Tatoeba.
It looks aimless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why don't you sing?
Did you really do that, Tom?
Damn, I didn't know how to play basketball.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was a great pleasure to be asked to speak.
Tom's not a sportsman.
I'm stunned, Tom.
I don't see anything.
Make your horses public.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt very alone.
I really want to try new things.
Tom wasn't the only survivor of the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom doesn't laugh.
I started seeing him.
We'll hurry.
You haven't eaten yet?
Tom found me a cab.
He did a miracle.
The glands secrete chemical substances in the body.
That wasn't my idea.
Tom's resting.
Don't run around.
You better not talk like that.
This is a new model.
I've been helping her.
The music unites.
This is just a simulation.
I'm glad to see you, Tom.
I kind of felt sorry for her.
He's too generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bicycle.
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Come here!
You could've refused.
Why don't you let me help?
It'll happen soon.
Hey, it's creepy here, get me out of here before I choke.
It'll happen what happens.
I heard that story.
It's still dark outside.
That's what Tom wanted to say.
Is Tom there alone?
I'll find her.
The police found nothing to link Dan to the robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers came from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Julia.
We have to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom treated himself well.
Looks like I'm gonna have to wait a little longer.
You can go and stay the way you want.
This is your wine.
I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you speak up?
Where will the meeting be?
Let’s play “Truth or Challenge.”
His conclusions are based on unproven assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom began to unravel the book.
That's the real reason.
Tom loves flowers a lot.
Tom told Mary to be careful.
I fainted.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very kind.
You know who I am?
Why don't you listen?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a siren song to me.
I don't want you to put yourself in danger.
I'm fat.
How much time do you spend in front of a computer?
My wife is getting sick of her daily routine.
I want to know how you did that.
Amebs are single-celled organisms.
Tom said he needed someone's help here.
How long have you been in Boston?
Tom shook my hand.
You're crazy!
How late is the train?
Let's park there.
That's very stupid.
It was hot yesterday, but today it's more durable.
I'm fine.
He walked in front of me.
Give it back to me.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston last night.
This is not fair to me.
Someone might have followed them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
It's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a safe.
I almost met her.
They were smiling.
I'd like to hear from him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
You want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like more bread?
This won't work.
He just left.
The kids were so excited after the party that they couldn’t sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel very guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You beat me.
Do you think we'll get to the station in time?
Everything seemed fine.
The mother was cruel to her adoptive father.
An international language would be of great use to mankind.
I've been helping them.
Have you made up your mind yet?
Dan asked Linda to sleep with him.
Tom didn't lie to me at all.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
You can't leave a baby alone.
Tom has mental problems.
Tom began to eat.
She's kind.
What time is it?
Have a nice weekend.
Do you want some water?
Tom snuck at the girls.
We had a terrible fight.
Tom seems to be different today.
Get them off the deck.
Japan as a country has many different characteristics.
It's disturbing.
It was an offer I couldn’t refuse.
The monks used to play tennis at the monasteries.
Don't be so perverted!
Tom wants proof.
We didn't come here for them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your paycheck.
Sorry, I called the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom's got little hands.
I'm worried.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The exam included mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
Tom washes the money.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
So didn't you say you know how to swim?
He's not pressuring Tom.
They betrayed me.
And he's taking the paper.
Tom doesn't know how to express himself.
Attend the meeting.
I'm gonna find a picture of you holding a speech.
This sentence has five words.
He ate lamb cr<0xC3><0xA8>me, potatoes, and mushroom soup for dinner.
We were waiting for them outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier like this.
Tom lied to you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom is doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not an option at all.
How old were you when your parents got divorced?
The French are heavy.
I very rarely ask questions.
You're a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor examines the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.
Smoke is in the air.
The printer is not working.
I'll send you to the door.
It's dark here.
Tom's a predator.
This was too much for her.
Tom wondered what would happen if he pressed the blue button.
If you see Tom, could you give him this?
We can order pizza.
Tom's a lot better.
I just want to talk to Tom.
The prince's fine.
We're drinking water.
Maybe we should stop.
Mary represented her team in the match.
Tom doesn't want a party.
It looks like an egg.
I just want to visit Tom.
I'm a unit.
We don't want new accidents.
There's no way it was Tom.
I'll kill you.
Most people have great resistance to getting up early, even when necessary.
Give me the gloves.
I watched Tom.
Who's there with you?
What are you so excited about?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom's gone mad.
It wasn't very good.
Mechanics should be understood in oils and motor lubricants.
How was yesterday?
You have to study harmfully.
We can't let them go.
They have families.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's have breakfast.
I'm salting my omelet.
Tom explained Mary's rules in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
They got them, didn't they?
I totally forgot about him.
The interesting question remains unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I pulled out my knife.
They were dancing.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I'm lying down at ten and a half.
I don't know where she went.
A boy ran to me.
Tom looks very tired now.
I'll follow your instructions.
I put it together.
Tom stayed calm.
You said you'd help.
Cells are the basic constituent units of living things.
They're entertaining her.
I have to go get dressed.
How long do you work as a doctor here?
Tom wrote this book.
Chukunbaba died one day after the birth of my older sister.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have much appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom quickly lost himself in the crowd.
As far as you know, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still a butcher.
This is hard for me.
How do you feel about her now?
Don't surprise me.
That surprised me.
This is what we discussed a few days ago.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn to the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you miss me when we kiss?
Someone's gonna see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I misjudged it.
It'll be over in a little while.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom's talking.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He knows how to play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't even offer a philanthropist coffee to Mary.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the seed.
It's not too early.
Can I eat?
They were painted inside the yellow windows.
Tom, are you in here?
You can use this car.
I'm glad to hear that.
It's like I'm dancing.
We have to wait here.
Is everything all right with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
No one is talking about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages? No.
You and I will fly the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
An hour before the event.
You were amazing.
I won't give up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird raises the frog with its beak and flies to its nest.
Tom wanted to go.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom wasn't the same man three years ago.
They all smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom's unusually calm.
I'll ask Tom to take the time for you tomorrow afternoon.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom was trying to free himself.
What am I gonna be to them?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not the right time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would take.
Tom runs next to Mary.
A cat scratched me.
Tom's not an old lady.
The question is how Tom did it.
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best.
Now I can't ask them.
Tom's got wave hair.
Long live the USSR!
It's very subtle.
I want to buy pineapple.
I was home yesterday.
That's my only hope.
Don't come for me.
The simple question is DE.
The bush is burning.
Tom was affected.
I'm biting my conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He has three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom was drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little bit deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're getting a lot of sniffing.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's doing something.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his face.
Don't you believe us?
I respect you.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
They're mine.
Was the trip nice?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They are hunting dogs.
You need to create a habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom's got his heart.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom's out.
This is the king's most trusted advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go get dressed.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that from?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one will be hurt.
Tom gave Mary a watch.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He's changing jobs.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom continued to climb.
Tom might be able to light your car.
Did you hear that, too?
What did they find?
He was lying in my eyes.
I'll go find her.
I wanted to wash up.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware Tom had done that.
If I ignore him, he's gone.
They'd just block Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I taught him na<0xC3><0xAF>ve.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach and spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on strike.
He's a little sloppy, so speak up.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
They're for you now.
That's a very dry explanation.
The walk before breakfast is refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It is too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
Wasn't that terrible?
Tom tried to kill himself last night.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We all want to see the movie.
It's simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom wore the shirt all the same.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
The dinner was really good!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and division is not.
I'm getting dressed.
Tom took off his hat and gave himself a present.
He's taking away our oil.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
Whose manuscript is this?
Did you see what he wrote in today’s newspapers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six coffees a day.
Tom was screaming.
It was Better.
Tom started talking.
I'll ask you to stay a while longer.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
They all pointed at her.
Maybe Tom's gonna die by Sabayle.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be on time.
Tom was out of his mind.
Limenkava is empty.
There's a fever in the refrigerator.
Why are you asking me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom relaxed his hand.
Einstein thought of himself as a philosopher.
My partner's got my glasses on.
So it wasn't.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We've all screwed up about her.
Didn't you see the avalanche flag?
You're welcome.
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I think I found one like that.
You'll try, won't you?
Tom's been without food all week.
I don't understand you.
Although I am a devout man, I am still a man.
Tom apologizes for being late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't be so angry.
A lot of people are hunting.
He deserves the award.
Can we talk?
Where did we go?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We need to examine something.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't come out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are you doing?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started to say something, but Mary nodded.
We met in Maine.
How was Tom?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town around looking for a home.
Let him go.
Night life is better in New York City.
Please come in.
The drug must be drunk on an empty stomach.
Tom's not a member.
It seems our job is not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
It's my fault.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
You baked centuries of bread.
Pigs from marzipan do not starve.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom was furious with Mary.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom is for it.
Tom might be here today.
There is no difference between reality and fantasy.
Tom is a hero.
Tom has no willpower.
Can you help me?
Don't let me down.
Tom wasn't home when I came back.
I still don't get it.
I've heard it from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's do it again.
It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I've been home all night.
We left at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
He used to love Boston.
We don't have that much money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found someone to talk to, you only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human because it is of a different dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don’t think they have a cure for it yet.
Each member must be present.
She didn't understand the joke.
This is the worst snow I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom's obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you understand what his name is?
It doesn't seem to help.
You have to let me pass on a message to Tom.
Where's my golf equipment bag?
Please read these instructions.
We're not traitors.
The flour is made from wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom did not agree with Mary on the subject.
You're right.
I'll go.
Today is my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar to me.
I'll eat it.
Then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy the presents?
You two are very sweet together.
You're so pretty.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What is happiness?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You cut your key bone while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blind.
Do you really think this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was stabbed.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I had anything to cook.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom scream.
It tastes like tea.
I wouldn't be wasting my nerves for that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
It's time for closure.
Leave me alone.
The stone ran down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom's crazy, by the way.
Come on!
It doesn't hurt his heart.
No need to comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
At that time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin's very sweet.
You're such a scoundrel.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was all right here.
They look squishy.
I could make it easier for you.
Put the phone down.
You'd never leave the house for a nap.
I think Tom's a snitch.
Illnesses from a terrible infection and the ovary and leaking.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't work.
It doesn't come in handy.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He sometimes behaves strangely.
We'll hang them.
It’s probably not the right time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was very stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incapacitated.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I got a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a drip cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the smartest.
I had to protect Tom.
This is just relaxing.
Call him right away.
Stick to the topic.
She really wants to talk.
I have a ton of questions.
This is an interesting, funny, and even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language looks at the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put on your pajamas.
Nawka.
This is the Holy Land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday is in July.
We've got it all.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he doesn't know how to play tennis.
Where did you find her, live?
This was at the top of the pile.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's an ungodly man.
Tom hasn't talked to me since we broke up.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found another one.
I don't know if I should sit or run.
Don't you think it's hot enough for December?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you shaking yourself in it?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'll call her.
I lost a sense of time.
The island is an American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I'll bake a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are in the room?
I've been thinking about it.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You've got your butt kicked.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little confused.
