Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid of not being taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently appalled by a proposal to change the name from assembly member or AM (member of the Assembly) to member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A Labour member said his group is concerned about your "MWP rhymes on Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means foolish and "pwp" buzz.
A member of the Plaid party said the group "is not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said his group has an "open mind" regarding the name change, but added that MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced not unlike the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's delegation, who is now writing legislation to introduce the name change, said, "The final decision on which members of the National Assembly should be named will of course be up to the members themselves."
A 2017 Welsh official decision gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the name proposals that demonstrated great support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the National Assembly members, the delegation prefers Welsh MP or WMP, while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
The National Assembly members have reportedly made other proposals, but the struggle to agree has given the head of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main work. She will submit the bill in a few weeks.
The legislation of the reforms contains other changes to how the delegation should function as well, including rules on disqualification of assembly members and the design of a committee system.
Assembly members will be able to vote on what to name when debating the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote over whether to change the name of their country to "North Macedonia" on Sunday.
The popular uprising was determined to resolve a conflict that has preceded for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a claim on the territory and has had many objections against Macedonia's membership applications to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he will look away from the result.
Those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin are silent while the churches of Harlem, New York, are struggling
"The old ones I've talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," Adams said.
"Today there are none of the parts."
He said he understood why the bars were disappearing.
"People are socializing in other ways now and then," he said.
"Bars are no longer living in the neighborhood that people visit normally."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling the properties will not last as long as the leaders believe, "and sooner or later they are back where they started."
He added that churches can be replaced by parishes filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historic sites in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of those who buy condominiums in these buildings are white," he said. "and this is how the day comes when all the churches are closed, because it is not likely that these people who move into condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built of white socks before Harlem became a black town - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black sock that had been preaching nearby, moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black sock led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the shops at 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem where the owners were opposed to adding or promoting blacks.
The building suffered major damage in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a new clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and successor in Saint Martin, was proud and called the clock game "the clocks of the poor."
The expert who played at the July clock game called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "a historical instrument that cannot be replaced."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first time in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who left the church to play the larger time game in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has become a complicated story of architects and building workers, some of them added by the leaders of the lay people of the church, and others of the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, which heads the parish and consists of the leaders of the lay people, wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would ask the sacristy to pay," although the sacristy was not involved in the diocese's hiring of architects and construction workers.
Some of the members of the parish have complained of the lack of openness from the diocese.
13-year-old injured by shark during hummingbird dive in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack on her just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help. He paddled away to the boy with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought only the boy was excited to have caught a hummer, before realizing that the boy shouted "about bite me!
Something's inside me!"
"His whole collarbone was torn off," Hammel said he observed when he reached the boy.
"I screamed that everyone had to get out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was picked up by an air ambulance and taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It is unknown what kind of shark it was that attacked the boy.
Bath guard Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy suffered serious injuries to the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most are not believed to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's store chain bets on beauty products
The British store chain Sainsbury's is to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' beauty products and offer supermarket services in the store.
As part of an investment in Britain's beauty market, worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continuing to grow as fashion and interior sales go down, Sainsbury's is to test out their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and several stores if it becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with TVs, microwaves, and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they will double the number of beauty products to 3000 products and offer the brands Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They are to give the brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand as in the Boots stores.
The store will also relaunch its own makeup series Boutique and make most of the products vegan, which will attract more young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the sale of its perfumes in two of Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Acting online and a shift towards buying small amounts of food every day from local small shops, means that large store chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, has commented that the stores will look more and more like a department store, while the store chains try to fight the low-price stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has teamed up with the interior chain Argos in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, since they bought up both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims this has increased the food sales and thus defended the acquisition.
The store chain's previous attempt to renew the beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaborated with the Boots in the early 2000s, but this came to an end when the parties did not agree on how to share the profits from pharmacies in stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy chain Celesio, which had 281 pharmacies and owned the pharmacy chain Lloyds, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and is to offer an extended luxury series of skin products, including the La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how the beauty shelves will look and be experienced to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also added colleagues with special expertise who will be able to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and the practical locations mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of acting."
Peter Jones "raised" after Holly Willoghby withdraws from deal worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
The star of the TV show Dragons The, Peter Jones, is "racing" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an agreement with his lifestyle label worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to promote their interior and accessories brand Truly.
The pair's collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of the program This Morning, 37, made the news known on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, amid the development of their new collaboration on a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "crazy" when the golden Holly confessed during a strenuous meeting on Tuesday in Jones' headquarters business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - mean she no longer has time to cooperate on the Truly-to-Interior.
The partnership has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was believed to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make it known that she should not be working with Truly, while Jones fled the UK to settle in one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Trily was absolutely on top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future, and would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one believed their own islands on Tuesday, Truly was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the decision of the This Morning host, which is one of the richest stars in the UK, can cost the company millions due to heavy investment in products, from pillows to candles to clothes and interiors, and can cause delays with the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the Truly brand along with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples vacation together and Jones own 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin who will host ITV's program I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night "We don't comment on his business."
Tough conversations "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would get from the media to make a comment some might experience as "unpresidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said with his tullestem as a "newsreader".
"I haven't given up anything."
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the disarmament of the nuclear weapons program in North Korea.
But negotiations on the nuclear weapons program have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the UN's general assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a "corresponding response" from the United States regarding North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he added, the United States continued with sanctions to push North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“It’s going great between us and North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results - the end of rocket testing, aid to the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
He defended his unusual approach in terms of relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing to the group standing in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organizations were told that there was no need for them.
Although more than 10 percent of the residents of Lombok had to flee, no one declared a national state of emergency, which is necessary for international emergency aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they don't want international help, so it's a bit challenging," said Sumbang.
While Redd Barna is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain whether foreign passport holders are allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesman for Indonesia's National Crisis Agency, said authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are allowed to offer emergency assistance.
Although Indonesia is prone to earthquakes often, the country is not particularly prepared for the natural forces.
In the Aceh area, they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings of tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, most likely leading to more casualties.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat those injured in the earthquake is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration of President Joko, and next year there will be elections again.
President Joko is also being pressured when it comes to sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative belief.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets and used machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday in Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal while the position was 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left before kicking him up and towards the goal.
The attempt sailed high above the penalty field and faux towards the right upper corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball fell over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the goal.
"I was just trying to get into that position to take the ball, and I knew that players like Shaq were trying to get as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and lose the ball once without thinking about it, and then I shot the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 after the break after scoring in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Prior to the goal, Hazard gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic before he spun off near midfield and into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly took the ball on the midfield.
Then he beautifully skated it and led Hazard into the penalty field.
Hazard ran faster than Liverpool's defense and scored with his left foot right past goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of victims in Indonesia-Tsunami rises to 832
The number of victims in the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, the country's emergency agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake, such as her on Friday and had a magnitude of 7.5 followed by 6 metres high waves, the spokesman for the crisis agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, reported in a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is now covered with collapsed buildings.
British police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A homicide investigation has started after a woman was found murdered in Birkenhead, Merseyside today early.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 07:55 in Grayson Mews in John Street, while a 32-year-old man is arrested, suspected of murder.
Police have asked for tips on the incident from local residents.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is still in an early phase, but I'm asking anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious about contacting us.
I also encourage everyone, including taxi drivers, who can catch him something on the dashboard camera, to contact us in case they have important information."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who was found is from Birkenhead, and that she was found in a home.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the area to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continued and police have stated that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to get into his own apartment but has been told by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He didn't know what to say when he found out what had happened.
The residents have been told that they are not allowed to enter their apartments in many hours.
Someone overheard a police officer say to a man that the whole area is a place.
A woman came to the scene crying.
She says over and over again "it's so awful".
At 2 p.m. two police cars could be seen inside the police band and another police car outside the band.
A crowd of police officers stood within the police band and observed a block of apartments.
If someone has information, they can send DM to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling +44 (0) 800 555 111 with the reference "log 247 from 30 September".
Parliament statue of Cromwell becomes last victim of "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious artifacts in England as his Puritan followers did during the 17th century Civil War.
However, the Cromwell Association described Crick's proposal to remove the statue as "clothes" and "an attempt to write about history."
John Goldsmith, the chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was not ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century public opinion, and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still think it is worth celebrating."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 19th century, and is still today, regarded as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was, of course, against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not is still a topic of discussion in historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual whom we know represented one side of that separation.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Murder Gris Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, by the surname Yuan, was found dead, with cut pulse wounds and covered with blood, near a pig binge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to give pigs vaccines on a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, he found his cousin dead, and discovered that the door to one of the pig bins was open.
He said that in the binge there was a large jug of blood around the mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kg heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and destroyed," said the cousin, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras show that Yuan came to the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked inside to prevent him from attacking others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Although it is rare, such attacks from pigs have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, causing the man serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg heavy pig held a Welsh farmer trapped between him and a tractor, until his wife scared the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon became eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to normal, but that the taste of blood can trigger the animals.
"They just want to play.
They like to bite a little, they're curious ... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa bring rain to southwestern United States
As predicted in the weather report, Hurricane Rosa weakens over the cool waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring peach rain to northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rosa had wind strength up to 136 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane until 05:00 in the eastern United States time zone on Sunday, and the hurricane center was 620 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is due to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure over the Pacific Ocean is forming that moves east to the west coast of the United States. Rosa is approaching the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity northward to the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause heavy rain in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous floods and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will lead to rain of between 5 and 7 centimetres per hour in some parts of the southwestern United States, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimetres of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States; especially over much of Arizona.
Dangerous floods can occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
It was warned of hiking in the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can turn into gusty rivers and lightning and estor storms will bring strong winds and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total rainfall of over 1 centimeter is possible, which can create small floods and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain bye for the season in the region.
Widespread tropical rain cities will start in Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, before rain rises late on Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic is getting colder, but tropical regions will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost a 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The next few days, late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start in October, with 25 degrees and upwards from the southern part of the large plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term forecast indicates that there are high chances of above average temperatures in the eastern United States through the first half of October.
More than 20 million look at Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the U.S. Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different TV channels.
At the same time, the political discussion around the case continued, with interruptions in the regular television programs by various broadcasting companies to reveal the latest news on Friday: a unit reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the charges over the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court Committee that she is 100% sure that Kavanaugh felt her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during an emotional hearing, that he is 100 percent sure it is not her.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the hearing on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company reached this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.
The numbers were not clear from other channels showing the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers watching from the office.
To put this into perspective, there are a similar number of viewers looking at an American football final or the Oscars award.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with the most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested after the hearing.
Flake was in the spotlight during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, who is a moderate Republican, declared that he is on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while protesters shouted after him on his way to a hearing with a jury on Friday.
He stood and watched the ground for several minutes while the Protestants chanted at him on CNN live.
"I'm standing here right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you believe he is telling the truth to our country?"
Some said to him, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office has spoken out, and before entering the elevator he said he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
The broadcasting agency showed the hearing on TV when the judging committee was to vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to the full Senate and further voting.
But Flake said he could only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against Kavanaugh over the next week, which the Democrats have also requested.
Flake was partially overwhelmed after talking to his friend, Democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After speaking with Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision proved to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May blames critics for "playing politics" when it comes to Brexit
Britain's Prime Minister, Theresa May, blames critics of her plans to leave the EU to "play politics" with Britain's future regardless of national interests, in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Party's conference on September 29, 2018.
Alongside the interview with May on the front page of the Sunday Times, there is an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, where he goes to tackle the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and says that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's fees is "totally absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting in United States: Police arrest the suspected Dyteon Simpson for Sims shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and jailed for intentional murder, police say in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost their glasses during the battle.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report from the WAFB channel, which is linked to CBS.
After hearing Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
Simpson's bail was set at $350,000, reports the local newspaper The Advocate.
The coroner of the east-Baton Rouge published an early autopsy report on Friday showing that the cause of death was a shot in the head that went into the neck.
The Baton Rouge police thank Louisiana state police's special forces, state police's crime lab, police at Southern University and local residents to help them find Simpson.
The athletic director of LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being "warned in the pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 metre high basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 setbacks per game prior to the season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "credible" after Wayde was killed.
"Then there's something we're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano erupts ash over Mexico City
Ossetians from the volcano Popocatepetl have reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Crisis Prevention asks Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after activity increased in the crater and the center recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumbles and quakes.
Images on social media show thin layers of ashes on cars in various neighborhoods of Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six protesters were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for self-inflicted noise along with police forces, and thousands of other protesters protested against self-inflicted one year after the rumour of possible release from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powder varnishes that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
The compound also broke out later in the day, and police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours, the separatists shouted "Don't forget, don't forgive" while the Protestants against independence shouted, "Long live Spain."
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries after the protests.
The mood is still pressured in the region and many will still have independence one year after the October 1 vote, which was called illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most voters voted for independence, but there was also low voter turnout among those against independence and boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the noise and electoral clashes occurred in the region.
Groups who were too independent slept in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
However, the demonstration went off the stack, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer has hope of independence in Catalonia.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy in order to be able to vote for independence, but now we're stuck again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections before December, the Catalan parties are striving for independence to hold on to power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent self-determination.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was plagued by police officers on both sides.
"The tension is increasing more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been part of ongoing trials since last year, declared that he will run for election to the European Parliament next year.
"To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.
Londonderry, Northern Ireland: Men arrested for deliberately crashing car into house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after crashing into a house intentionally several times in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the car sustained damage to the entrance gate and the building itself.
A armrest may have been used to shoot at the car.
Menga shot gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensures says
Ascended Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiences his second say after 18 games as coach for the Ibrox club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's side leveled with Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side has no away goals in the Scottish Premiership League this season, and is scheduled to play against Hearts, as they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has six consecutive wins, and head coach Holt has still not lost since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against away team
Holt's team was to have hired long before they scored, creating more problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson broke through but had low efforts towards the goal, causing Alan Lithgow to have to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could create trouble for the away team.
And that was how the decisive goal became scored.
Rangers agreed on a free kick and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and scored from the middle of the penalty field.
Before that, Rangers dominated the ball but saw that the home defense was solid and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a goal.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow batted long after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passages were sent back and forth in the Livingston penalty field, while two penalties - after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one by hand - were waived.
'Fenomenalt' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal match and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played fantastically and still impresses on the curve upwards.
Their playing and playing style has hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks for it goes to Holt for the way he has shocked the team since he became a coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, organizing a defense at the military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the game.
Rangers, on the contrary, were not motivated.
Still as good as they've been under Gerrard, they weren't good enough this time though.
They didn't play well enough, and only cut up the home half once, which should make the Rangers realize they don't reach up anymore.
Erdogan gets mixed welcome in Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under the blue sky when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday, September 29 in Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is hoped to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
Countries have been at odds in terms of human rights, press freedom and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of over 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque due to "security reasons," but many of Erdogan's supporters met to see his president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of the Kurds - also met to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German state's decision to welcome him in the country.
The dueling Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who view Erdogan as a hero, and others, who view him as an autocrat.
Car accident in Deptford, London: Cyclist killed after car crash
A cyclist has lost his life in a collision with a London car.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east London, at 10:15 local time.
The driver stopped and ambulance personnel quickly arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred just a few months after another cyclist died when the driver ran off in Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from today's accident.
London police reported that they are in the process of identifying the man and informing his family.
Roads have been closed and buses must run around the area, while other motorists have been encouraged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison in England: Six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a high-security men's prison, says the prison office in England.
The ongoing disorder broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday.
Special "Tornado" forces have been gathered to calm down the rebellion, involving eight prisoners in a separate part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor damage to the respiratory system.
A prison spokesman said, "Special-trained guards are to calm down the ongoing rebellion in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to sit in jail any longer."
It seats more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the UK.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated for injuries, after a prisoner went on strike.
And in October last year, special forces had to come to the prison to calm down a serious riot, where prisoners threw billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flood (in favor of drying area)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it is just such a weather phenomenon that is heading towards Arizona early next week, in the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pulls southwest across the desert and creates fears of flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued warnings of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, and may already rain late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low-pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 miles within the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center report between 5 and 10 centimetres of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It can count between 2 and 5 centimetres in other areas of the southwest drought, including central parts of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with isolated total amounts up to 10 centimetres.
For areas outside of flood risk, the rain from Rosa may be a blessing in the drought.
Although flammable is a serious concern, this calculated will likely benefit areas in the southwestern United States that are prone to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, there is extreme drought in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest drought category, weather.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rosa comes to move across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With winds of over 135 kilometers per hour on Sunday morning, Rosa is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm encounters colder water in the Pacific and therefore calms down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm force, Monday afternoon or evening.
It is going to rain a lot in parts of Mexico, which can increase the risk of flatulence.
"Rain between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of up to 25 centimeters," weather.com reported.
Rosa will pull north along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull further up through Arizona and into southern Utah Tuesday night.
"The biggest danger with Rosa or the remains of this is a lot of rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the American Southwest drought," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening floods in desert areas and landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested, suspected of murder after a 16-year-old was found the knife piece in Somerset, England.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 04:00 on Saturday.
He was transported to hospital, and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police report.
Police have urged people who may have mobile footage of what happened, to contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh "smiled" during how "bad and angry" Democrats were against him
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the merciless and unreasonable tactics of the Democrats," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffering" during how "bad and angry" the Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying emotionally the guilt of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her charges during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people got to see how brilliant and brave" Kavanaugh was that day.
"A vote of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, a lawyer with flawless service in public," he told a crowd of followers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the U.S. midterm elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not asking, but I'm really asking," he said.
"That's why I'm traveling around to fight for good candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are looking to “resist and block.”
The first important vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a Republican representative told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, death toll rises
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them captured by huge waves on beaches, while a powerful earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to take part in a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six metres high, hit the beach at sunset, taking many people as they destroyed everything they came across.
The tsunami came after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who did not leave at once and so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's crisis relief agency BNPB, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami was not enough in itself, he took cars, logs, houses; he hit everything on land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed into trees to avoid the tsunami and survived in this way.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the crisis agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake could be noted in the surrounding area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Bureau of Testing and Testing of Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday, was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the atomic bomb on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the deceased have been found during the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and the size of the destructions may be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"We haven't heard anything from Donggala, communication is cut" said Nugroho.
"More than 300,000 people live there," stated the Red Cross, adding that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," said the Red Cross.
The crisis agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said waves came within the time period that had been notified.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building screaming desperately to people down the streets to warn them of the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hit the coast, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video with the first.
The quake and tsunami caused power outages and cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate emergency aid.
The military has started the process of sending in cargo planes with emergency assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities report, but the refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened to receive emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
It was planned that President Joko Widodo would visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely to Palu city, and have set up tents in the back yard of their office. On their way to the city, they passed the totally destroyed areas, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
As emergency relief organizations begin work to help those affected by the tsunami, some have complained that foreign emergency aid workers with expertise in crisis management have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organizations and their employees cannot start work until Indonesia has declared the area a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's a provincial-level crisis," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"When the state says "OK, this is a national crisis," we can open up for international emergency aid, but they haven't updated the status yet."
It is night again in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and the friends and family of those still missing still hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not end well.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had a doctor trapped next to her dead mother for two days.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders from the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man called Mandagi said that some of those trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As someone with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon said he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to the Palu paragliders, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after hearing that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only a gray hook, instead of two blue hooks.
"I think it means the messages didn't come out," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 from minibank in Newport, Levee, United States
On Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's company worker in what he was filling up a mini bank in Newport, Levee, United States, according to a press release from Newport police.
The worker had just emptied a mini bank in the entertainment area and was about to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy stated in the press release.
While the worker was busy, "a man jumped up behind the worker" and stole a sack of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects as they escaped from the scene, according to the press release, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the robbery.
If anyone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes name - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, writing, "Creation formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as a nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came just before he was to perform on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show after she canceled due to "emotional reasons," said the program host.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think the word "ye" is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," West said earlier this year when discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The name has changed from Kanye, meaning the only one, to only Ye – to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are.”
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who has changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West before, has also changed the spelling of the name with and without dashes and capital letters.
Future President of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians
The future President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians. The country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military shot peaceful protesters and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements spread to Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening more free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have caused young people to join criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Investment in Artificial Intelligence
Since China is working more actively with artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government spoke out about artificial intelligence, although the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the budget for artificial intelligence research would be a good start, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
A doubling in funding could double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month via publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Managing Director (CEO) of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest-ranking player of the game Othello, and later worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was chairman of Google in China.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions organized by the U.S. state, such as the "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked what time the next competition would be, so he would join and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired excellent students from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen research on artificial intelligence.
"I believe that doctoral students in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically granted residence permits," he said.
The Chinese Council of State published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Federation of Natural Sciences funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the U.S. National Federation of Science and other state organizations' way of distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of a committee for artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI (artificial intelligence) Next.
The National Science Federation invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on the national security and artificial intelligence bill for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum if they should change the name of the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a claim to their territory, and has used vetoes to vote against membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change may undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott has raised doubts about the extent to which the referendum will reach the at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question on the referendum seat is: "Are you for NATO and EU membership and agree on the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth membership in the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independence after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not binding under the law, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
In order for the name change to take place, Parliament needs two-thirds resolution.
The State Election Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened by 1:00 p.m.
Only 16 percent had voted, as opposed to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters had voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the Strumika referendum in Macedonia for whether to change their name and open to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the referendum in front of the Parliament of Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that NATO membership will attract investors to Macedonia, which has over 20 percent unemployment.
"I believe that the majority will vote for the change, of your 80 percent of our citizens will become a member of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that a "yes" result can be interpreted as a "location of our future."
A poll last Monday by Macedonia's Department of Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are going to take part in the referendum – which is below the required number.
Another opinion poll by the Telma TV channel in Macedonia, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said 70 percent would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to close, at least 50 percent must vote, plus one vote.
If the referendum does not close, it could damage the policy of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling wrecked the Brighton defence which led to a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy, scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian leader accepted a pass on the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He crashed past three Brighton defensive players and reached open ground.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender, before running past several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty field.
He got past a pass on the left and found Sterling.
The English tip used his first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot right into the right end of the goal.
"Aguero is still struggling with his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him being able to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave the sky blue the first advantage in the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep inside the Brighton territory.
He kicked the ball beautifully along the left end of Leroy Sane's path.
Sane held on to the ball while he led Sterling towards the goal.
The sky blue tip kicked the ball into the goal right before slipping out of the track.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will play spoilers against the Rockies in American baseball
With the Nationals eliminated from "playoff contention", there was little reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a high competitive instinct, hoping to take the "mouth" on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to a "playoff" for the Rockies, who are leading with one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least 5–2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but are looking forward to securing the first division title.
"Although we're not playing for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who wouldn't want to play with such conditions?"
It is still unknown who will start in the Nationals on Sunday, but it may be that Scherzer will "pitch".
Scherzer, who then starts for the 34th time, threw a "bullpen session" on Thursday and will "pitch" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, coming from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 "innings" this season.
Trump Gathers Voters in West Virginia
The president referred in an obscure way to his first election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about how important it was for Republicans to vote in the U.S. midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't run, but I run everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are convinced that they are absolutely going to take back power, you see how ugly they are, how ugly they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "oppose and block."
"And you can see it based on the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "mindful and bad and disgusting and dishonest."
He referred to Senator and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who had his audience bowing.
"Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who leaked the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh no, I'm waiting - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They are intolerant of those who say what they think
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was not surprising.
I'm the last in a series of Labour MPs who have been told that I'm not welcome - just to say what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she protested anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of how important it is to run responsible economy, national security, Europe, and other similar topics that Jeremy ironically disagreed with previous leaders about.
In the call for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it stated "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
In my last eight years as Labour MP, the Friday meeting has been just like that.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not like this, and the promise of a "skiller" policy has long been forgotten, if it was followed at all.
It has become more and more clear that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that every opinion is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when colleagues I used to agree politically with suddenly expected that I would change my mind and agree on things I would never agree on - whether it was about national security or the internal market in the EU.
When I speak publicly it has nothing to say what I say, I always get bored on social media and people want me to go off while they criticize the center politics and say I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get the gender-discriminatory and racist chicas directed at each other every day, and who are still professional and do not quit.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period is how normalized it has become to harass police officers.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should be more tolerant.
In fact, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. For every distrust proposal and for every change in party rules, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I have received many advice over the past two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I joined Labour, when I was still in school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry at Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was about to fall apart, so I wanted better public services for those who needed them most - whether it was as a councilor or as a councilor.
I have never hidden my political opinions, even in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East may have been in doubt as to what I stand for and which of the current leaders I disagree with.
To those who voted for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country comes up against a Brexit that will harm private, local businesses and public services, I don't understand why people care about wasting energy on questioning my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, then the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters of the constituency, whether they are Labour voters or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that nobody can make me go off or change my policy and prevent me from serving you the way I think is best for everyone.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to the top in Scottish rugby
Two late "tries" may have changed the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
They are now on top of the pallet as the only unbeatable team of a total of ten.
It was their superb defense and ability to take chances that gave the home team and their coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be happy.
"We've been tested in recent games, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr earns praise, they were smarter than us to take chances."
Grant Anderson had a "try" for the 14th minute, when Frazier Climo tried a "conversion," which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes of the Warriors allowed Melrose to gather, and Jason Baggot took an "unconverted try."
Climo received a penalty just before the break, he scored and "converted" a "solo try" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's "try," which became "converted" by Baggot, reduced the sling money by five points.
A long break occurred when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and put on stretchers, and from the start, Ayr advanced through a "try" from Stafford McDowall, as Climo "converted."
The acting captain for Ayr, Blair MacPherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrose tried an "unconverted Bruce Colvine try," at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball from the penalty lineup, MacPherson scored a "try."
Climo "converted" again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's "box kick" and sent "flanker" Gregor Henry away from the home team's fifth "try."
The star of the Scottish series, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant industry
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor will not comment on the case, but a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper has hinted that Kiernan would engage in the "successful restaurant industry" in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivia hopes the court will open waterways to the Pacific
Sailors patrol marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flag with sea blue flags.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours. We are right
and the duty to return to it."
In landlocked Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastline lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict over resources of the 19th century, longing to sail in the Pacific again.
These hopes are perhaps stronger than in many decades while Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice to come on October 1, after five years of zoning.
"Bolivia has drive, peace of mind and is united, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians come to view the judicial separation from the International Court of Justice, in the hope that the Court of The Hague supports Bolivia's claim, and that Chile - after decades of negotiations - gives Bolivia an independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native President of Bolivia - who is striving to be re-elected next year - has good reason to hope for a positive result.
"Now we will soon be returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts don't think the court is going to allow Bolivia access to the sea - and that little would have changed even if they got access.
The Netherlands-based UN Court of Justice has no power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the court ruling comes just six months after the last negotiations, indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The last four years have far from advancing Bolivia's cause, they have done the opposite.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales, with his warlike rhetoric, has killed what was left of Chile's goodwill, Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open new relations with Chile" and a chance to "put a line at 139 years of indifference and rather benefit both," he said.
Calzadilla also rejected that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime issue to win votes.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"Judgement is an opportunity to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they will not abolish nuclear weapons if they cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation cannot be the first to abolish, if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to follow up on the promises they made during the meeting in Singapore between the U.S. and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when the United States' Secretary of State, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to restart his locked-in nuclear weapons diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the United States has a false hope that North Korea will submit if the United States continues with sanctions and opposes any declaration of the end of the Korean War.
Washington refuses to agree to a possible declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang abolishing it first.
Both Kim and the US President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
However, many are critical that Pyongyang is serious about the decommissioning and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows massive headlines are the latest fashion on the way to a shopping street near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you no longer need to search.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of large and special main garments in their SS19 collection. The main garments surprised the public during the fashion week in Paris.
Highest impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was a lavish, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, at brake that covered the models' heads.
There were also other oversized accessories under the fashion show, including a jeweled watermelon, a wizard hat, and even an pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks – just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn together and resembled more of Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in biscuits.
If you like this hugely dramatic fashion, you can just forget about it.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats come for sale in a shopping street near you.
The oversized hats come right after "La Bomba", the straw hat with the 60-centimeter-wide brake that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult merchandise brand behind the highest impractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent a new creation out on the catwalk - a straw beach bag of the same size as the bikini-dressed model that carried her.
The beach bag, with the color of burnt orange and fringes topped with a white leather handle, was the most conspicuous part of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during the fashion week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt it is possible to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Global Citizens Need Language Skills
Private schools in Scotland are known to be at a high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with excellent exam results, which are only enhanced by individual and joint success in sports, arts, music and other community measures.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), work to provide the best services to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for continuing and higher education, career paths, and the role of global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot just lean on English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By looking at the exam results from this year, we can see that language is at the top of the league tables with the highest standing grades for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who took foreign language received A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, shows that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital properties, which children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Languages as electives are considered equivalent to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering studies, and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey conducted by the British selection of additions and properties showed that 17 percent of employers struggled to fill positions due to lack of language skills in the applicants.
Therefore, it is more and more important with language in school to prepare youth for work life.
With multiple job opportunities for language experts, these properties are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what kind of career a youth chooses, if they have learned a second language, they have a proper advantage in the future with such a property.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person advantages in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult Britons in 2013, 75 percent couldn't speak any language other than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language to be spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different when it comes to the language in which they teach.
Many schools focus on the classical modern languages, while others teach in languages that are classified as important in the UK as we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a multitude of languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will prepare children and provide the properties they need to close, regardless of what the future brings.
One cannot deny that in this global, business-oriented environment, language is vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called "international communication properties."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, thus offering diversity and high competence for Scotland's young people.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait time is soon up for fans looking to see LeBron James debut on the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how long he is going to play has not been determined yet.
"It's going to be more than a minute and less than 49," Walton announced on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweeted that James will most likely play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the preseason.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to get me ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled stops the coming week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending to elect to fill the Supreme Court's vacant position, Trump aims to build support for upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when votes are due in November.
What time is Trump going to be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely address this week's hearings by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense over allegations of sexual abuse, with an expected confirmed vote from the Senate pending for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this pile of collections is to help Republicans face the November election and get some momentum (drive).
Thus, President Trump's campaign says that these five gatherings next week are aimed at "raising volunteers and supporters that Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season," a Trump campaign spokesman said that he refused to be informed to Reuters.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the gathering of the evening may bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in demand in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a boost in opinion polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows stomach for fight to keep hope alive on the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup in.
The swinging pendulum of moments is a completely invented sports intervention, but one that players really believe in, and never more than at competitions like these.
So where would they say that moment is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so we take it as a little moment , I guess," Jordan Spieth said as he walked off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points lead with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, know that they have some wind in their sails, and they have a lot to encourage by, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and rents by example.
The boytural screams of the celebration became higher as his round continued, seeking an important putt to take match four all-squao.re as he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His putt that won the match at 15, was met with a similar scream, the type that tells you he thinks the American team is not out of this.
"You've actually just got dug deep and worried about your own game," Spieh said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but cute couple are four out of four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on an 18 hole course) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, engaged audience, cementing that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European saying when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Talk about European honor will be still too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did brief work on Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine, dug the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never came close to climbing out.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between opponents, advice they give, and advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant lead into the final day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the stomach of the game that someone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe take 10-6 lead in Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge by two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their match so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side bid to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misplaced American side in tomorrow's fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in foursomes and won two games, but they could not bring in the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a disappointing weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their opening in four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they went so great as to beat an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more desirable 5 and 4.
Woods, who struggled through two games on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – ranked one and three in the world.
Europe still did not get everything they wanted on a pleasant, blown day southwest of Paris.
Three times big wins Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put the reference to the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 say over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point base and entered singles, although as holders, Furyk's side only needs to draw to retain the trophy.
However, after being the second best in two days, it looks like a Sunday counterattack will be outside of them.
North Korea says there is no talk of rusting down unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that if sanctions continue, the distrust of the United States will increase, and that the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Government's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures" to improve conditions in the past year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and promised not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we don't get anything similar back from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has made several complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phase" approach to the elimination of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be paid to take gradual steps, his resignation proved significant by not rejecting unilateral nuclear decommissioning, as Pyongyang has done in time.
Ri referred to a joint statement printed by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for "downgrading nuclear power on the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States insists on "downgrading nuclear power first" and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its purpose by force, and they even contradicted "the declaration to end peace," Ri said.
"Trust that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when the sanctions continue, our distrust only grows."
Ri did not mention anything about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. President highlighted in the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, over the past five months and added: "If the party in this call for the denuclearization was South Korea, and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done"
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was not possible to stop North Korean missiles against the American mainland, after the evil President Trump called Kim a rocket man on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, echoed Kim's praise for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that much work still had to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place until North Korea decommissions its nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the U.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, the United States' Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the F.N.'s Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must still be maintained vigorously and without fail until we get the complete, final, verified decommissioning of the nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to scuttle funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sideline of the UN General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea condemns him for making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "similar measures."
He said that Kim had told him that the "similar measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalizing his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take courses in getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has helped all students get more sleep, in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture that goes on to study in caffeine all night long. That means that you use caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
An academic found that top university students are often careless when it comes to the very basics - how to take care of yourself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact sleep deprivation has on learning.
"At the end of it a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I being told this now, in adulthood?"
She said that nobody had ever told her about the importance of sleeping - something that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, students explain what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after students got seriously worse sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, coaches and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, as well as how important it is with evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, Prof. Czeisler added.
The pride culture of the day still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoiding gaining weight, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in sweltering mode and makes them constantly sweltering.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, having been a student with him the previous year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push on to get a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before starting at the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, and also for when to wake up, and be aware of the deleterious effects of "blue light" coming from electronic displays and LED lighting, and who can convert the inner clock into something else.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal gives Gerrard's men down
The Rangers went on another defeat on the away field when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's uncovered side to a 1–0 loss to Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to take their first win off the field since the 4–1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but the team of Gary Holt caused only Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a leader, giving eight points, a round under Ladbrokes leader of the Premier League , Hearts.
Menga hit to seven minutes before halftime, and a Ranger setup with lack of inspiration never seemed to equalize.
As the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be additional problems in stock for Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound, after an item was apparently thrown from the away side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt , on the other hand, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shirt last week, and he would have been thrilled with the way his well-dressed suit took the vault roof of his opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have had the ball the most , but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored after only two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed in his fighting chance.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the return post.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morellos certainly knew that he would have had a penalty on the 20 metre mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away desire to the Colombian.
Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly concerned by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the rules of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it just because of the "shot".
Again, the Rangers failed to handle a deep dead ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard left in the break as if he exchanged Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange caused an immediate impact as the winger made a hatch for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly raced forward to block.
However, Livingstone continues to outperform the guest team to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett broadcasting longshots on longshots.
Holt's team could have increased their lead at the end, but McGregor succeeded in preventing Jacobs from it, until Lithgrow added a long post from the corner mark.
Ranger's reserve, Glenn Middleton, had a new demand for punishment when he supported with Jacobs, but again Thomson ignored it.
Almanack: The inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE RECEIVE ... the day when he who was to become the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific bearer ever since, the Geiger counter also became a bearer in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the seemingly unlikely late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the whole world is it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of atoms coming off the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Yes, now it's bubbling!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that asks his name lives on.
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to "see" red cells.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" red cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common to many cancers, and then re-ignit
A sample vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced that ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory, allowing them to "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-enlisting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drive the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer," explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" them how they target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West ordered a Pro-Trump diatribe, wearing a MAGA lue, after he visited the TV show Saturday Night Live. .
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was taped into the studio during Saturday Night Live after an incredible performance in which he praised the United States' president, Donald Trump, and said he would run for election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great caps, gave the Democrats a tirade and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white person, and they say, 'How could you like Trump, he's racist?'
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
The SNL started the show with a number along with comedian Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's selection of the charges of sexual assault from Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's tirade footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to mock West with the post.
West had also complained to the public that he had the difficult backstage due to his main garment.
“They moved me behind the scene.
They said, Don't go out there with that hat on.
They're moving!
And then they say I'm in a submerged place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken place?" says that he would "take on the Superman caps, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments led to pipe-out at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed embarrassedly affected, Variety reported, with a person telling the publication: "The whole studio was deadlocked."
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her former girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted, "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR STAYING UP TO THE BUILDING."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "quite simply was just who he is and it's absolutely amazing."
"But I did NOT choose to pay anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art') that I believe embraces and spurs out ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
That's us too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Co-rappers, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the last music legend Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington goes out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's select medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has gone out against the macho hero's stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen often lead young boys to feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "quite strongly" to address the problem.
"Personally, I'm convinced that something has gone wrong with masculinity." he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very male characters.
He continues: 'What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on television and in the streets, what makes young boys feel that they have to be this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones precursors or sequels when the series ends this summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The scout recently revealed that he is looking at the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so that way it gave me my future family and my life on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the award-winning Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the amount of people who received HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health personnel said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination by LGBT/HBTQ people is claimed to be widespread.
Because of the conservative values in the country, studies have shown that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to add lacquer information from the GOP senator, it explodes in 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
United States Rep. Maxine Waers on Saturday condemned allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were pedaled by "extreme-right wing" investigations and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released included informational home addresses and telephone numbers of Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and released the information to a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This groundless claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continues.
"One of my employees - who has received their identity, personal information and security compromised as a result of these unfair and false claims - was in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's phrase quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they don't have to be angry.
They don't have to be tough.
They must not question the motives of the debtor.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer proved to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being seemingly too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to take over Water's place in the midterm election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he tweeted.
In her resignation, Waters said her office had notified "the right governments and the law enforcement units of these false claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continues, "and that they will be kept legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my employees."
Johnny English strikes again - spy tull of weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit peculiarities in all new films with a British angle, and it seems applicable to this revival of Johnny England's action comedy spoof franchise – which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-ironic satire that re-examines how open we are will be the new export opportunity in the country?
In any case, the grandiose, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber ducklet has for the second time renewed his license to fuck things up - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comics creator for movie viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, he is the foolish, secret agent who despite his bizarre desire to spread some glamour has gotten a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with a simple tune to the Fire Trucks, theme during the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
He is also originally based on the travelling and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos in the aftermath.
There are one or two nice moments in this last JE excursion.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armor suit while the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is on screen, but the humor feels quite weakened and strangely superfluous, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible even now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny England's noisy accident is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's replica-clad cloth in the person in Bean.
The permanent current trend now is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all agents Britain has in the area, to the horror of the agent at work - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and war-torn figure, who already has a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is not so much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that once every active spy has been charged, she must bring in someone who is retired.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at some elegant establishment , but provides unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a couple of fine jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type academy for espionage.
English is sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, transferred to a submarine driver's job, an over-enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little thrown away.
So Batman and Robin's ability to make things terribly crazy in Her Majesty's Secret Service is back for full in the encounter with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the charismatic technology billionaire's spell, claiming he can solve Britain's data problem: the terrible Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farce-like wild games: disguised as waiters, set them fire to a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle themselves aboard Volta's yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make Vol's familiar.
All the stops are certainly pulled out to the last sequence, but as loving and undisciplined as it is, there is quite a lot of children's TV all over.
Quite a moderate thing.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talents?
Labour denies that they are preparing a plan for the English people to work a four-day week, but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is now considering a radical plan that wants the British to work a four-day week - but get paid for five.
The party will, according to the report, send further savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees, by giving them an extra day off.
Then the employee would be able to enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to increase benefits for workers.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changed economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It does not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a desire that fits into the approximate party has to balance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 election campaign.
However, the ambition is currently not approved by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said, 'A four-day work week is not party policy and it is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's working conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "profiters" in wealthy businesses.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that current shareholders in the waterfront cannot get back their entire effort as a Labour government could make "drafts" due to perceived misconduct.
He has also confirmed plans to put employees in corporate boards and created Inclusive Ownership Funds (including equity funds) to provide 10 percent of the equity in private sector ventures to employees, who would receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500, approximately $5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells in the TV show "60 Minutes" if the FBI's in investigation by Kavanaugh could get them to change their mind
The FBI investigation into complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question of the extent to which the agency's findings could affect some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview sent Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in "60 Minutes" asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could uncover anything that would cause them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said on my way into the hearing, I said, I have spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was determined, determined, expansive.”
Graham's voice, however, appears to be set in stone.
"I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she names couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an enormously impressive array of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park's large lawn, not only to enjoy watching Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes perform, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert announcers had to complete a number of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteer work; send email to a world leader, call a phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal.
But how much success has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of paying people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clickivism" - people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, and participated in and pushed for a variety of goals.
It states that these actions have contributed to world leaders being able to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements as a result of their shares, of which at least $10 billion have already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funds so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs committed to "helping children reach their full potential"; pledges to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving two more than 4,700 deleters globally.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," — told the ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to demand that the UK improve nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional treatment.
In response to one of the common questions on their website, they ask, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizens replied, "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among some of the actors performing at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Fleet as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington may "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, International Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to convey energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has this ability, with our Fleet, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group presenting themselves as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic solution on Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The declarations come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to increase the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
In connection with this, officials of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "undesirable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's zealous opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. attitude has withdrawn backlash from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "run hard" to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would take a "fundamental look" at running as a presidential candidate after the midterm election.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our poor government, and that includes a woman at the top," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider thoroughly running as a presidential candidate."
Warren took on President Donald Trump during the city council meeting and said he "leads this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren has been shocked in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
A poll released on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should run as a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run as a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a round of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed regarding a potential 2020 nomination, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being enlisted in September.
He was arrested and charged with an armed incident in the home on Monday night
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, allows me to relate to other families characterized by PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little changed, they come back the hardened, they come back and wonder about the respect for what they and fellow soldiers and airmen and all other military, have done for the country, exist".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with physical violence in the home against a woman, for interfering with a report of violence in the home and the storage of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy
Eighty states and districts of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or home violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-right brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions fits that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) filed in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the elective gang members' sons" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The attorneys of the States supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for American asylum, as nations face pervasive problems with gangs and elected in the home.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from the Immigration Act, which allowed illegal immigrants who fled violence at home, to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires all asylum cases to be judged for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle to the violation of this principle," said friend-of-the-court card.
Lawyers further claimed in the summary that policies that deny immigrants access, hurt the US economy, and say they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer provide asylum to victims who fled abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," said Sessions in its June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems - even all serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu as death toll doubled in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly serious.
"It feels very exciting," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever-stricken baby son at an evacuation center in the devastated city, Palu.
"Every minute ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is hard to find."
Residents have been observed on their way back to their destroyed homes, in what they search through water damaged properties and tried to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals destroyed by the earthquake, which had a strength of 7.5, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to still strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes while telling him that he knew the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe."
US ambassador blames China for "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a 4-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper and highlighted the mutual benefits of trade with the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid allowances in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's largest salsa newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, a debt China denies.
Trump's guilt that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an increasing trade war that has seen them in turn increase taxes on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to meet exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
“China,” Branstad wrote in a poll in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now doubling the bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
"In its dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's beloved tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic path, given that the media is below the fixed thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers deviated from the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what for a newspaper.
Republicans are urging female voters to lead the midterm with Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts warn.
As many top Republicans are stand-by and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple charges of sexual assault, the analyst has warned that they will probably see a setback, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The feelings around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record that they already wanted to move on with a vote.
These things cannot be denied, says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants chanted "November is coming!" while demonstrating in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who govern the court committee, chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be off the chart," Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news page.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But there may be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while not liking the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual assault directed at incumbent Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggested a setback could follow if the Republicans pressed forward with the confirmation.
"This has been a confused root of the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early in the previous week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee or final vote or whether Kavanaugh is seen on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities United States, a group that contributes to electing Democrats, pointed out the news.
But the Americans seem to be a little split over who they are supposed to believe in in the wake of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more sidetracking with the latter.
A new YouGov opinion poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and also at least another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee during the previous week that Kavanaugh completely assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her gender organs while attending a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup seeking to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company building Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and what for people who have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said of the start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data warehouse" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, reminder lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the managing director of the company John Bruce, is that the company should bring resources, processes, and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some additional developers with contracts to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google not to introduce a complete change in which all their business models are completely turned on their heads overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new online collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been a voice with great influence in the debate on net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era online," added Berners-Lee ten l.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross divine celebration
The only English church deity to win a Victoria cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in their hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic", that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt Col Water led its battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through a very thick shot and under heavy fire from fields and machine guns."
He later ran up to the front line, and with the "greatest gallantry" the line led forward before solo rushing forward with a field gun and striking out three of the group.
Lt Col Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm humbled for."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to play a role in the parade, adding that "the value of a real hero is shown by the support given by many people."
MMA fans were up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a packed Bellator 206 but then you won't see the main event.
The San Jose account contained 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., precisely in what Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald are preparing to meet, viewers in the UK were again stunned as the covers changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were little impressed after they had stayed awake to the early hours especially for the match.
A fan on Twitter described switching to the children's comic book series as "a kind of sick joke."
"It is public regulation that at 6 a.m. if the content was not proper like this, then they had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transfer.
"The Peppa Pig, "Yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will work on planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about replay, I think we can probably figure it out," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, and we don't find out about this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it passed, there were many texts that went back and forth, and all were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We hold it to five games instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to surrender to the fans, and we just went over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley knew himself 'underdog' due to sexuality
Olympic stud Tom Daley says that in his upbringing he felt worse than anyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular reporter in the cross-country show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
What could look like a missing person in Laverne's first program, Daly said he felt "less than" anyone else growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to equal boys and girls."
He said, "From today, the feeling of feeling less than and feeling different, would be the real things that have given me strength and strength to succeed."
He would prove that he was "about," he said, so he did not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has been a professional LGBT campaign and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live open without reasoning and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and declines.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his whole "his" perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about I need to win a gold medal," he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked for was if they had tickets to London 2012 – when he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you're not going to be on the front row," he said.
"I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - diving in in front of a home crowd at an Olympic game, where fans had no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud of Heather Small - which had vibrated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs are on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape sit Mickelson on the bench at the Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he must turn his form to avoid that it is an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12 time, was seen on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time grand winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working with his game within the reach of the hope of correcting what bothers him.
Never the most competent cross-country skiers. Not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is best at hitting with the cross-country skiers on the narrow, French main course, where balls hit outside if the golfer is not accurate with the bat.
And if the track itself is not scary enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth game Sunday, the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 singles games, come to a warm start, Mickelson's match can be completely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he played two games.
I looked at myself more, but that's how it was, and that's how we thought we had to do.
He will be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never fully matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said that his proximity added some intangible properties to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to keep fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the storage room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had the fun that got a deal with him too, this week, which was fun to watch.
He contributes with much more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead on the way into the last few days singles in the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride.
Denmark made their debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the finish line with the nose leading with the narrowest margins, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You continued to remind yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far," said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, after he had seen Klassa 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
You're going to the full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I've said all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's on the other side - the biggest actors in the world."
Glad to see how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: "I would never take the win in advance.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow it is the individual achievements that come out, and that is another thing to do.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there individually, you’ll be fully tested out of your capacity as a golfer.
It's the message you need to convey to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he has to go and get the best out of himself too."
In contrast to Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the spin-offs in the past few days, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before quitting as a loser when Europe went off the "Miracle of Medinah."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had gathered his players on their way into the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get started with the quick start you saw at Brookline, which you saw at Medinah.
When that moment is allowed to go one way, put a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our line-up accordingly and set the boys up in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow" .
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the match and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the scheme.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," Bjorn said of his choices of singles.
Germany's new warship appointed once again
The latest frigate of the German Navy was reportedly ordered in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War period, but it will not be there until at least next year due to faulty systems and outrageous costs, local media reported.
The launch of Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuertemberg-class ships the Navy ordered back in 2007, come as a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from the ports at home.
However, continuous delays mean that the ground-breaking warships, which supposedly allow Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be outdated when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware flaws" that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software failures were especially important as the ships of the Baden-Wuertemberg class will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is dramatically overweight, reducing performance and limiting the ability of the fleet to add to future upgrades.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the price of the entire project - including training the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems related to the newest frigates, become especially important in light of the latest warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence selection, acknowledged that the fleet actually "has almost ended on distribution competent ships".
The officer said that the problem has been built on itself over time, because old ships were decommissioned, but no replacement ships were delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust Steals Secret Life of Flagger Mouse
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how the bats use the landscape in hunting for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipsitrels and also brown lang<0xC3><0xB8>ra and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and what species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural science advisor to NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat, natural homes, are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the acquisition of meadows and how best to maintain equal forest areas for bats and other related species.
Flagger mouse populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the last century.
They are believed to be of construction and development work that affects resting places and loss of habitat/bubbles.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, and also attacks by pet cats.
The flagger mouse is actually not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ecolocalization technique to find errors and obstacles in their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, restroom inspections, and sometimes save lives.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threadave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threadave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there's a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties, will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance within properties, since it is possible that endless destruction of a single habitat can kill up to 400 female bats and young people, and perhaps alienate an entire local population.
Flags are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are endangered."
Ronaldo Rejects Valdeckts Debts in German Lawyer sues German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has noted the electoral debts against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to stand out" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
Portugal and the Juventus forward have been accused of choosing an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, says to his 142 million followers just hours after the charges, that the charges are "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, the five-time Goldball winner says into the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They will be known to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all good," added the player and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an unauthorized reporting of suspicions within the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount that stands at how serious the rule violation is , which is probably one of the most serious breaches of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, claiming to have chosen her anal, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and failed by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an equalization because she felt "feared of retaliation" and was concerned about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to change residence as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' to lose car manufacturers
Britain "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "if" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of border delays in case a non-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with 90% being exported to the rest of the EU.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director of Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have raised fears of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns revolve around what car manufacturers say is the risk of supply chains in the event of a non-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37th minute from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, disruptions at the border that the industry says may result in delays and a lack of parts may occur.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production would be halted.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is "net top calibrated to avoid border controls."
"We need to have an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy the success today, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's daily program.
"The evidence from not only Toyota, but other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but in the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the facility, said that his members are more concerned with: "In my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
A spokesperson for the government said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with deputy head lawyer Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back a week" as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continued, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, connections between Trump's aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Corvid Trump will resign the general of the case lawyers or not, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, has given nourishment to Washington gossips for several months.
Earlier in the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing a conduit to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the UN in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying full voting from the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "No date has been set. It may be this week, but I can and see for myself that another week will be delayed due to everything else that happens in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters will probably disagree with it: Sanders has not held a press briefing for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of orientation was not due to an upset with TV reporters' game for the gallery, although she said, "I don't disagree that they do."
She mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
"The president holds more press conferences than any president has done before," she said - quite rightly without providing evidence of the claim. "We have looked at numbers."
Sanders says updates will still happen, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do it like that part, and you've seen us do it often in recent weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he travels from the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the president to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president perhaps demonstrated why, where he acted leading the reporters without shame, and almost bizarre.
Health Secretary writes about Brexit fears for EU workers on NHS in Scotland
The health secretary has written to EU workers working at the NHS in Scotland to express gratitude and a desire for them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, who is a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter although there are less than six months left before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to addressing the costs of applications that have status as determined for EU residents working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations on withdrawal between the UK and the EU have continued, and it is approaching the expected conclusion this fall.
However, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I realize this must be a difficult time for you all.
Therefore, I will now repeat how much I appreciated the contributions of all employees, regardless of what nationality they have.
Colleagues from the EU, and outside, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work in the health sector and are beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is clearly diving at home, and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays on the Tennessee State Tigers, went through an acute operation after pulling a head injury when the team lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennesseean newspaper.
Tennessee State head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, in a way," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him behind for further evaluation.
An official spokesman from Tennessee State, WSMV told the WSMV that Abercrombie was finished operating at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There are no details on the extent of the damage yet, Harris said, adding that Tennessee State is still trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes second year at the university, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before being injured in Saturday's game, and is now up in 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The extra income should be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The decision will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in the document fee will be added to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects an increase of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless
Theresa May will today announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The extra income will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who earn a lot, promising to offer affordable housing.
The increase in the document fee will be added to individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of commuters.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago at dwelling number two and rental dwellings, can be of as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects that the decision will bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by residents outside the UK, making prices higher, making it more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "spooky cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who reside most of the time in other countries.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson would cut in the document fee to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping prices up by acquiring property but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's "residential shame".
Corbyn has announced a series of conspicuous proposals for housing reforms, including controlled leases and the closure of shows for no reason.
He will and give the council greater power to build new settlements.
May said, "Last year I said that I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
That means fixing the destroyed housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it should be as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, or foreign firms, to buy housing as it is for hard-working, British residents.
For many people, the dream of their own habitat has come too far, and the humiliation of being circumspect is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate ambition" is to become a manager for Scotland at some point.
Scott (42) is happy with the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east. Currently, they are third in League One, just three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, having led St Mirren back to the Scottish Elite Series the previous season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-team match, and that's it," Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland on Hamden along with my father, and there has always been something that has pulled me back.
That opportunity can only come if I succeed as a club manager."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager, include Dick Advocate, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he has not been anxious to come up with so many established names in such a large club, since he has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I 'can get this club back in the Premier League.'
Given the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong at home in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably just look at myself as successful if I manage to get the club back there".
Ross is only three years into his career as a manager, after a period as an assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts coaching apparatus.
He then helped Alloa recover from drowning to the third level, transforming St Mirren, who was on his way down, into the title winner of the championship series the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now, than he ever did while playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a road split," he says of leading Alloa.
"I genuinely believed that being a manager suits me much better than being a player.
It sounded bizarre, because I did well, lit well and liked it relatively well.
But playing can be tough.
There are a lot of things you are eager to get through every week.
I still notice it when it comes to the stress and pressure with the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I have always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. It's the most comfortable thing I've felt in my own body in my entire adult life."
On Sunday, September 30, you can hear the whole interview at Sportsound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13 o’clock.
Survey shows that the perfect time for a half litre is 17.30 on a Saturday
The summer's heatwave has led to an increase in the intensity of struggling pubs in the UK, but and increased pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, the sales increased by 2.7 percent in the children's industry - but for the restaurant industry it declined by 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Business adviser Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: "Sustainable sunshine, and the fact that England were in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the June pattern where pubs went up 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder to frame.
The drop of 1.8 percent in the restaurant industry only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinks made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubs selling food, got and noticed the decline in the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It may seem like people will just go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the beverage sales had increased by 6.6 per cent this month, while food had declined by three per cent.
Paul Newman, travel and leisure analyst at RSM, said, "These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of an enormous social or sporting event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the outdoor industry.
It is no surprise that the restaurant industry will still be struggling. A 4.8 percent annual decline in sales would be a bad thing to get on top of a running cost pressure.
The long, hot summer couldn't come at a worse time for operators running food. Time will show if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can provide a long-awaited breathing room."
The total salsa spending across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the drop in the release of brands.

One in five children have secret social media profiles that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media profiles as they hide from parents and teachers, a survey shows
Survey of 20,000 students on progress reveals an increase in "false Insta" profiles
This news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" profile they show their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media profiles that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary school revealed a sharp increase in "false Insta" profiles - a reference to the image sharing platform Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a sterile "main" profile they refer to parents, while at the same time they and have private profiles.
A mother who stumbled across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager urging others to "choose me".
The research, done by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) at various schools, found that 40 percent of those between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private users.
HMC's head, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create places online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes ‘the voice of the athletes’ on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as the non-administrative director of the Board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated athletic athlete in Scotland, and chairman Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a lot of respect across Scotland, the UK and the world's athletic community, and we are confident that the athletics in Scotland can benefit from getting it into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm eager to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can be contributing and helping the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among his total four Olympic golds and is now a regular guest at the BBC, was unable to walk after a drop.
On Twitter, he wrote, "Today is a month since I got hit.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it was only time that could tell me if I was going to get well again, or to what extent.
It has been exhausting work, but I have become quite good again, learned to walk again, and today I do flexibility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Split opinions on the Internet about breast pump advertising comparing mothers with dairy cows
A breast pump company has split opinion on the Internet with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers with dairy cows.
To mark what is described as "the world's first stagnant, squeezing breast pump", the technology company Elvie released a small-scale advertisement inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom the new pump provides mothers who extract milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled barn with cows, to a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you didn't notice it, this isn't spinning, it's my tits."
The refrain continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
On the other hand, the advertisement, which is published on the company’s Facebook page, has created controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it highlights the "fear" of the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and feed to produce milk, only that the calves are trusted from the days just after birth," one writes.

Another commented: "Understanding enough traumatic for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their kids?"
Another added, "For a runaway ad."
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she thinks the song is "fixed."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I was still a grandmother.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This advertisement is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
This is a brilliant product," one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement boasting or judging the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump wrapped into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump, say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely quiet, has no pipes or pipes, and its discreet inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, keep their kids, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product, it deserves a daring and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extract milk and dairy cows, we wish to put the spotlight on breast pumping and challenges associated with this, while at the same time demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognisable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to tent camps on the Texas border
The number of jailed immigrant children has peaked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because of the strict policies the Trump administration has introduced making it harder to place the children at sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and accepting a child may threaten their own opportunity to stay in the country.
The risk of it increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members will be required to submit fingerprints, and that this data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement for Congress, testified and said the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to sponsor single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had nothing on their roll sheet from before.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are in the country illegal, and a large part of these are criminal aliens.
So we're going to continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
According to camp staff, new rules have now been introduced to handle the children. The rules require that some of them now have to go to court before a month has passed, against the previous 60 days.
Many will participate via video calls and not by personal attendance, to have their case tried lead an immigration judge.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to elective outbursts or escape attempts, say the employees in the camp. Reports that have appeared in recent months say the same.
Spokesmen say that these concerns are greater at large facilities such as Tornillo. Due to the size of the facility, it is more likely that signs of children's wear are overlooked.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or say hate to friends, can amplify trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria asks U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, although the country is now at war in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is serving as Deputy Prime Minister, said that advancing forces are staying illegally on Syrian soil during the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be treated in accordance with it".
"They must withdraw immediately and without preconditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight a holy battle entirely until all Syrian territory has been cleansed" for both terror groups and "the illegal presence of advancing."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
When talking about the refugee problems, Moualem said it was safe for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for having "spread irrational fears" about the circumstances that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return," he said.
"They are making policies out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help to bring about reconstruction in Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
UN diplomats say that a recently created agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, which is the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to continue pushing ahead with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement deterred a major attack from Russian-backed, Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters, who are associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be exterminated."
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war law for Syria, and pave the way for the election.
Moualem laid down the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution", warning against interference.
Why Trump is going to win another term
With that logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020 if not, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, the presidency gets an early end due to scandals and impeachment.
That would no doubt be "the most dramatic ending to a presidency ever!"
At the time of writing, there are no signs that the viewers have been bored.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating in best broadcast time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has nearly triple its to 1.6 million.
On average, Fox News has 2.4 million viewers in the best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has doctors at the top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million viewers on nights with big news.
"This is a fire that people are being lured by, because there is something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congressional building.
Nell Scovell, old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he replied according to Scovell.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, history coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself at the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of sources with "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostrich leather to $15,000, "an earring of Trump's garment", "an earring of the Post", "an earring of a Trump cloth", and "an earring of a Trump"
Personally, I'm never going to watch Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the daily head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pawn Stars", about the show that's going to take place with Trump's employees and daily disputes (go into a fight with the NFL, Joun-Rose Kim).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, otherwise you won't be hanging around anymore.
When I met Fleiss this week, there were over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat in and watched MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He failed to turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate commission and the future of the Supreme Court hung in a thin thread.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows before in time and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the tightest midterm contest
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a reshuffle of the congressional districts that resulted in two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
The newly converted suburban district of Pittsburg promotes Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election last spring.
Lamb fights another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today representative in the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, who largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The map was redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January determined that the old districts were illegally designed to benefit the Republicans.
The competition for the 17th district has launched a arms race on the funding of the campaigns, between the major parties' money arsenals, the Democratic Congressional Selection and the Republican Congressional Selection.
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a barely saying in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had belonged to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a scarce advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for support to China, but withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama to partners threw out the Trump organization's leadership group.
The State Secretaries decided to bring back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the ministry's spokeswoman, in a statement earlier this month.
But punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which contained cuts to financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the top administrators informed that they wanted the conference to continue, and therefore put a stop to the assessment of the punishment for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been scheduled in mid-October, as a signal on the relevance of the administration putting on the collection, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new tough messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton would not comment on the details surrounding the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the presumption of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an outside analyst working closely with the administration and also spoke under the pretense of anonymity.
Studying history
Special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, for which there is now significant evidence in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller is said to have focused on the investigation into whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia's idea of attacking our election.
If Congress were to change directors, Trump would have to stand up in this body, in what he prepares to convince voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There's a lot of "what ifs", and I don't mean to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable—nor for his counterpart in Europe.
There are choices to take for all of us on both sides of the pond, which will affect how prolonged the game can become.
By 1938, German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, only the West had stood up to him and helped the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed a chance to avoid the years of bloodbath this led to.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's relentless march is accelerated or postponed.
Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on deep water ever since this paper revealed that last year he proposed listening to the president in secret, and wondered if he is unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or is he accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm for a congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're wrong, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off guard to light Sabbath lights on the table asking for the swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that saying over the Austrians, after an impressive tie in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance this season before the 2–2 result against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the fight with the belief that we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could take it towards the end, but overall the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and were the better team.
On Thursday it will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough game. They got a good result in their previous game, but with the audience behind us I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been tough, with everything that has happened with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The stable is good and the boys thrive; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run on now, put the previous season behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that participants in a survey had clear thoughts about how they would be cared for, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in a survey by the insurance company Nationwide, said they spoke to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation," says Vice President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
This is where you start.
Talk to your spouse and your kids: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't want your familiar good time in the foreground.
Collaborate with a counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a big part of determining costs.
Bring in a financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance with cash value to help pay the expenses, or that you insure yourself with your own wealth – as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Reject legal battles before they start.
Get a health executive in place, so that you appoint a person you trust to oversee your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can even consider an authority for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid if you don't have the opportunity yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Make sure your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all of these details in a written plan, so you're ready.
"It's not just the finances it's all about, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
“What kind of medicine is it?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a severe earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, public officials say. The death toll is expected to rise.
Without the ability to communicate, aid workers have not received any information from Donggala, an area north of Palu located closer to the epicenter of the quake that had a magnitude of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. The estimated population in 2017 was 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is an area stretching over more than 300 km with coastline northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farm operations are the mainstay of the economy of central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is and important in the province, but is mostly concentrated to Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Reduction Office.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and several hundred houses destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the western side of Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Seismic Fire in the Pacific and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major quakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major quake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of major quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and the beginning of April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake struck southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that crashed into the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake hit one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of about 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A small quake hit the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh causing destruction and panic when people were reminded of the quake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost their lives due to buildings crashing.
2018: Large quake hit the tourist island of Lombok and kills more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested and charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested, charged with assault.
According to a report released by Alaska State Police, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence and opposing arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the violations.
Palin is being held in custody in the Mat-Su prison, and is being held against bail $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court Saturday and declared himself "not guilty" when asked, stating the network.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he can be jailed for up to one year and get $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which can be punished with a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time Palin has been charged with anything criminal.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is up in Alaska's vet court.
In January 2016, he was charged with assault in the home, interference in a reporting of violence in the home and possessing a weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he hit her in the head.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran groups after linking her son's selective behavior to PTSD that stems from when he served in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds lost their lives
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake, with a magnitude of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed several thousand homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down, and numbers of the dead are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawesi, located northeast of the capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the dramatic moment of how the quake hit, flourish on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors will have rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror
Federal prosecutors in New York will have the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected in the terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been carried out for a federal offense in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway on lower Manhattan in October, when he drove down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, the prosecutors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "willfully" and that he "willfully" inflicted them serious, bodily harm, according to a note filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may be the basis for a possible death penalty, the court document states.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 indictments, including eight counts of murder with the aim of money-expression, usually used by federal prosecutors in connection with organized crime, and one count of election and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and persuasion," the actors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as "horrible, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullahevic Saipov caused injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Paganucco", it states in the note.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is ten years since the last time the southern district of New York has sentenced the death penalty in a case.
The target, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two doppelgangers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done felt good, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, it is in the indictment.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He has not pleaded guilty to all charges.
David Patton, one of the federal, public defenders representing Saipov, says they are "clearly disappointed" with the decision of the prosecution.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma from the event for everyone involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked the actors not to go after the death penalty.
Tory MP believes Nigel Farage should hire Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today, during a protest at the Tory National Assembly.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said that police officers had to "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics – one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should hire negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MEP Peter Bone told the Birmingham protesters that Britain "had been out" now, if Farage was Brexit minister.
With the challenge May faces of reconciling his deeply split ranks has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who wish to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister struggled to keep the plan with the Chequers compromise on the right track after attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers, and the EU.
The Allies insist that she will press on to get a deal with Brussels in place, despite the backlash – forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour Party to choose between her package and "chaos".
Bone told the Leave Means Leave grouping in Solihull that he wanted to "forgotten Chequers"
He suggested that Farage should be given a decent rank and been given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had ruled, we would be out now," he said.
The Wellingborough Member of Parliament, added, "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers".
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said, "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate.
We will make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejects the claim that the meaning of the people has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue".
Tory's Brexit campaigner, Andrea Jenkyns, also participated in the march. She told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people!"
"Chequers are not popular in the population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Please, drop the Chequers and listen.”
In a message directed at May, she adds, "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep what they promise".
Farage said police must "know the heat" if they were to betray the decisions made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that 'we're not going to let them get away with it.'"
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to get the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
"We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us say in Brexit and will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud UK.
At the same time, the Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the centre.
A handful of activists fanned the "Tories Against Brexit" banner after launching the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for security problems they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take a "careful look" at running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take "a careful look at running for president" following the November election.
Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a town meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was but as a board member of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been the center of much speculation that she may want to try against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday, was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump joined.
One participant asked if she had plans to run for president.
Warren responded that it is time "for women to take the trip to Washington to fix our ruined government, and that includes a woman on top."
Arrest made in the shooting of Louisiana State University player Sims
Police in Baton Rouge announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the case where basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), Wayde Sims, was shot and killed Friday.
At 11.00 local time, police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), in a press conference for ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen on the video clip.
The Sims (20) was shot and killed early Friday in the southern area of the university.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, writing 247sports.
Wayde went in to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In debriefing, Simpson has admitted that he was on the scene, with weapons, and admitted that he was scouting the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without drama and placed in custody at the police department in eastern Baton Rouge.
A third-year student of nearly two metres, waking up in Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games, ten of them from the start of the previous season, where he averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds in each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders give say over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the teams from Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start on the race, allowing Hamilton to take care of himself in defending his position in the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and allowed Hamilton to enter traffic at the back of the course, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton ended up ahead after some action side-by-side which meant that the Ferrari driver reluctantly had to let the inside be free in order to not be able to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, on the back row and was in seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led much of the race going for a quick finish with a goal to run past Kimi Raikkonen who was fourth.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but failed to increase the speed of the last eight rounds while Raikkonen got fourth place.
It's a difficult day, for Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting Saturday due to her insistence that she did not leave the letter from Christine Blasey Ford where she sue Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony Ford had given to the Senate Commission directly, but rather commented that what is going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad and cruel and spoke wrong".
"The disgusting thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and uncomfortable and speaking falsely," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks and then say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember diving?
Dianne Feinstein, are you kidding me?
Remember her answer... you licked the document - "Oh, eh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lick it."
Wait a moment.
Lay us... No, we didn't," he added, while mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it became a play earlier in September – but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which she asked for."
But her refusal did not fall into good soil with the president, who commented it at Saturday's election meeting: "I say you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged with misconduct by three women, the president proposed that Democrats use the charges for their own gain.
"They are determined to take back power in all the ways they seem necessary.
You see the malice, the cruelty, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run to get power and control over," the president said according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants (5-3)
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee stars compensated for the loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants received an early two-point lead due to attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized before Dwyer once again sent the Giants in the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the league this season for Adam Keefe's boys, who defeated Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between teams this season, where the Giants have won the last three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute after an assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford served an assist to Beauvillier who doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan got the home team back in the game in the 14th minute, before Matt Marquardt ensured Cownie's equalisation in the 16th minute.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead into the break as he scored his second goal for the night on the tam of the first half.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard once again ensured an equalization with a brilliant goal after 27 played minutes.
Late in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen secure Dundee's lead for the first time in the game, securing the victory with the fifth goal for the team in the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, meet Milton Keynes at home in the next game, which is on Friday.
Air traffic controllers lose their lives to ensure hundreds of aircraft escape earthquake
A flight leader in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he lost his life in what he continues to ensure that an aircraft with several hundred passengers got safely up in the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disrupt the area, and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, Anthony Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, although it turned wild.
He stayed to make sure that the plane that was on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower when he thought it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid the number of deaths will increase to thousands, while the country's crisis relief agency says access to the small towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is increasing as we find bodies trapped under buildings, many of which we cannot reach," said office spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres have destroyed Palu, who is scheduled to hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Emergency aid comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with multiple bodies.
It is difficult to find clean water.
The small shops have been robbed.”
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is striving to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the military In the country: "I ask you all to work around the clock to do everything they can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was earlier this year hit by earthquakes in Lombok, and 550 people died.
Micronesia flight: Air Niugini reports no man missing after lagoon flight crash
The airline operating a plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific reports that a man is missing, having previously stated that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane before it sank.
Air Niugini stated that as of Saturday afternoon they do not know where the male passenger is.
The airline said they are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not provide more details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people have been sent to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is still unknown what caused the crash and what actually caused it.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane was flying past the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to water through the water, reaching them to life, to the emergency exits of the plane before it sank.
He said the flight crew had panic and screams, and he sustained a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said nearby sailors, who were working on repairing a dock, also rescued passengers with a rubber boat that they used to transport passengers to land before the plane sank about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines' flights over the past 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analysts make timeline over the night as woman became burned alive
Prosecutors presented all evidence on Saturday during the alleged trial of a man charged with burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he co-wrote recordings from mobile phones to find out what her night was when Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett told me that he used location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis' mobile phone was with Chambers' mobile at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the defendant asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "laughing, because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
But their mobile phone accounts showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers died, Tellis deleted messages, conversations, and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is due to close the case on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial will go to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
New York babysitter sues couple for firing after 'racist' text message
A New York babysitter sues a couple to give her the kick based on discrimination after she received a false text message from her mother complaining that she was "just a black person."
The pair have denied that they are racist, and compared the lawsuit to "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was unhappy when she saw that the babysitter she had added, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEI, END A BLACK PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent him to the babysitter Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, the unsuitable Plasco-Flaxman babysitter Maurice fired, saying that the previous babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in an Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation for firing her. She wants $350 a day for the job she was supposed to have, even if it was without a contract, where she was going to live with her family.
"I'll show them that it's not okay to do that," she told The New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has denied that they are racists, saying that giving Maurice the kick was the only thing they could do after insulting her, by which they were afraid that she would take revenge.
"My wife had sent something to her that she didn't mean to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you have offended take care of your children, even if you didn't mean to offend them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "expression," saying his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you really going to attack a person in such a situation?
That's not a nice thing to do," said investor Plasco.
As the case progresses, the public has been quick to judge the couple on social media, criticizing them for their conduct and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid that people would not like a talking bear, reveals new letter
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It's very fun to know now how successful Paddington became."
Jankel said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected. She added that she had mixed feelings during the book's 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
As for Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was proud of the inside over how much success he made.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never screamed," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who achieved something: you become proud of them even though it's not really you who are behind.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was to die and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice in all haste, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was really bad, that they didn't think she was going to make it," Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear you.
I'm coming soon to be with you.
I'll be there soon.
The medicines doctors had given her for her heart to continue pumping were slowly moving out of her system.
She had already died and now her body was about to turn off.
I just sat there, knowing this happened.
I couldn't hale or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything inside."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane along with other passengers who did not realize what she had just gone through.
"Nobody knew anything," she said.
"I sat with my head bent while the tears fell."
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her."
Sorrowful women hang patches on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who took suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached patches on a bridge in Wales to inspire and get people thinking of taking suicide to change their mind and calling the numbers on the patches.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to struggle with depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day."
Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, said her son was a talented chef with a smile that infected.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said that his smile lit up all the rooms."
But before his death, he quit his job, because he was in a "really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the first to find Tyler after taking his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still concerned that your brother-in-law may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the notes "so that people should know that there are other people out there who care and with whom they can talk, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there alone – you have to talk to someone."
Humphreys, who has been Davis's friend for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told me he was upset or depressed or anything," she said.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed that he began to behave differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on Christmas Day, when the kids opened their gifts he didn't even look at them."
She told me that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continue to work through the trauma: "There's a big void in our family now.
We're completely destroyed.
But we all have to fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought that if we actually got something similar to what he's asking for - a limited investigation - then maybe we could achieve some loneliness," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he's afraid the committee "fell" in the middle of a partisan backlash.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The midterm elections in the United States are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans don't do well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then having been Bush's secretary.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They are going to vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh is able to gather at least 50 votes in the Senate. With 50 votes, Mike Pense, the vice president of the United States, can give him the final vote and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors 'going down' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator reports
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Ministry of Uniting, saying there were 1,127 defectors last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling charges are the main reasons for the decline in numbers.
Pyongyang has not made a public statement.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China views defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often sends them back by force.
Relations between North and South Korea – which is purely technically still at war – have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These talks come after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of achieving nothing since then.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot disarm our weapons first," Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," saying he can't serve in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said he has too much temperament to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know that if a woman had behaved that way, she had been called "hysterical," Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied all charges that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh's opening speech, he was very emotional and cried at times with lumps in his throat while telling about his family and years on the go.
He criticized the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and a planned attack on his reputation," organized by liberal politicians who were angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think the way he behaved disqualifies him, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi made an objection when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to resign if he is elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats achieve a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he can't serve in the Supreme Court, nor in the court he serves now," Pelosi added.
Kavanaugh is a judge in Washington D.C.'s federal appeals court.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat she is concerned about potential judges from Kavanaugh against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions about whether he would turn certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court who expects us to say he's great," Pelosi said.
And women must swing the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high firm position, who said she branched when she was angry, but developed a technique where she told the person who made her so angry that she branched, "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps going.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears act as a way to get your mind out, but there are many who misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories of a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I branched out of anger, and a woman older than me took me in the neck – she was a cold tenant that I had always been afraid of – and pulled me out at the same time.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and that they water because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a congresswoman, a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was caught out on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought she could just as well run for president herself.
"I didn't really think through it well enough," she told me while laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running for election, and the last they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already gone a while, she had not raised enough money, so she promised that she would only ask if she was able to raise $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they believe I get a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she was not going to run for election anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and aim at the smokers instead of the delegates, and anger at the gender discrimination, that she took the bait, that
"You would think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said of how the press reacted when she branched out.
"You would think Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my gravestone?
"She's fine?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening ointments in the U.S.-China trade war were eye-opening, and while the battle continued, a rift between the two countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump shot first this year at taxing important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which effectively means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken a stand and set tariffs on between five and ten percent of U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States for every shot they fire off, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not going to succumb to the first.
To get Washington to quit, China must do as the United States will, but bowing to the United States is too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, the U.S. pressure can have a positive effect on Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make both economies go under is more dangerous than people have dared to admit before," said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, and ask for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are progressing.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to regain normal areas.
All arrangements are now in place for refugees to be able to return voluntarily to the country they had to travel in from the ground of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond daily life and livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government is willing to take on aid to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that they will not accept assistance or assistance with terms from countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe secures say in Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup when they defeated the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost to European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown in the team of the Danish captain, Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, reaching the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, defeated most of the tournament, beating the ball in the water from the tee at hole 16, pair 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of four players who have ever won 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5&4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest ranking, became 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has participated in eight Ryder Cups, became the most-winning European with 25.5 points in his career.
"Usually I didn't cry, but today I can't help it.
It has been a tough year.
So grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European winner.
He passes the baton to compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in Sunday's singles game.
"I feel a tremendous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at him," Rahm said (23).
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now has a merit list of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup up through his career.
A strange statistic from one of the world's best players, who has won 14 major titles and is only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the fairway throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the U.S. captain, stated after a disappointing showing from his team. "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
I'm stuck.
Hats off to Thomas.
He is a single-handed captain
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA in America and our committee for the Ryder Cup and get on with it.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We were playing rounds."
