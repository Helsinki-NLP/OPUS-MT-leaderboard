Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that "they look like fools"
Among some of the members of the Assembly there has been widespread concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This has come as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly to the "Parliament of Wales".
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could trigger riots.
A member of the Labour Party assembly said his group was concerned "that this rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means "stupid" and pwp means "cat".
A member of the Welsh Party said the entire group was "unsatisfied" and had proposed an alternative.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but said there was little difference between the words "MWP" and "Budalla".
In this context, the pronunciation of the word "w" in Welsh is similar to that of the word "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to declare a name change, said: "Of course the final decision on the appointment of the Assembly members will depend on the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the tag to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a consultation with the public, and the latter's proposal to appoint the assembly as the "Parliament of Wales" found broad support.
Regarding the issue of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission favoured the appointment of "Members of the Parliament of Wales" or "WMP", but the alternative "MWP" found more support in a consultation with the public.
Members of the Assembly seem to be suggesting alternative choices, but the fight for consensus can turn into a headwind for President Elin Jones, who is expected to introduce legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly functions, including rules on the exclusion of Assembly members and the structure of the committee system.
During the discussion of the legislation, the final vote on the issue of their appointment will remain with the Members of the Assembly.
The Macedonian people voted in the referendum to change the name of the country.
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote by the people was set in an effort to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim over its territory and has consistently opposed its requests for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change referendum, has said he will not recognize the votes.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to be paid for membership in the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells fall silent, as churches in Harlem face difficulties
"Historically, the elderly people I've talked to say there's been a bar and a church in every corner," Adams said.
"They're both missing today."
He said that the disappearance of the colors is understandable.
“These days, people are socializing in other ways,” he says.
"Bars are no longer the meeting point of the neighborhood, where people go regularly."
As for the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of the properties will not last as long as the leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential palaces full of people who would not support the holy places that have remained in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy residential environments in these palaces are white," he said, "so very soon the days will come when these churches close once they are good, as it is payable for most people who settle in these homes to become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of people of color - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Congregation of White Methodists was transferred in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a congregation of people of color, who had their place of worship nearby.
St. Martin passed a congregation of people of color under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of minority traders on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, which did not accept to hire or promote people of color.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but after Father Johnson's familialists made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the quarry.
Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the quarry "the camp of the poor."
The expert who played in the career in July called it something completely different: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that this was the first career in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to a larger career at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin had not replaced him.
The events of recent months in St. Martin have been a complicated account of architects and contractors, some sent by lay church leaders and others from the episcopal diocese.
The council - the leading body of the family, made up of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July, with concern that it "will try to transfer costs" to the family council, despite the latter not being involved in the hiring of architects and contractors.
Some celebrities complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The 13-year-old shark was injured during a dive to catch gulls in California.
A shark has attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy as he was diving to catch guinea pigs in California on the opening day of the guinea pigs season, officials say.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with some friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he had heard the boy screaming for help, and then had driven towards him along with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said he had initially thought the boy was simply exasperated by the capture of some misbehavior, but then "I realized he was yelling 'Fuck me!
"Shut me up!"
Hammel says that when he reached the boy, he didn't see that his whole keyboard was healed.
"I cried out to everyone coming out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the children's hospital "Rady's" in San Diego, where he was declared in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Coast Guard captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but was identified as a harmless species of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the body.
Officials blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for hemorrhaging and security purposes.
Giles is said to have over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK's cosmetic market
Sainsbury's is competing Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with large store-style cosmetics, with a specialized sales staff.
As part of a significant effort to enter the UK's 2.8 billion pound cosmetic market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion apparel and home furnishings are falling, the biggest cosmetic sneezes will be tested in 11 stores across the country.
Investing in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelf spaces they once used for televisions, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double its range of cosmetic products to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Even existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be given more space, with areas dedicated to respective brands, similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
Also, the supermarket will re-launch its boutique cosmetics line, so that the bulk of the products are vegan - something that is increasingly being sought after by younger age buyers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer "Fragrance Shop" will be testing concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, while a second is expected to open later this year in Birly Oakham.
Online shopping and a trend towards the daily purchase of small amounts of food in nearby stores mean that now supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that outlets will start to look more and more like big stores, as the supermarket network tries to fight the price drops of Aldi and Lidl with more products and services.
Sainsbury's has placed the Argos outlet in hundreds of stores and has introduced a number of Habitats since the purchase of both networks two years ago, which he says has spurred food sales and made them more profitable purchases.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to restructure its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's tested an association with Boots in the early 2000s, but the union disbanded after a debate over how to split income from pharmacies into its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business to 281 stores in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical network, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
He expressed that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial manager at Sainsbury's, said: "We've transformed the look of our cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in a specialized training staff, who will be ready to give advice.
The range of our brands is designed in such a way as to suit every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations show that we are now a luxury cosmetic destination, which makes a difference to the old way of making purchases."
Peter Jones is "disgusted" after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
"Dragons Den's star, Peter Jones, has left "scattered" after television presenter Holly Willoughby was pulled out of an 11-million-pound deal with his business dedicated to a certain lifestyle, to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of home decor and accessories "True".
The business of these two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand.
The 37-year-old "This Morning" actress turned to Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has infatuated "Dragons Den" star Peter Jones, after last-minute withdrawal from their lucrative business dedicated to a certain lifestyle - to focus on her promising new contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV".
Sources say Jones was "disgusted" when their golden television girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she "didn't have enough time" to sign up.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand and was expected to double its estimated wealth to <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, headed to Instagram to announce her departure from "True", Jones has flown outside Britain to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was undoubtedly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term future that would accompany her over the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw has left all of the people involved absolutely stagnant.
No one could believe what was happening on Thursday, it was so close to opening.
In the offices in Marlow there is a warehouse full of goods that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of "This Morning," which is among the UK's most successful stars, could cost the firm millions, due to the considerable investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and home furnishings, and to skipping meals.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as its director in March.
The pair spend the holidays together and Jones has 40 percent of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand's ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity by ITV.
Last night, a source close to Jones said, "We don't want to comment on his business issues."
"We're in love, and then we're in love."
He made a joke about the criticism he would receive from the news media because of his comment, which some would describe as "not worthy of a president", and because of the positivity associated with North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said he was imitating the voice of the news presenters.
“I didn’t give up at all.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
But the negotiations for nuclear disarmament have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, addressed world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday saying that the North sees no "responsive response" from the U.S. side to the North.
On the contrary, he said, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at keeping it under pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his meeting's speech.
"Things are going well with North Korea," he said.
"We were at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have a great relationship now."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - halting missile testing, helping to free hostages and returning home to the rest of the U.S. military.
In his speech regarding relations with Kim, he defended his unusual approach.
"It's very simple to act as President, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing toward the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-profit organizations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 percent of Lombok's population, no national disaster was declared, which constitutes a precondition for the catalysis of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it clear in many cases that they do not seek international support, so the issue is a bit challenging," Ms. Sumbang said.
While "Save the Children" is setting up a team to travel to Paul, it is not yet known for sure whether foreign staff can work on the field.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to efforts to help.
Considering the frequent earthquakes of the land that Indonesia suffers, the country remains very unprepared in the face of the wrath of nature.
While in Aceh are built anti-gun shelters, they are hard to reach in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a siren for the warning of the meeting in Paul, despite having issued a warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best conditions, travelling between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated. . . .
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is traveling to Paul, but it will take at least three days to reach the area of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has used the improvement of Indonesia's busy infrastructure as the focal point of his election campaign, and has invested generous amounts of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has worried Mr. Joko's administration, as he faces new elections to be held next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from continued sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes after the clash of Christian and Muslim groups on the streets, where hanshars, bows and arrows, and other cold weapons have been used.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge has scored a goal against Chelsea in the last minutes.
Daniel Sturridge has saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge took a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to being about 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal, while his team was losing 1-0.
He pushed the ball lightly to his left before making a blow to the far gate.
The ball flew over the area as it deflected towards the left and upper corner of the net.
The ball saved Kepa Arrizabalaga's aerial dance and ended up in the net.
"The goal was to put myself in the right position to take the ball and players like Shaq are always playing with the balls forward, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I checked the ball with a touch and I didn't think too long but just hit."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the first half, after a goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The bluff striker made a review to Mateo Kovacic during that game, before rolling near the field and sprinting to Liverpool's semi-final.
Kovacic made a quick combination in the middle.
He then gave a beautiful vertical pass that brought Hazard to the area.
Hazard passed the defence in a speed duel and with a left-handed hit scored on the second pillar, passing the ball behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia goes to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster agency said in the early hours of Sunday.
According to reports, many people have remained trapped under the rubble of buildings collapsed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo said at a news conference.
The city of Paul, with a population of more than 380,000, has been engulfed under the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman finds death from knife wound
An investigation into the murder has been announced after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
Police have called on residents of the area who have seen or heard anything to appear for evidence.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The shooting is in the early stages, but I would like to call any person who has been near John Street in Birkenhead, who may have seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
"I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured footage, to contact us as they may have information essential to our investigation," he said.
A police spokesman confirmed the victim was a native of Birkenhead and her body was found inside a bath.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew his wife arrived at the scene to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, while police have said they are notifying the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has attempted to enter his apartment, but has been informed by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he found out about the incident.
Now, residents are being notified that they will be allowed to enter their homes only after a few hours.
A police officer has been heard telling a man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman has arrived at the scene of the crime.
She repeated the words “that’s awful.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the perimeter and another van was outside.
A number of officers were positioned within the perimeter, monitoring the housing block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 by choosing the code 247 of September 30.
Cromwell statue in Parliament, the last monument to be touched by the debate on the "rewrite of history"
Its removal would be a deserved punishment for the Taliban's destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his puritanic fanatic followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "a taker" and "an effort to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "In the midst of the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure would be displayed outside Westminster Palace.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps this would be a wrongful sacrifice of Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Cromwell's excellent portrayal of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many think still deserves to be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith expressed himself for The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a defender of parliament from external pressure, which, of course, in his case, was the monarchy.
The fact that this is a fully accurate portrayal is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known individual figure who represents one side of that medal.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
Death toll rises to Chinese farmer's death
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", has been found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near a pork stall in Liupanshiu market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is getting ready to inject a swine vaccine into a stable on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is said to have travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him lifeless and discovered the door of an open pig barn there.
He said that in the stable there was a large pig with blood in his mouth.
A medical examination has confirmed that 550 pounds of pork has injured the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised," said his cousin identified with the surname "Wu," as quoted in the evening news in Guiyang.
In the footage filmed by the security camera, Yuan was seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager has reported on the evening news that the pig had been kept in isolation to prevent another attack, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of people being attacked by pigs have been noted before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig ran into a Welsh farmer behind his tractor, while his wife drove the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was killed by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "stimulant".
"They just want to play.
They're like a very shy little girl... their goal isn't to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right respect," he said.
The aftermath of Hurricane Rosa is expected to bring large, wide-spread rains to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, the power of Hurricane Rosa is fading as it moves in the direction of the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, over the next few days, Rosa will cause rain as a result of flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
On Sunday, at 5 a.m. Eastern Time, Rosa was accompanied by winds at 85 miles per hour, categorized as Category 1 hurricane, and was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form an area of low atmospheric pressure, which is moving towards the East, towards the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa is expected to approach the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the treatment of a tropical rainstorm, the U.S.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 10 inches of debris in parts of Mexico.
Next, the interaction of tropical humidity with the low-pressure atmospheric zone will cause heavy rainfall over the next few days with wide-spread rainfall in the Southwest.
At the local level, rain showers with a height of 1 to 4 inches will cause immediate flooding, waste streams and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical high humidity will cause the rate of rainfall in certain areas to reach approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in some parts of Nevada and southern Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain is predicted in some areas of the Southwest, mostly over a large portion of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of immediate flooding with rapid deterioration of the conditions, due to the scattered nature of the tropical rains.
Due to the risk of tropical rain, it is not advisable to behave in the desert on foot.
Large streams can turn the canyons into powerful rivers, and the straits will bring strong winds and dust storms into the area.
Fearing the area's low atmospheric pressure will bring heavy rainfall in parts of California's southern coast.
The total level of waste can reach over half an inch, which can cause small spills of waste and slippery roads.
For the region, these will be the first shoots of the season.
Some scattered streams of tropical rain will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain showers spread more widely on Monday and Tuesday evening.
The strong winds will spread across all four sides on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October in the U.S. can be characterized by high temperature fluctuations, with temperatures dropping in the Arctic, while the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes, this leads to drastic changes in temperature at short distances.
A good example is the drastic temperature difference across the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remaining heat of the summer will try to accumulate and expand again.
A good portion of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to start October with warm temperatures, with an average of 80, from the Southern Fields to certain parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, a temperature that would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows high chances of temperatures above the average in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have attended Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people have followed through six television networks the interesting testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that is suspected to have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political blockade continued, and broadcasters halted regular programs to broadcast the final minute of Friday's events: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and had tried to get away at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a fiery testimony, stated that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
The number of followers is likely to have been higher than that of 20.4 million people, reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was doing average viewership measurements on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.
The figures for other broadcasting networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting viewers from the office.
To put this figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football elimination or that of the Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose critics have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led other networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest continued to be high even after the end of the trial.
Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he grinned at the protesters' cries as he tried to hop on the elevator to go to the Senate House of Representatives.
In CNN's live broadcast, he appeared standing with his eyes down for a few minutes while being warned.
"I'm standing here, stand in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He said to him, "You have the power, while there are so many helpless women."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said he would have more to say during the committee session.
A few hours later, all cable and satellite networks were directly covering the moment when the Judiciary Committee would vote on Kavanaugh's passing of the candidacy for a vote before all members of the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so with the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate over the next week, as demanded by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
Flake's election was smart, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has called for an investigation by the FBI into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and compromising national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the newspaper's front page, former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued the attack on her Brexit plan, the so-called "Chequers", saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU levy taxes on the accounts of the "unaccounted for" is "unaccounted for."
The murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and questioned in prison settings on the charge of murder without notice, the Baton Rouge Police Directorate said in a statement.
Official sources have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims had lost his glasses during the clash.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found traces of Simpson's DNA in them, CBS' WAFB subsidiary reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had admitted to firing a gun at Wayde, causing the death.
The amount for his release is set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
Baton Rouge's Eastern Municipality's Legal Doctor's office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department thanks the efforts of the fugitives at Louisiana State Police, the state police's forensics lab, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area, for helping with the investigations that led to the arrest of the author.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva has thanked the area's law enforcement authorities for "their determination and for bringing justice to the country."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-six-inch boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, had also played basketball for LSU.
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 hits per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "sad" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"We're worried about this all the time," Wade said.
Volcanic rocks over Mexico City
The hail from the Popcatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was resuscitated and 183 gas discharges were recorded within 24 hours.
The center had monitored a number of seizures and seizures.
Images on social media showed layers of ashes that had covered the car's windows in some parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in volcanic activity, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with peacekeepers, while thousands themselves joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote for a break-up.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by peaceful police forces, hit with eggs and powder paint creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that usually swallow from tourists.
Later in the day, there were also scuffles, while the police had to use rubber sticks to end the clashes.
For a few hours in a row, repeating the slogan "We do not forget, we do not forgive", pro-independence groups faced the Unionist protesters shouting "The Roof of Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local press reports.
In the region where feelings of independence prevail, tensions continue to remain high one year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is hailed by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite the fact that the turnout was low, as citizens opposed to the break-up boycotted the votes.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting through polling stations in the region through violent clashes.
On Friday evening, pro-independence groups set up camps outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The protest continued, but was forced to take another course.
Narciss Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protest along with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalonia would gain independence in the future.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out for joy that they would have the opportunity to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite the fact that in last December's local elections they achieved a vital victory, although with a close result, the Catalan pro-independence parties have had a hard time keeping the hovin this year, as many of their most well-known leaders either voluntarily and voluntarily moved away from the country or are incarcerated and imprisoned in prison.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone in police assistance, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians from both sides.
"The situation is becoming increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison awaiting trial since last year, said he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"The casting of the candidacy for the European elections is the best way to oppose the regress of democratic values and the pressure we have been subjected to by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Some arrested after car collides with home
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car collided several times with a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, around 19:30 BST.
Detective Superintendent Bob Blemmings said they had caused damage to the main gate and the apartment itself.
It is believed that at some point a bullet was thrown in the direction of the car.
Menga's batting excuses Livingston for a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
The team coming from a category below, Livingston surprised the Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard to lose second in 18 games as the team's coach from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's hit proved decisive as Gary Holt's team matched Hibernian's second-place finish.
Gerrard's team has not yet won an off-field meeting in the Premiership, this season and next Sunday, will face Hearts, the difference with which there are eight points.
But before that, the Rangers will be waiting at Rapid Vienna's home in the UEFA Europa League match on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended the series of consecutive wins in six meetings, and coach Holt has not yet experienced the loss since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses cases in front of undefeated opponents
Holt's team should have gone to the advantage many minutes before they scored, as their direct attacks caused Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but hit poorly at the gate, while then Alan Lithgow hit out in the top jump after a pass given by Craig Halkett.
The locals were willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause problems in standard hits.
And that's how the goal scored the meeting.
Rangers caused a penalty kick and Livingston created the space. Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined creating the Menga opportunity, which hit and scored in the center of the area.
By that time, Rangers had dominated the ball but the local defense had turned out to be unstoppable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had hardly ever been put to the test.
This style of play continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a wait.
Scott Pittman's kick was stopped on foot by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor as Lithgow kicked out of another standard Livingston kick.
The investigations came continuously to the Livingston area and were constantly cleared, while two claims to the penalty - after Halkett's intervention to the player who came in as substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for touch by hand - were not taken into consideration.
The game "Fenomenale" from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
For one man, they played brilliantly and continued to exceed expectations in this growing trajectory.
The style of the game and their team hasn't changed much since their return to the top, but a big credit goes to Holt for how he has electrified the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was exceptional, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in trouble throughout the match.
However, the Rangers lacked the inspiration.
Although in some cases they have played very well under Gerrard's direction, they lacked quality.
The final pass was missing - only once they managed to pass the opposing defense - and that's something that should serve as an alarm for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an is looking forward to his dream in Cologne.
Saturday (September 29th) was characterized by a blue sky smile as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aimed to regulate the relations between NATO allies.
They have fallen in opposition to issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's membership in the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then headed to Cologne to open a giant new glass.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police have banned the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters have taken to the streets to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurds - also raised their voices to condemn both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
Opposite protests reflect the divisive ability of a visitor adored as a hero by some of Germany's Turks and despised as autocrats by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwoord Street with Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m. BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the aid workers quickly arrived, but the victim died on the spot.
The collision came months after another cyclist lost his life in an accident where the author left the scene, which took place on Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash site on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the person and to inform his family members.
The roads have been closed and buses have been announced to use other roads, while drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers wounded during a riot
Six prison officers were injured during a riot in a high-security men's prison, the prison's office said.
The rebellion broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday, and continues.
Tornado specialist officers have been called in to keep control of the unrest, which included eight inmates and which are confined within one side of the prison.
Officers have been treated at the scene for some minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "The prison staff with specialized training has been mobilized to keep the incident currently under control at HMP Long Lartin under control.
Six members of staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate the violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that the persons responsible will be referred to the police and may receive extended prison sentences.”
HMP Long Martin is home to over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had been treated in hospital after an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October of last year, peacekeepers were called to jail to keep a serious situation under control, where staff were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate flooding (which can be an advantage for areas with droughts)
Although it rarely happens that a tropical depression hits Arizona, it is likely that this is exactly what will happen in the first days of next week, as the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa passes through the Southwest desert, spreading the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for immediate flooding for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Las Vegas.
Rosa is expected to take the lead for Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday's rush hour with rain showers.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have taken the status of a storm or tropical depression within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches on Arizona's Mogollon border.
In other areas of the desert in the Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, rainfall is expected to be at levels 1 to 2 inches, while in isolated areas their total can reach 4 inches.
For areas beyond the risk of immediate flooding, Rosa's rains could be a blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some of these reefs may be useful, as the South-West is currently facing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, just over 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme second-class droughts,” weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa is set to strike Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, still in hurricane power on Sunday morning, with winds of up to 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is battling cold waters over the Pacific Ocean, and as a result, it is losing power.
As a result, hurricanes are expected to hit Mexico by storm in the afternoon or on Monday evening.
Rainfalls over some areas of Mexico may be strong, posing a significant risk of flooding.
"Rainfalls of an average level of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to the northwestern Sonora, and can reach up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico, in the midst of a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching southern Utah.
"The main risk expected from Rosa or its consequences is the strong rainfall in Baja California, in the northwestern Sonora and in the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause immediate flooding with risks to life, waste streams in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for killings left in the attempt
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of remaining in the attempt after a 16-year-old with a knife was injured in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was escorted to the hospital, where he is currently in a "stable" condition.
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials have called for a presentation to anyone who may have captured video footage of the event by mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh "is faced with the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and cruel tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "is faced with the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party during the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a testimony during the hearing regarding her accusation.
On Saturday, the President said that on that day "the American people witnessed the greatness, qualities of character and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most thoughtful lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a clean public service record," he said in front of a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president briefly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment during the speech on the importance of Republican participation in the upcoming elections.
"Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
"I'm not going to vote, but I'm going to vote," he said.
"That's why I'm making so much effort and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats have as their mission to make “block resistance.”
The Senate's first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP chief's assistant told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, while the numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were hit by giant waves crashing on the beaches, when Indonesia's Sulawesi island was hit by an earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves as high as six meters (18 feet) collided on the beach in the mosg, trying to cause the deaths of many people and destroying everything went forward.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"Yesterday, when the threat of cunam was born, people were still carrying out their usual activities on the beach, and as a result did not immediately run and fell victim to it," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian paramilitary agency, told a news conference.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it took cars, trenches, homes, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed the tree to save the cunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Peru.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, crumbling and collapsed bridges, and a glass surrounded by water.
The quakes after the quake continued to shock the coastal city on Saturday.
The quake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by Friday's massive earthquake was about three times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic position of the city, which is at the edge of a long, narrow breast, may have multiplied the power of cognition, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "big bricks" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the bodies were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had disappeared.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and the scale of damage could be much higher along the 300-km (190-mile) coastline north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications networks "discontinued completely without any warning" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
That area has over 300,000 inhabitants," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were traveling to the affected areas.
"This has already turned into a tragedy, but the situation could get even worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not giving notice of Paul's hit by the tsunami, despite officials saying the waves had come at the time the warning was given.
In amateur videos distributed on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard warning passers-by on the way down for the arrival of the encounter with furious screams.
Within minutes, a wave collided on the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters did not immediately verify the authenticity of the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage, which cut off communications around Paul, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by the authorities.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated people continue to have major food needs and other basic needs.
The city's airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is more than 800.
The situation is quite severe.
While World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived without problems in the city of Palu, where workers are sheltering in the tarpaulin shelter in their office yard, they witnessed the scene of destruction along the way, Doseba said.
"They confessed to me that they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is quite severe.
Although aid groups began serious efforts to put humanitarian aid mechanisms in motion, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were being prevented from traveling to Paul's place.
Under Indonesian rules, funding, supplies and outside staff can only begin to circulate if the disaster zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the regional level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says ‘O.K., this is a national disaster,’ we can ask for national help, but this status has not yet been granted.”
On the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Paul, the friends and families of the missing persons still had hope that their loved ones' case would be one of the few miracles that ever happen in the event of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of a well.
On Saturday, the rescue forces released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of Indonesia's national paratrooper team, had trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which closed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the other people who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As an old professional in the field of parasitism, I’m very emotionally charged,” he said.
Gendon recalls that in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel between the parachutist community, he had been desperately trying to write on WhatsApp to competitors from Paul, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, his messages ended up with only one gradation mark in gray, instead of the two marks in blue.
"I think that means the messages weren't sent," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during the refueling of a ATM in Newport in Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Directorate on Friday morning, some thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee, who was reimbursing a ATM in Newport, Levee.
The driver of the vehicle had been emptying a ATM in an entertainment center and was trying to distribute more money, Detective Dennis said in a statement.
While he was busy with work, someone "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses had seen several suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
He posted the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "Officially known as Kanye West".
The 41-year-old West has long been called to Ye's nickname, and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came just before his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande at the show, which cannot come for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current name of art, West has in the past expressed that the word has a religious meaning to it.
"I think 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, speaking about the title of his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
"It's you, it's me, it's us.
I went from Kanye, which means "the only one", to simply "Ye", which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, has done what he did with or without a separate visa and capital letter.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed to never use military force against civilians, as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed to "never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, army troops opened fire on peaceful demonstrators in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were taking the lead across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving students monthly grants and opening more public universities free of charge.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education are pushing young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the amount spent on research in the field, said investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government announced discoveries of artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the U.S. lacks an official overall strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plan last year: by 2030, it aims to take the first place for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
"The doubling of the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, as other countries are still very much behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next big discovery in this field," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence being made in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book titled “The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order,” which was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he created an artificial intelligence system that he passed to the leading American player at Othello, and then worked as executive director at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's branch in China.
Lee welcomed the previous U.S. government's competition for technology, such as the Agency's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects in the Defense Field, and asked when the next competition would be held, in order to help in identifying new recruits.
Lee said that often, researchers in the U.S. need to work hard to get grants from the government.
"It's not China that's taking academic leaders away; it's corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed bright minds from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said the changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be given automatically to people with a doctorate in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
The National Foundation for Nature Sciences in China provides funding for individuals in academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding for American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Meanwhile, this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called "AI Next".
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year for research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at setting up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been implemented in months.
Macedonian voters vote in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum to decide whether its name will be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that could resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which had blocked its efforts in Europe.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes that its northern neighbor's name constitutes a claim over its territory, and has decided to veto its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change could compromise the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavs of Macedonia's population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether participation in the election will reach the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot reads: "Are you ready to join NATO and the EU through the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia, this is a price that is worth paying to achieve membership in structures such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding power, a sufficient number of members of parliament have expressed that they will abide by the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported until 1 a.m. in the afternoon.
However, voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections of 2016, where 66 per cent of registered voters cast their votes.
"I came to vote for my children, we have our country in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote in the referendum on Macedonia's name change, which will open the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scene and was placing chairs in front of the tents erected by the boycotters of the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not entering from the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be pro, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are pro-EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said a positive outcome would “confirm our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, about 30 to 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum - a figure below the required level of participation.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian television Telma, found that 57 percent of the participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent expressed that they would vote pro.
For a successful referendum, the turnout rate should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would give it the first strong blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes through all of Brighton's defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling faced all of Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute look extremely easy.
The Argentinian fighter took a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the action.
He made his way through Brighton's three defenders before going out on the open field.
Later, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green blouses.
He overstepped a defender and quickly passed on to several others at the entrance to the Brighton area.
He then went to the left where Sterling was.
The English striker used his exit into the area to chase the ball Agueros, who struck with the right and crossed the goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by throwing the ball in the right corner of the net.
"Aguero is suffering from a foot problem," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about how he would play for 55 or 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League match.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball to Brighton's semi-final.
He did a great job with Laroy Sane on his left arm.
Sane advanced a few steps before passing towards Sterling on the second pillar.
The blue attacker took the ball to the net and then slipped out of the boundary lines.
City will face Hofenheim in the qualifying round of the Champions League group stage on Thursday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to retain the role of the "princes" against the Rockies
With Nationals eliminated from the chance to reach the eliminators, there was no reason to impose another start.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given the opportunity to score against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a playoff opportunity for the Rockies, who have an advantage with a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rockies reached at least one playoff opportunity thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to win the division title.
"Although we're playing without any motive, at least we can score by recognizing the atmosphere of the fans here in Denver but also the fact that the opposing team will play at the highest level against which we can face all year round.
"Why wouldn't I want to play in a game like that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the headlines on Sunday, but are reported to be willing to leave Scherzer in such a situation to start the meeting.
Scherzer, for whom the 34th would be the headline, held a training session on Thursday and could appear on the pitch on Sunday, which could be a normal day off for him.
The player from Washington, who shot to the right is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts at 220 2/3 of the shots this season.
Trump meets with West Virginia at a rally
The president referred briefly to the situation regarding his High Court choice, Brett Kavanaugh, before talking about the importance of Republicans' participation in the midterm elections.
"It's a decision for everything we've done so far.
Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices of our lives.
"This is one of the biggest choices -- I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so hard to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible group of radical democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they have divided the mind to regain power in any way, you see the humiliation of their stupidity.
They do not want to know who is hurting them, who is pushing on their feet to take power and control. That is what they want, power and control, but we will not give them."
The Democrats, he said, have as their mission to make "block resistance".
"And you've seen this in the last few days," he said, calling the Democrats "innocent, mean, fucking and unfaithful."
He was referred to as the Democratic Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, which sparked dissatisfaction from the audience.
"Do you remember her response?"
Do you want to expand the document?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, uh, no, I... wait a little... - her body language was pretty bad - it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer an "open church".
She is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted for the motion of disbelief in me, they didn't live up to it.
After all, I'm not the first of the Labour Party MPs who are said to be unwelcome - all because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way, simply because he resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of disbelief was a criticism of me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Relating to the importance of a responsible economic policy, relating to national security and to Europe, ironically similar issues for which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Labour Party's meeting in Nottingham East, it was said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight-year term as a local Labour MP, the GC meetings have been like that.
Unfortunately, the meetings no longer have their previous tone, and the promise of a "softer and more kinder" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever existed.
It has become increasingly apparent that the opposite views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and any opinion is judged on the basis of its admissibility by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues with whom I thought sharing similar political views began to claim that I would take a 180-degree turn and hold positions with which I would never have agreed - whether on national security alone or on the apocalyptic trinity.
Every time I speak in public - no matter what I say - the criticisms on social media, with people seeking my discharge, denounce the policies of the center, tell me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it wasn't just me who suffered.
I am aware that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments about me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face gender and racial discrimination every day, but do not tolerate it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of the levels of violence.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party must nurture a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer an "open church", and with every motion of faith and with every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly closed.
Over the past two years, I have often been advised to cut my head off, not to be so loud, and that everything "will be fine."
That's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, driven by the disrespect of Thatcher's government that led my class to failure in a general school, I've tried to lobby for better public services for those who need it more locally.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had my political stances and points of opposition to the current leadership.
For all those who voted for the motion on Friday, I just want to say that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will affect our families, businesses and public services. I fail to understand the desire to spend time and energy with my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether or not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to be at your service and I promise you that no threat to discharge or political favor will stop me from acting in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible Ayr tops the list
The two late attempts may have somewhat changed the final result, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in today's extremely entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Now they're leading the list as the only undefeated team out of ten teams.
In the end, it was their wonderful defense and the courage to take risks that ensured the victory of the local team, and coach Peter Murchie was completely right to be satisfied.
"We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still unbeatable, so I'm normally happy," he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said: “We want to congratulate the Ayr team, who took more risks than we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, scored by Frazier Climo, passed Ayr to the advantage, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who came for this challenge from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to show off a number one top scorer and Baggy's top scorer.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage with a penalty while just before the end of the first half, he scored and scored an individual action leading the score to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose made a good start to the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, returned to goal by Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Later, there was a long interruption as a result of the severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left with a barrel, and after the game's restart, Ayr increased the result through an attempt by Stafford McDowall, scored by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was later penalized with yellow cards, and Melrose again took advantage of the fact that they had one more player, with a goal-scoring attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a tough-waiting game.
However, the locals returned and when Struan Hutchinson was punished with yellow card because he prevented Climo, without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made a "touch down", behind Ayr's three-legged back that was advancing forward.
Climo scored and did the same almost after the restart of the game, after Kyle Rowe caught the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and led forward striker Gregor Henry, for the fifth try of the local team.
The "Still Game" star seems set for a new career in the restaurant industry
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems determined to enter the hotel industry after it was discovered that he has been appointed director of a licensed chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's famous show, with fellow screenwriter and co-starring his long-time partner in the world of comedy, Greg Hemphill.
The pair have announced that the ninth season will be the last for this show, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source for the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to get into Glasgow's "flowering restaurant industry."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without going out to sea hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling an improvisation of the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised the flag of the blue ocean.
At sea bases from Lake Titicaca in the Amazon is marked with the motto: "The sea is our property.
His recovery is a duty."
Across Bolivia without going out to sea, the memory of taking the coast from Chile in a bloody conflict for resources during the 19th century is still quite alive - as is the desire to once again sail across the Pacific Ocean.
Now, these hopes are much more likely than they have ever been for decades, while on October 1, Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice after a five-year review.
“Bolivia is characterised by the hustle and bustle of unity and calmness, and of course, it is waiting with positivity for the result,” said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the GJND session on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia that - after decades of disorderly discussions - Chile is forced to hold talks to deliver to a neighbouring Bolivia.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for a second term in next year's election - Monday's decision is quite important.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts are of the opinion that there is very little chance that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia - and that even if, they would change very little.
The U.N. body based in the Netherlands does not have the tag to give a country another part of Chile's territory, and has said it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the GJND is making a decision just six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the issue "was not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of helping the Bolivian cause, the events of the last four years may have penalized it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been compromised by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has vanished every trace of kindness left to the Chileans, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, opposed the idea that the court's decision was strangely quick.
Monday will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to put an end to 139-year-old disagreements, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue for political interests.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to understand that we should leave it behind the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't be carried out as long as it can't trust the U.S.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never first carry out nuclear disarmament, as long as it can't trust Washington.
Young was holding a speech on Saturday in front of the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore among leaders of rival states.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of a revival of nuclear diplomacy so far "overwhelmed", rather than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, the hopes that the U.S.'s continued sanctions and opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will make North Korea knee-deep, are empty hopes.
As long as Pyongyang does not act first to make significant moves to disrupt, Washington hesitates to accept the statement.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's intention to withdraw its arsenal, which the state most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of giant hats, which will soon come on the streets of your city
If you want to enrich your hat collection or provide complete protection from the sun's rays, don't look any further.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of strange giant hats for their SS19 collection on the runway, which left open-mouthed all the stylists at Paris Fashion Week.
The highly impractical chapels have been given on Instagram this summer, and these stylists have put their amazing creations on the stage.
Valentino's special creation was a very extravagant bearded hat, adorned with a wide shelter with details similar to the dolls, which surrounded the model's head.
Other great accessories included stone-furnished shawls, a magic hat and even a pineapple - but they aren't made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks - together in time for Hallouin.
Many of the colored masks had torn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creature resembled diving gear, complemented by the air pipe and water glasses, while the other resembled a shell with melted ice.
And if you like to follow this bold fashion - you're in luck.
Fashion analysts predict that giant hats may soon come on the streets of your city.
The trend of the giant hats has followed that of "La Bomba", the hat of the castle with the two-legged shelter, which we've all seen, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that hides behind the highly impractical hat that he received on social media brought out another big creation on the sidewalk - a beach bag of cashews, almost as big as the model with the clothes he was wearing.
The light-colored orange raffle bag, with a sharp raffle and a white leather handle at the top, was the most distinctive creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Famed personality stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer I expect to see a cape and giant beach bag on the streets of cities - as the stylist has left such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demands for large accessories."
John Edward: Essential Linguistic Skills for Global Citizens
Private schools in Scotland hold the record for academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent results in exams, further reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), are trying to offer the highest level of service to students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education at the highest levels, for their chosen career and their country as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a customized educational curriculum, we are proving how the branch of modern languages continues to be a widespread and popular choice across schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, your words go to their ears.
If you speak to him in your own language, your words go to the heart.”
These words are a powerful reminder that we can't rely only on English when we want to build relationships with people from foreign countries.
From the results of this year's recent tests, we can see that languages are leading the list of results, with the highest level of passing grades among private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have received the maximum grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students had received the maximum grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied French.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed for children and young people in the future.
Currently, the branch of foreign languages is considered as important as the branches of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of private schools and beyond.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that among the main difficulties faced by employers in filling out vacancies, 17 percent of them were related to the lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for the preparation of young people for their future careers.
With the addition of workplaces that have the condition of mastering foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future, as the owner of such a long-term ability.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign people will automatically position a multilingual person over the competitors.
According to a YouGov poll, which included more than 4,000 adults from the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to develop a conversation, and French was the only foreign language to speak 2 languages.
That's why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
The mastering of many languages, especially the mastering of the languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages that are taught in them.
Some schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will offer languages that are considered to be most important for the UK in the 2020 outlook, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a range of languages you can choose from in private schools, with educational staff composed of field specialists.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a school environment that will prepare children and "arm them" with the skills they need to get out of it, regardless of the future.
At this time it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be regarded as “the ability of international communication.”
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron is expected to debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who were waiting to see LeBron James in his first game for the Log Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the pre-season opener on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
I don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers correspondent wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season program.
"I don't need the pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump's time of gatherings in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump began a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of five such gatherings planned to be held next week, including stops in friendly areas that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of approval hanging on his election to fill the vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to create support for future elections as Republicans run the risk of losing control in Congress when voting in the month of May.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia today and how to follow him online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to be held at 7 p.m. Eastern Time today evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's rally in West Virginia online below, via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings at the High Court of Candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense over allegations of his sexual misconduct, with the Senate's expected confirmation vote pending for a week-long follow-up to the FBI.
But the primary goal of these multiple gatherings is to help Republicans take a stand in the run-up to the November election.
Trump's campaign staff said the five gatherings next week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to his agenda that the President will travel to as many countries as possible as we head for the campaign's upcoming season," a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters.
Planned to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could bring support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia's Metro News Agency.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the country where he won by more than 40 points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senate Republican candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been left behind according to polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a boost in polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team showed readiness to fight as they keep their hopes alive by heading to kick-offs on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, the remaining quarterback for Sunday afternoon, may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
This buzz of buzz, is a totally created sports concept, but a concept where players truly believe and never more than in such competitions.
Where can we say that we're feeling this now?
"They had a six-point gap that has now gone into four, so we can say that it's been created to some extent some sort of vulture I believe," Jordan Spieth said as he closed the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage with four points ahead, while remaining in the game and twelve points.
As Spieth states, Americans hope the odds are in their favor and have a lot to encourage, especially from the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and got three of the four possible points.
Spieth has been relentless since the start of the shoots to the pit and is leading by giving his example.
The party rosters were added as the round went on, introducing the golf ball with an easy hit to bring the match to a draw, when he and Thomas were previously two points down after two rounds.
His easy language that gave them the victory of the match in the 15th hole was expected with a similar nickname, which shows that he believes the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You just have to work hard and worry about your game," Spieth said.
All the players are gone now.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple has achieved four out of four and can't go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't catch a shot over the minimum on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the shots over the minimum on Sunday morning, Friday evening and at nine second shots on Friday morning.
This result and the way in which they seem to flow their energy towards the enthusiastic crowd and vice versa reinforces the idea that they are the players to beat Sunday and that there will be no other player better known than Fleetwood and Molinari to score a possible victory for the Europeans.
Possibly both at the same time in different pits.
However, the declarations of a European triumph are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson left him very easily with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourth game of the morning, when he fell in love with Alex Noren.
One point above the minimum and two to nine seconds ahead put the Spaniard and the Swedish in a pit from which they had no chance of getting out any more.
However, on Sunday no one will be there to help you get out of your hole.
The fourth and pairing games are so amazing to follow closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change there for them.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead to the finals, but these four sessions also showed that the U.S. team will still compete even though some people, especially Stateside, have questioned this.
Europe leads 10-6 as it heads towards the Ryder Cup final day
Europe has a significant advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of the fourth and doubles games with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
Inspiring duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two wins against a Tiger Woods in difficulty to increase their lead to four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, offered to win the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over the powerless American team in the morning doubles, leading to a 3-1 series of results.
The U.S. team showed more resistance in the fourth game, winning two games, but they couldn't reduce the difference.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starting player to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed 'Molliwood', after a sensational weekend are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four open matches.
After throwing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourth game, they combined quite well together to defeat a powerless Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more dramatic 5&4 result.
Woods, who had a hard time holding two meetings on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of greatness, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 games in the fourth game and with couples and 7 games in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for the fourth game of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the doubles game and took a 2&1 loss from Dustin Justin and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe didn't have everything in favor on a pretty beautiful and fresh day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time professional winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the difference that Americans should have caught by two points on Saturday.
They took a bold 2&1 win against Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourth games and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the doubles after losing in the first two pits.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has turned the result after a four-point difference in individual games, although Furyk's holding team needs only one equalization to hold the trophy.
However, since he was the second best player for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems to go beyond their chances.
North Korea says it won’t be unilaterally “caught” without gaining trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that sanctions continued on Saturday were deepening distrust of the United States and the country would not in any way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
New Yong Ho told the annual body from around the world of the General Assembly that North Korea has undertaken "significant measures that show good will" in the past year, such as the ban on nuclear and missile tests, dismantling of areas where nuclear and nuclear tests were carried out and landing nuclear tests.
"However, we are not seeing any response to this from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, our national security will have no self-confidence, and under these circumstances there is no way that we will unravel ourselves first."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's usual complaints about Washington's resistance to a separate "phase-in" approach to the nuclear disarmament process where North Korea would be evaluated because of the gradual steps it has taken, his statement seemed to be irrelevant.
The young man was referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at a summit held for the first time between a U.S. president in office and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim vowed to work towards "nuclear disarmament" of the Korean peninsula's disputed peninsula.
North Korea has called for an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that the Pentagon must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international tough sanctions on North Korea, the report said.
"The U.S. insists that nuclear disarmament be carried out initially and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a mandatory manner, even by opposing the declaration of the end of the war," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can knee us are dreams in the sun of people who are uninformed about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is deepening our distrust."
Young did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement the U.S. leader made earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister underscored three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the party in the matter of nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the US, the process of nuclear disarmament would not situate at this dock."
Despite this, the tone used in the new speech, was profoundly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly, that placing U.S. territory under the target with North Korean missiles was inevitable after "Mr. President the Devil" Trump called a "Mr. Trump the Devil"
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, thanked Kim for the courage shown in taking steps to crack down, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that the sanctions should not continue.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeline for it, saying "If it's going to take two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council's sanctions must continue vigorously and unhindered until full and thorough verification is carried out."
The Security Council has unanimously decided to increase sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an effort to put an end to the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Young on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Penia again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go as well.
He left Penian in July saying there had been progress, and only within a few hours North Korea denounced him for having carried out "mafia-style requests."
North Korea vowed in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile zone and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take "appropriate measures."
He said Kim had told him that the "relevant measures" he was seeking were security assurances that Trump responded to in Singapore and a move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students get lessons on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year has included all students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of ‘masks’ of study through the use of caffeine from these ‘sleepers.’
An academic noted that university students number one in the world, often don't know when it comes to the most basic things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham's and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start this course after giving a report on the impact that sleep deprivation has on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl approached me and said, 'Why is this thing being told to me now, in my last year?'
She said no one had spoken to her before about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, included in the program for the first time this year, explains to students the necessary elements of how the habits of a good sleep help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of medical services at the university, said the university decided to introduce this course after finding that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The course that lasts one hour involves a number of interoperability tasks.
On one side is a view of a convection room, where students click on the coffee cupboards, curtains, athletes and books in order to explain to them the effects of caffeine and lighting and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of showering on the bedtime routine.
In another part, participants are explained how sleep deprivation over a long period of time increases the risk of heart attack, ischemia, depression, and cancer.
A map of the camp, with an interactive icon, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know - as you have the right to know, the health impact when you choose to smoke," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride in spending ‘one night’ sleep continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that deprivation of sleep was an ever-increasing problem.
Ensuring that you’ve taken enough sleep, of a good quality, should be the students’ ‘secret weapon’ to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain, because deprivation from sleep leads the brain to a starvation mode, making them feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course after attending one of his teaching hours last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to return to a course for the whole camp.
He hopes that the next step, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining competing institutions.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should set an hour of nap time that when they should go to bed, and also that when they should wake up, and be aware of the damaging effects of ‘blue light’ coming out of the electronic screens and LED lighting, which can trigger the knee-jerk problem.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga scores against Gerrard's boys
Rangers got another hit as visitors as Dolly Menga's hit gave Steven Gerrard's broken side a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was looking to record its first win since the February 4-1 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused the second loss in 18 games to Gerrard as coach, leaving his team eight points behind the escapist Premier Hepburn.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half and with a Rangers team placement that seemed completely powerless to equalize.
As the Rangers now fall to sixth, Livingston climbs to third and is right behind Hibernian for the goal difference.
Rangers can expect to have more trouble after their winger Calum Spence was treated for a head-to-head kick after being hit by an object likely thrown by visiting fans.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, which passed Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, entered the same 11-yard field that grabbed a Hearts point last week and that he would be pleased with the way his well-organized team sank opponents in every round.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston created more when he had it in hand.
They should have scored just two minutes from the start of the meeting, when Menga's first pass Scott Pittman gave to Allan McGregor's protected gate square, was not exactly used by him to shoot the ball out.
A long cross from the penalty kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, only shot him out on the back of the gate.
Rangers took control of the game but it seemed that they hoped more than they really believed in their game in the opposing zone.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty after a four-hour game as he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson did not hear the Colombian's complaints.
Rangers managed to make two shots at the gate in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, wasn't bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head-shot and Ovie Ejaria's unforced shot.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have been against what was being seen on the pitch, no one can deny that they deserved it just for the grid they showed.
The Rangers again failed in long-distance service to Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball towards Scott Robinson, who kept quiet to pass Menga and score in a simple way.
Gerrard acted in the break between the parts as he replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and this change for a little while did not give an immediate effect as the side went on for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran out of his position to block it.
But Livingston continued to make the guests play as they like, where Lithgow and Halkett played each other's long balls from time to time.
Holt's team could extend his lead to the final stage, but McGregor stood strong and denied Jacobs before Lithgow fired out of a ball taken from the corner kick.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton later claimed during the game for another penalty, while he was confused with Jacobs, but again Thomson allowed the advantage.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger scale
And now a page from our almanac of "Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, As Today 136 years ago and IN VAZHDIM... the day when the next physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the production of what is known as the Geiger scale.
A major pillar of science since then, the Geiger scale has become a major pillar of popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film Coronado Cities, with a cast of seemingly unprofessional scientists such as Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger measurement used to track radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
"When you put these boxes in, you can really hear the effects of atoms released from radioactivity into minerals."
Evans: "Don't tell me, I'm really listening right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "distinguish" bad cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "distinguish" bad cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory.
They can ‘separate’ a protein that is found in many types of cancer and then be re-injected.
A vaccine that is being tested is showing promising results in patients who have several types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, noticed that the cancer in the ovaries disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they ‘distinguish’ a protein that is found heavily in several types of cancer called HER2, and then in the re-injection of these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show us that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovary, lung and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients "to teach" them how to detect cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West appeared at a Pro-Trump rally, wearing a cape with the MAGA inscription, after his appearance in the SNL.
It's not oil as it should be.
Kanye West was stunned by the protests in the studio during a broadcast on Saturday Night Live, following a disappointing performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After playing his third song for that night called "Ghost Town", where he was wearing a hat that wrote "Make America Great", he continued to speak out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to a white person and they say to me, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'"
"Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL launched the show with a parody starring Matt Damon, where Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, West's harsh speech recordings were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock was trying to hook up with West with that post or not.
Also, West complained to the viewers that he had spent a difficult time in the back because of what he had put in his head.
"They treated me badly in the back.
They said, ‘Don’t go on stage with that hat on your head.’
They've treated me badly!
And then they tell me I'm grounded," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said: » Do you want to see the sunset? « He said: » I put my superhuman hat on my head. This shows that no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward? «
"Try the love."
His comments received whistles at least twice from viewers and members of the SNL cast appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reports, where one person told the newspaper: "The whole studio fell silent."
West was called as a late substitute for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the song "I Love It", dressed as Perrier's bottle.
West is backed by the chairman of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "To one of the bravest souls: THE TALENT WHO HAPPENED IN THE BALL OF TOUR."
But show host Karen Hunter posted on Twitter that West was simply "being herself and that's extraordinary."
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying music or clothing or by supporting his 'art'), for whom I believe he is ashamed and who spreads the ideology that is harmful to my community.
while he is free.
That's how we are," she added.
Before the show, the singer stated on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was already "the guy who was formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and also the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.
Accusations of attempted stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.

The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecution Service.
Star in ‘Game of Thrones’, Kit Harington, Admitted Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as a swordsman in Jon Snow's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has hit the male hero's stereotype, saying that the appearance of such roles on the screen, makes young boys realize that they should behave as strong to be respected.
Speaking about “The Sunday Times Culture,” Kit said he believed “something went wrong” and was asked how the problem of toxic masculinity could be solved in the age of #MeToo movement.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in "Game of Thrones", also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt "quite important" about solving the issue.
"Personally, I feel this issue is pretty important at the moment - where have we been wrong about the appearance of masculinity?" he said.
"What have we learned from men as they grow up, about the problems we are facing now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the over-male characters appearing there.
He continued: "What is born and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and what is taught on the street, which makes young boys believe that they should behave in a certain way to feel men?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this?
"There's definitely something wrong with the kids."
During the interview, he also admitted that he would no longer shoot for "Game of Thrones" after the series ended at the end of next summer, saying "the horses and horses have come to the top of his nose."
From November, Kit will take part in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother thief.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he's ever gotten from Game of Thrones.
"In this production I found my wife, so we can say that this show gave me the next family and defined my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the sentimental interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the award-winning science-fiction series 'Emmy'.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected across the country, health authorities say.
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual intercourse, showing a change from the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people receiving the HIV virus through this way had almost gone zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people still prevails.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Most of the transmission of the disease occurs due to inadequate protective measures during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medical drugs for the treatment of HIV as part of an effort to hit the problem.
Maxine Waters denies GOP senators' data have been disseminated by staff members, says these are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theory."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced claims that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers' websites on Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were being pushed by experts and the "extreme right" online site.
"It's lies, lies, and just hateful lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information is reported to include home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators were questioned by Kavanaugh.
Some of the conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the publications were linked to the Waters office and retrieved data from a Waters staff member, Hill reports.
"This baseless claim is totally untrue and a big lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - the identity, personal information and safety of which has been compromised as a result of these false and fabricated claims - has not been in any way responsible for the flow of this information.
This baseless claim is totally false and a big lie."
Waters' statement was immediately met with online criticism, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial becomes frustrating," wrote Fleischer.
"That means she doesn't have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they shouldn't be nervous.
It shouldn't be provocative.
You don't have to question the defendant's motives.
He must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing very nervous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is contesting to take Waters' place in mid-term elections, also posted his statements on Twitter.
"It's a big case, if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had signaled "the relevant authorities and law-enforcement institutions on these false charges.
"We will make sure that the authors are discovered," she continued, "and that they take legal responsibility for all their actions, which have a devastating and dangerous effect on anyone by my staff."
Review of "Johnny English Hits Again" - a comedy with an unaccompanied spy with material by Rowan Atkinson
It is the case that in every new British-influenced film, it is seen for hidden messages related to the Brexit theme and this finds its implementation and in the revival on the stage of the comedy-action venture "Johnny English" - which has its beginnings in 2003 with "Johnny English" and with the return of 2011
Will this satirical comedy bring out how clearly incapable we are connected with the new national opportunities in the field of exports?
In any case, the character with the eye out the country, with Johnny English's face as rubbery and seemingly obnoxious, has been given permission to confuse things for a second time - his name, which shows more than anything else that he is a wide comical creature disguised for the territories where he doesn't speak.
Of course he is a missing secret agent, who despite strangely claiming to appear as a magician, has little by Inspector Clouseau, little by the character of Mr. Bean and a portion of that type who contributed only with the release of a sound in the song ‘Chariots of Lore’.
He is also based on the mystery man, traveler and international Atkinson, who once played in television commercials that are now forgotten about Barclaycard, leaving the country in chaos wherever he went.
There's one or two good moments at the premiere of this movie.
I liked it a lot when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medieval parsmora and the helix plate collided a little on his helmet.
Here appears the gift of physical comedy performed by Atkinson, but the humor seems like wax and sometimes too much, especially when ‘serious’ films like 007 and Mission Impossible have introduced a bit of comedy as ingredients in their films.
Humor seems to be directed at children more than adults and Johnny English's crippling events aren't as creative and are focused on voiceless movements, similar to what Atkinson performs in Bean's character.
The permanent theme of this film is the fact that the UK is in serious danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret network of British agents, uncovering the identity of British agents on the ground and has lured the agent into duty - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last chance for a prime minister to appear as a pompous and battle-ready figure who is already suffering from extraordinary political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best to realize the character that looks like Teresa May, but there isn't much text on the scene that she can play.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that any active spy has been compromised, so she will have to rely on someone who has retired.
And that means choosing yourself Johnny English, who was now employed as a school principal in a high-rise neighborhood, but who unofficially gave lessons on how to become a secret agent: here are beautiful scenes, because English is offering a spy academy in the form of a rock school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunites with his former assistant, multi-player Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a submarine captain, in the role of a high-ranking girl, where Vicki Pepperdine has been used a little wrong for this role.
So Batman and Robin did things all over again in His Majesty's Secret Service, they're back in action, pitting themselves against the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is enchanted by the tech-savvy billionaire who claims she can solve the problems of British computers: the Jason Volta league, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their ridiculous and outrageous odyssey: disguised as a cameraman, set the flame of a beautiful French restaurant; cause chaos as they enter the luxury yacht of Volta without permission; and English is totally confused as she tries to use the virtual reality devices to share her home.
All the sequences are usually made for the final scene, but despite being fun and noisy, the whole thing looks a bit like a children's movie.
It's pretty moderate stuff.
As in other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Isn't the British film industry a role for Rowan Atkinson that would suit his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it has a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would make the British work four days a week - but pay for five.
The party reportedly wants the bosses of companies to save by using the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for employees, giving them an extra day off.
We would see that the employees would enjoy a weekend with three days off - but by continuing to bring home the same salary.
The sources said the idea would "conform" to the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country in favor of workers.
Going through a four-day work week is an idea that has been embraced by the Congress of Trade Unions, as a way for employees to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It's not going to happen right away, but a four-day week is an aspiration that matches the party's approach to balancing the economy in favor of workers and also the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to embrace this idea, where the Green Party was previously sworn in for a week of four working days during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, at the moment this aspiration is not being supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A week with four working days is not party policy and is not being taken into account by the party."
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to gauge his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to transfer power from “anonymous directors” and “winners” to public service firms.
The Chancellor’s plans in the shadows also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back all of their shares, because the Labour government can “disappear” on the grounds of actions considered a violation.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and to create the All-Inclusive Property Funds to transfer to employees 10 percent of the capital of private sector firms, which means a dividend paid per year in the amount of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy show in "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises questions as to whether the findings of the investigation bureau could affect any Republican senator to pull back supporters.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, the 60 Minutes show's correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy appeared more open than his college from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said when I was in the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I got him on the phone after this happened, so after the allegations came out and I said, "Did you do this?"
It was clear and clear."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be stuck in stone.
"I've shared my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and the change would only make him some bomb accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she mentioned couldn't verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the "Global Citizen" Festival and has done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical performance that features a large and impressive list of stars who interpret and also have an equally impressive mission; to end poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host crowds of thousands of people at the Great Lawn in Central Park who not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to become aware of the true purpose of the show.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group, which hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to benefit from a free ticket to the show (except for the event when you want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must fulfill a number of tasks, or "actions" as a volunteer job, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other way to attend.
But how successful was the "Global Citizen" Festival when there are still 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince those seeking these interventions, or is it just another case of what's known as "click-through activism" - people who feel they're making a real change by signing a Twitter petition or posting an online petition?
Since 2011, "Global Citizen" is said to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, giving a boost to various goals.
These actions are said to have helped drive world leaders to declare $37 billion in political commitments, which are said to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 pledges and statements as a result of the group's actions, where at least $10 billion have already been distributed or secured as funds.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on about 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and implementing agencies based in the United Kingdom, committed to "encourage children to grow up with their full potential," promising to give Rwanda a fortune of $45 million.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn the social injustice of abuse into a memory of the past," The Power of Nutrition's ambassador told the crowd at a live concert in London in 2018.
The group also said that after taking 5,000 actions to call on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government declared funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, that will affect 5 million women and children who need intervention.
In response to the most frequently asked questions on their website, they asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It's going to be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we're going to fall and we're going to fail.
But as every high-minded citizen, and as the movements against apartheid before us, we will go out, for together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the actors who will perform at this year's show in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy for "blockage" to prevent Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If it's going to be necessary" Washington can rely on its Navy to prevent Russian energy from spreading across markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, according to a Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian government - is a pretext to explore for new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to supply it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to this official, there is a way to deal with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to block them, in order to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants in an activity developed by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit organization that has personified itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that these approaches are practically the same.
"The economic option over Iran and Russia is little or much the exploitation and replacement of combustibles," he said, referring to Russia as a "fake mole" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes after the Trump administration undertook a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump said had turned Berlin into a "slave" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is claimed to double the existing pipeline’s capacity to reach 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the project's fierce opposition from Washington is simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the same view that energy cannot be a tool used for pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has been opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industry organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has asked the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a lot of problems when a third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), said after a meeting recently between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously" think about running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously" think about taking part in the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a rally in the town of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the nomination.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our ruined government, and that includes putting a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will take seriously the nomination for president."
Warren hit President Donald Trump during a rally in the city, saying that he "is taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm terribly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for her criticism of Trump and his High Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "that of course before the vote we need an investigation from the FBI."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a large portion of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' "possible" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University's Political Research Center.
Thirty-two percent of the respondents supported this proposal.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick enjoyed greater support for the candidate, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent opposing the candidate.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have been discussed to compete in 2020 include former vice-president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially put in place in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites post-traumatic stress disorder of Trak Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted into the military in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
"What my son's going through, what he's going through after he's back, can connect with other families who feel the spread of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with," she told attendees at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paul called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans, "come a little changed, solidified, come to think about whether they get the proper respect from the soldiers and other members of the army, for what they've been given."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence following an assault on a woman, following a report of domestic violence and gun violence while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokeswoman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support opposition to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing a legal objection to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims who have escaped criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed an explanatory document as a friend-of-the-judge on Friday in Washington, D.C., in support of changing asylum-seeking policies, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace case against Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons members of the gang" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
It was stopped in Texas.
The state attorneys who are supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries that produce a high number of asylum seekers in the U.S. because they are countries that have widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum-seeker policy returned a decision, in 2014, by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented migrants to escape domestic violence and apply for asylum.
Colombia's District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal laws require that all requests for asylum be judged according to the facts and circumstances of the case, and such a measure runs counter to this principle," a friend-of-the-judge report said.
The lawyers further argued in the report that the ban on the entry of migrants by police hurt the U.S. economy, stating that their chances are to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary working arm."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims who are rescuing family violence and gang violence from the gangs.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious belief, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political conviction," Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Asylum is never meant to ease all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate attempt to save Paul as the death toll doubles in a race to find survivors
In the case of the survivors, the situation was very honest.
"The situation feels quite tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she held her young and sick son in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palusa.
"The ambulance takes the bodies every minute.
There is no more clean water."
The people saw them return to their ruined homes, taking their belongings out of the water, in an attempt to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake are overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has broken his spine and shoulder, were placed at the Military Hospital outside of Paula, where patients are being treated in outdoor settings due to land shocks still continuing.
His eyes were filled with tears as he remembered when he felt the violent shock of the earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that shared it with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was squeezed under the rubble of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard the woman was crying and asking for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Gangami’ With ‘Propaganda Advertising’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page ad in a daily U.S. newspaper that promoted the common benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the pay-as-you-go supplement of the China Daily on the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections held on November 6.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to increase pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to put in place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently reeling in an upward trade war that has seen a balance of tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts have said China's paying tariffs in this trade war were set to hit exporters in countries like Ioua, which has backed Trump's Republican party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor for a long time in Ioua, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad wrote that, "China is already doubling this harassment by putting propaganda advertisements in our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is being helped by the welcoming American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newsstands on the street here in Beijing, you will find very few voices against and you will see no real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese may have about China's worrying economic trajectory, as the media is under the strong control of the Communist Party," he said.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China, avoided the offer to publish his article," although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans are shifting women's suffrage ahead of midterm elections following the Kavanaugh scandal
As more prominent Republican figures stand in solidarity and defend the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, ahead of several allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will face a harsh reaction, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions on this topic have been very high, and many Republicans have publicly stated that they want to continue voting for the candidate.
These things can’t be undone,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxuell School told The Hill about an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he was suspicious of Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute effort for an investigation by the FBI and that it would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it either tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted ‘The Saint Is Coming!’ as they demonstrated in the Senate corridors as Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democrats' enthusiasm and motivation will reach the top," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People are saying it's already been at high levels; that's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among undecided female voters in the periphery and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, even though they don't like the president, usually don't vote at all."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested there would be a harsh reaction if Republicans continued to support the candidacy.
"This has become a cluttered mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether or not Kavanaugh will be placed in the defendant's bank, it's also about how Republicans have dealt with this issue and how they've treated that woman," Guy Priori told NBC News.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on who to believe in the vigilance of Ford and Kavanaugh's witnesses, with the latter having a slightly higher support.
A recent survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe them without a doubt or with a high probability of Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they believe them without a doubt or with a high probability of Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent think Kavanaugh, most likely or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford as well as by the other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports 'The Guardian'.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, under oath, that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17 while he was intoxicated.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the High Court showed his genitals in front of her while they were at a party while they were studying in Yale, in the 80's.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is creating a company that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, ‘Inrupt,’ is a company built by Berners-Lee’s open source platform, called ‘Solid’.
‘Solid’ allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal behind Inrupt was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of this innovative company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create "storage of their personal data on the network" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of things to do, music lists, and other personal and professional tools.
It's the same as having available on a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What is unique about the storage of personal data on the network is the fact that it remains entirely in the user's hands what kind of information will be accessed.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's executive director, John Bruce, is to bring together the right resources, processes and skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, several developers contracted to work on this project, and a volunteer coding community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren't talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change where all of their business models are completely flooded overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post in 'Medium' published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the network's debate of unemployment.
While founding Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the consortium of the World Wide Web, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann celebrates the dedication of the Victorian Cross during the First World War for the clergy
The only clergyman to have won a Victorian Cross during World War I as a warrior is remembered in his homeland, 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won the highest British military title.
A memorial stone was presented by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the nips, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the commemoration would be exactly 100 years from the heroic act that gave the medal to his grandfather.
According to the 'London Gazette', on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann, directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the sway of bullets from fields and machine guns."
He then rushed to the line of fire and with a "great bravery" led the battalion forward and captured one of the weapons in the field and killed only three people by opposing troops.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve but something that really looks modest."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set up a post-paradise choir, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth group.
Michael Vann said he was "quite honored to be part of this parade" and added that "the value of a real hero is emerging from the support being given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to follow Bellator 206, but instead saw "Derrkucen Pepa"
Imagine, you've been up all night to see the Bellator 206, and then you're taken away from the opportunity to see this main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 dubbings, including six dubbings in the base package and will be shown in real time overnight on Channel 5, in the UK.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in Britain were surprised when the broadcast changed to feature Derrkucen Pepa.
Some were unhappy because they had been awake all night until the first hours, especially for this match.
A Twitter fan described the move from the game to a children's cartoon as "a nasty joke."
"It's the government's rules that determine that at 6 a.m. that content wasn't appropriate to it and we should move on to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator when asked about the broadcast.
"Pep's derrick, yes."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"When I think about retransmission, I think we can solve it," Coker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning, Sunday and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our hour, so Monday with their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed there were many messages circulating and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We're going to do the show with 5 games instead of the sixth - as we usually do - we tried to give more to the fans and maybe we exceeded the goal.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels ‘inferior’ about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to achieve success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to school nine years ago that "not everyone was like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 program of Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he raised his voice on gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less about winning an Olympic medal.
Kirsty Young, the permanent host of the long-term program, has taken a few months off because she is ill.
Appearing as a shy person on Laverne's first program, Daley said that as he grew up he felt "inferior" to others because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt differently, have been the real elements that gave me the impetus and the strength to get out of it."
He wanted to prove that it was worth "something," he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they found out about his sexual orientation.
Two-time Olympic bronze medal winner, he is already a high-profile LGBT activist and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to make more appeals to countries that legitimize homosexuality.
He said he came out open because he felt lucky that he was able to live open and without consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
Three times the world champion said he fell in love with a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "unpreparedly caught me."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When he experiences so many things at such a young age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced the same declines.
The couple became parents in June, of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I thought was 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son holds the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with head cancer.
Daley said his father didn't admit he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if we had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him that you couldn’t be in the first place,” he said.
"I was holding his hand as he refused to take a breath and only after the refusal to take a breath and changed his life and accepted for the first time that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of the local audience at the Olympics, there was no more beautiful feeling," he said.
Also, this inspired his first musical selection - Proud of Heather Small - which has accompanied him during preparations for the Olympic Games and continues to cause mornica.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson, out of shape, was left on Saturday in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but will have to change his form in order not to turn this historic moment into a disappointment.
Mickelson, for whom it is the 12th time he participates in this event, a record of his own, which is held every two years, was left on the table by captain Jim Furyk, during the doubles games (fourballs and foursomes).
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it usually has been for the United States, five times the winner of the big titles, he spent the day supporting the team and working in the hope that he would leave behind the worries.
Not among the players with the most fair shot even when he was at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not a suitable player for the complicated Le Golf National field, where long and difficult fields leave no room for mis-shoots.
And if it wasn’t enough just fear of the field, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who has formed a team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win their fourth game this week.
If the Americans, who have four points less, before the start of the 12-game draw, start it fast, Mickelson's game could be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, though he couldn't say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a blow to my shoulders, threw my hand on my neck and told me it would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's made a lot of contributions to these teams in the past, and during this week.
"I didn't think he would play two games.
I had thought more, but in the end it worked out and so we thought it was the solution.
He wants to be on the field, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the player with the most appearances in the Ryder Cup matches.
He can mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, where he has not been at the height of his individual appearances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence brings value to the team.
"He's gaudy, sarcastic, sharp, likes to bully people, and he's a fantastic guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"Also, I think the younger players were having fun facing him, during this week, and that was nice to see.
It's more than just a game."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leader can disappear very soon.
Thomas Bjorn, Europe's captain, knows from experience that the considerable lead they have ahead of the last day of the Ryder Cup games can turn into an uncomfortable factor.
Danes made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama match, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans closed the tournament by winning with a very narrow difference, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"It reminds itself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead in Brussels, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won but with great difficulty," said Bjorn, who was photographed after not winning 5-3 in Class 2018 on Friday and yesterday at the top 10 of the National Golf.
So the story tells me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we're going with the last one.
We'll go there and do the right thing.
Nothing's over until we get the dots on the table.
We have a goal, we try to win this trophy and here is our focus.
I've said it all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but we're aware of who we're facing - the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players, in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to rush at this stage.
Tomorrow we are going to face another “conspiracy.”
Tomorrow's performance is going to be different, and that's something else to do.
It's fantastic when you're on the field with a partner, when things go well, but when you're alone, then you're tested in your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you have to convey to the players, tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now, forget your partner because he has to go and give the best of himself."
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will hope that his players will perform better individually than with partners, where only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas took three out of four possible points.
Furyk himself has experienced both cases of large returns of the result on the last day, being part of the winning team in Brussels before losing in what is considered the "Miracle in the Medinah" of the European team.
"Remember every word," when asked how he had motivated his players over the last day Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we have to have a good start, as you saw in Brussels and Medinah.
When taking the flow on one side, put a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up the training based on this and we're going to put the boys in the order we believe is the best, as you understand, we're trying to achieve a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas is tasked with starting the draw and will face Rory McIlroy in the lead, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will face European players in the first half of the standings.
"I chose this group and in this ranking I believe it covers all the way in the game," Bjorn said of his picks.
The production of the new German war is postponed again.
The German Navy's new frigate should have been sent in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era fighting, but it won't be ready until at least next year due to problematic systems and fairly high costs, local media reported.
The deployment of Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but post-ship problems damaged the fate of the ambitious project.
The four 'Baden-Wuertemberg-class' ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will serve as replacements for the old 'Bremen-class' frigates.
It is known to contain a powerful ball, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-aircraft and anti-discovery (stealth) technology, such as radar detection reduction, red infra-red and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for new frigates to be moved for more than two years away from the country's ports.
However, continued delays mean that the latest technology struggles — which are said to enable Germany to reflect power abroad — will be obsolete at the time they enter service, Die Zeit writes.
The ‘bad’ frigate, the F125, went to the front pages last year, when the German navy officially refused the order for the ship and turned it over to the Blohm & Voss sea station in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to its builder after handing over.
Little information was given about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a series of "major defects in software and hardware" that made the ship useless during a war mission.
The problems in programming were especially important on the Baden-Wuertemberg-class ships because they would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - half the working power of the old Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its yield and limited Marina's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice the weight of similar-category ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to physical parts with problems, the price of the entire project - including crew training - is also turning into a problem.
It is said to have reached a figure that leaves you speechless of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion that was originally predicted.
The problems that have gripped the new frigates become especially important after recent warnings that the power of the German navy is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee in the German parliament, admitted that the Navy was "ending the appropriate ships to move to another country."
The official said the problem had been added over time because the old ships had been pulled out of use but had not been replaced with new ones.
He said with regret that none of the new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class would be able to join the navy.
The National Trust observes the secret life of the nudes of the night
A new search being carried out by a company in the mountainous areas of Scotland, aims to find out how to use night-dresses to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the new findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help defensive activities in the future.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual nighttime swimsuits and those called soprano pipistrelles as well as the brown clothes and daubenton swimsuits in the Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special registration equipment will be placed at key points throughout the area to track the activities of night-time nudes throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field studies using hand-held detectors.
The sound analysis that will be performed by experts for all records will determine the frequency of the nighttime nude sounds and what each species does.
Then, a report and a map of their habitat will be drawn up to give a detailed overview of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the findings will show which habitats are most important for night owls and how they are used by each species.
This information would help in determining the properties of the administration of settlements, such as the creation of cots and how to maintain forests for night owls and other species associated with them.
The number of nighttime nudes in Scotland and across the UK has dropped significantly over the past century.
They are under threat from the construction and development works that have an impact on the foliage and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as the appearance of adhesives or chemical components of building materials, as well as domestic animal attacks.
In fact, night sweats aren't blind.
However, due to their hunting habits during the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated technique of finding location through sounds to accurately determine insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is taken very seriously by the night owls.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct studies, speech inspections, and sometimes get involved in rescue programs.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to night owls in Threave, Dumfries and Galloway, which serve as a home for eight out of ten species of night owls in Scotland.
The administrator of this reserve, David Thompson, says that this country is the ideal territory for them.
"We've got a great area here in Threave for the night's nudes," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right habitat.
But there are still a lot of things about the nighttime nudes that remain unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what they need to ‘develop’."
He stresses the importance of carrying out night-to-night hygiene checks before carrying out property maintenance work because there is a possibility that the unintentional destruction of a mole could kill up to 400 female and young night-to-night-to-night washes, thus wiping out the entire female population.
Nightmares are protected and the killing, harassment, and disturbing of them or the destruction of their speech is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee with the Night's Watching Trust, encourages people to become part of the help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our night owls and many of our species, we just don't know how their population is moving."
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations of rape against him were "fake news," saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he was later alleged to have paid her $375,000 not to talk about the incident.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram, directed 142 million of his followers, just hours after the release of these claims, 33-year-old Ronaldo considered the reports to be "fake news."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
What was said today is false news," the Golden Ball winner told the camera five times.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and everything is going well," the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to file Der Spiegel for these charges, which they have called “unacceptable reports of suspicions about private life.”
Advocate Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages in the amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the breach, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009, at a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Clark County, Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone to the player's room, where he is alleged to have raped him in the anus.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said "99 percent" he is a "good guy" who is left in the mud by "one percent."
The document says Ronaldo confirms that the couple has had sex but was with the consent of both sides.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she had photos of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "terrified of revenge" and that she was worried that she would be "publicly harassed."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to return the deal because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer passed to the Italian giants of Juventus in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK ‘will regret it forever’ for the loss of the status of car manufacturers
The UK "will regret it forever" if it loses the status of world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays on the border, in the event of a no-deal exit, would cost the loss of jobs.
The factory in Burnaston - which manufactures Toyota Auris and Avensis models - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my judgment, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed fear of leaving the EU without a deal and of how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini series factory for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers refer to as the supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the basis of "as soon as ordered," with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers from the UK and the EU, for the cars ordered.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, there may be delays in the border which according to this industry can lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory at its Derbyshire plant for more than a day, the company said, and consequently production would stop.
Clark said Theresa May's "Chequers" plan for future relations with the EU "is built specifically to avoid these border controls."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4.
"The data, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we should definitely be able to continue what has been a fairly successful supply chain."
Toyota could not determine how long it would stop production, but in the long run, warned that the additional costs would lower the factory's competitiveness and consequently lead to a reduction in jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is a senior union official at the factory, said that members are becoming more and more concerned: "According to my experience at the time these jobs close, they don't come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have set out a comprehensive and credible plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled for another week" as the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's interference in the election, the links between Trump's aide staff and Russia, and the possibility that the president may have obstructed justice.
The debate over whether or not Trump will remove the attorney general from office, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, is something that has created rumors for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein took into consideration the appointment of a whistleblower to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of the president being fired through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, amid reports that he was close to resigning.
Unlike what was expected, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "would prefer" not to dismiss Rosenstein, but later the meeting was pushed to avoid a clash with the hearing held by the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sex, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present today at Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date has not yet been set, it may be this week. I think it may be postponed for another week given everything else that is going on with the High Court.
But let's see, and I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since Sept. 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace raised the question of why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences did not come as a result of dissatisfaction with the attitude of television journalists, although she said: "I will not deny the fact that they draw attention."
Later, she made it clear that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president performs more quality assurance sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding, without citing data: "We've seen these figures."
There will continue to be a press conference, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then that's a lot better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you've seen that we've done it often over the past few weeks, replacing press conferences in cases where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions, or at press conferences with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are very rare.
The president may have shown the reason for this, during this week, in New York, where he made a controversial and in some strange cases, in front of reporters.

The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working at the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and their desire to remain even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, has sent a letter when less than six months have passed since the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in public services at the local level.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations for the UK's withdrawal from the EU have continued, approaching the adoption of a decision in the autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a worrying time for all of you.
For this reason, I would like to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that increase and improve the health service work, increasing the benefits of the patients and communities we serve.
"Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgical intervention after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent an immediate surgical intervention after a head injury suffered on Saturday in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, The Tennesseean journalist Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee state coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the first half.
"He came to the sideline and crashed there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie the oxygen in the sideline before putting it in the barrel and sending it for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/scale of damage" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made five interceptions on Saturday before leaving the game, leading him to 18 total interceptions during the season.
Foreign buyers will pay higher fees when they buy a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will pay higher fees for the purchase of a property in the UK and additional money will be used to help the homeless according to new Conservative Party (Tory) plans.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract new voters.
The tax will be applied to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department plans to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that buyers of foreign nationality will pay higher fees for the purchase of a property in the UK and the additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with pledges to provide more affordable housing and to "put under the spotlight" high-income people.
The levy will be applied to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, while the additional money will support the government's initiative to combat the lack of housing.
This extra fee - which is added to the current rent tax, including the increase in the tax rate presented two years ago for second homes and for properties purchased for rent - can go up to three percent.
The Treasury Department predicts that this move will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people residing outside the UK, which causes price increases and makes it harder to find shelter from buyers for the first time.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have returned to "fantasy cities" due to the high number of foreign-born buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in poultry tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the major construction firms of keeping prices high by buying land but without putting it into use, and called on Mrs. May to waive quotas for affordable homes, in order to settle the "Britain's bull with property."
Mr. Corbyn has proposed some attractive housing reforms, including the control of rent and the removal of "no reason" departures.
Also, he wants to give more power to the councils to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I declared that I would dedicate the prime minister's mandate to the return of the British dream - that is, to a better life for every new generation.
And that means we're fixing the problem of the home market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK and foreign societies have a simpler way of buying houses than British working-class residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become something too difficult to achieve and injustice to the homeless is more than real."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to coach Scotland'
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his "biggest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
Scotland, 42, is enjoying the challenge of renewing the North-Eastern club, which currently ranks third in League One (third category), three points away from the head.
He came this summer at the Stadion de Dria after returning to the Scottish Premier League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
He appeared once in representative B and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But as a child I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden many times with my father, and it's something that has always attracted me.
However, this opportunity will come only if I am successful in leading the clubs."
Ross' predecessors in Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he's not worried he's following in the footsteps of these big names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, my success will depend on the fact that 'can I bring this team back to the Premier League?'
"Given the structure and atmosphere of this club, he certainly has his place in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not a simple task to go there, but I would see myself as successful only if I can get the club back in the Premier League.
Ross has only three years to start his career as a coach after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month period at Hearts' management staff.
He then helped Alloa climb a higher category to the third round of the cup, as well as transformed St Mirren from a club near the fall from the category to the winners of the Championship title next season.
And now, Ross says he feels better than he's ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"Perhaps it was really a turning point," he says, for taking the direction of Alloa.
"I really believed that training was the right thing for me, rather than being a player.
It seems strange because I played well, made a good life thanks to this profession, and enjoyed some good achievements.
Being a player can be difficult.
You have to do a lot of things every week.
Again, I experience a lot of stress and pressure from work but training seems to be the right job.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing something like that. I've never been so good and so self-centered all my life as an adult."

According to a study, the perfect time to "drink a beer" is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased the revenue of the premises in difficult situations in the UK, but has increased the pressure on the restaurant chains.
The data shows that sales in groups of premises and bars increased by 2.7 percent in July - but purchases in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, business consultant at the CGA, which compiled the data, said: "Continuous weather with the sun as well as England's participation in the World Cup longer than expected influenced July to follow the same trend as June, where sales of premises continued to grow.
Restaurant turnover fell by 1.8% in June, and worsened even further in July.
Bars and premises with main activity offering drinks recorded the best performance, with a higher increase than the reduction of trade in restaurants.
Locals with main activity food supply also recognized a decline as a result of the sunny weather, although not as significant as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
Sales of drinks in bars and locals increased by 6.6 percent that month, while food sales fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results confirm the trend we've seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the non-home market, the weather and impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to face difficulties, although a drop in sales by 4.8 percent per year will have a particularly heavy burden considering the continued pressure of costs.
The long, hot summer couldn't come at a more difficult time for food operators and time will tell if the average temperatures of August will give the much-desired tranquility."
The total increase in sales at local and restaurants, including those newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Index of Industry Sales Tracking, for the bar and restaurant sector in the UK, collects and analyzes data from 47 companies, with a total turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the industry's benchmark.
One in five children have hidden accounts on social media that hide them from their parents.
According to a study, one in five children - some of whom are not older than 11 - have hidden accounts on social media that hide them from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old students showed an increase in "false Insta" profiles.
This article has raised the fear of posts with sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "principal" account that tells their parents
One in five children - some of whom are no more than 11 - are opening social media accounts, which are secretly used by adults.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old students showed rapid growth in "false Insta" profiles - which are linked to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
This news has increased the fear of posts with sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they use a clean "principal" account that shows it to their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, found that a teenager was encouraging others to "rape" her.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (the "Headmasters and Headmistresses" Conference - HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had hidden accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create social spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on board the Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Athletics in Scotland, as the non-executive director of this governing body, during the annual general assembly meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete of the track and field and President Ian Beattie described this decision as a great opportunity for all sports managers to benefit from her extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys massive respect in the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit tremendously by making it part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to serve as the voice of the athletes and I very much hope that I will contribute and help drive the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter race at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, with four Olympic gold medals in total and who is a regular expert on the BBC, lost the ability to walk after a temporary ischemic stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It took a daunting job but here I came to fully recover, I learned to walk again and today I'm doing skill exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages."
Breast pump advertising that compares mothers to cows shares public opinion
A company for the production of breast pumps has shared public opinion with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers to cow-breeding.
To launch the promotion of what is considered "the world's first noiseless, wearable breast pump," the consumer technology product company, Elvie, has released a music video to promote the freedom that gives this new pump to mothers who need to be released.
Four real mothers dance in a bar-filled herd of cows under the sounds of a song with the following lyrics: "Yes, I suck myself, but I don't have breasts" and "If you hadn't noticed, these aren't my breasts, it's my breasts."
He continued, "Pomps, pumps, feeding bebushat, pumps, pumps, honey, and junjunjushat."
However, the ad, which was published on the firm's Facebook page, has sparked online debate.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it underestimates the "terrors" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product is a very poor decision.
Just like us, they should remain "pregnant" and "born" to produce milk, only that their "babies" are taken from them a few days after birth.
Elvie's breast pump is placed inside the recipes and does not fall into the eye (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "It's very traumatic for the mother and for the child.
Why don't we use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can hold their babies?"
Someone else added, "What an ad with no sensitivities."
Others supported the ad, among which a woman admitted that the song seemed "to be funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if you'd still feed the baby with breast.
The fire made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I've seen what it means.
"It's a great product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a gauze commercial aimed at mothers who use the pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and who feel like "sheep."
"This is not an advertisement that values or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group shows that they have all danced with the "secret" pump placed on the recipe.
The concept behind this campaign is based on data that many women who use breast pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is noise-free, there are no threads or tubes, placed inside the recipes and does not fall into the eye, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while using it.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD (Creative Executive Director) at Mother commented: "The Elvis pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative promotion.
Making a parallel between women who want to express themselves freely and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the use of the breast pump and the challenges that arise, also showing in a fun and similar way the extraordinary feeling of freedom that the pump gives.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has come out on the front page.
During fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the runway of stylist Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly relocated to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of migrant children banned has increased even though the monthly number of crossings to the border has remained relatively the same, partly as a result of the strict rhetoric and policies presented by the Trump administration that have made it difficult for children to be sent to their support.
Usually, most of the supporters were undocumented immigrants themselves, and they were afraid to risk their stay in the country by trying to apply for a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults of the same family would have to give fingerprints, and this data would pass on to immigration authorities as well.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people, who had applied to support unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal precedent.
"About 80 percent of individuals who are supporters or family members of supporters remain in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreign with criminal precedents.
So, we are continuing to pursue these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to accommodation workers, trying to process children's data faster, officials introduced new rules that required some of them to appear in court within a month of the time of the ban, and not after 60 days, as was the previous standard.
Many of them will appear before the immigration judge through video-conferences and not physically, to argue their claim for legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports taken from the system in recent months, the longer children stay banned, the more likely they are to feel anxious or fall into depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Proponents say these concerns are more severe in larger environments such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is more likely to bypass signs that indicate a child has difficulty.
They add that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many of them are already facing.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish 'invading forces' to withdraw immediately
During his speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has already entered its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, declared that foreign forces remain in the Syrian land illegally, on the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will act with them in the right way."
"They should be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he said during the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight in this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" both by terrorist groups and by "foreign foreign forces."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1000 troops in the territory of this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions are good for them to return, and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that push refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They're politicizing an issue that must be completely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer aid for Syria's reconstruction until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to build a neutral zone in the last large rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the deal had "clear instructions" and expressed confidence that military attacks would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out."
U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the government's participation in this committee, saying the panel's work should be limited "in the review of the current constitution's grandchildren," and warned there would be no intervention.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many people with liberal views hope, the accusations and scandals put an end to his presidency ahead of time.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic fund of a presidency in history!"
So far, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers during peak hour has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and has nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million during peak hours, of 1.7 million that were four years ago, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program has reached the top of the cable channel rankings with 3.5 million viewers on major event nights.
"This is a fire, to which people withdraw because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama series "Designated Survivor," which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a former comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
It brings to mind a taxi ride to Boston ahead of the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
He was replying, "Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
There's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can join together and the health of the global economy.
It is a luxury that can only be enjoyed by the most privileged spectators.
However, if you find yourself after six hours watching a panel of experts arguing over the use of "pacified information" by Bob Woodward in his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's leather bomber jacket, worth $15,000, and the Postman said "a suit of gold."
I'll never see Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what he does and makes it look like a reality show is that he feeds you with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the actors who circled and the unexpected Trump program developments.
You can't leave an episode unattended otherwise you'll be left behind.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the time was sunny and the temperature outside was 80 degrees, outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was hidden inside, watching MSNBC, while recording CNN.
He could not leave, not while Brett Kavanaugh would face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the High Court hanging on the peri line.
"I remember when we carried out all those crazy programs in the past and the people who said, 'This is the last beginning of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside the private sector plunges into tight competition for congressional elections
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is facing a cash rush, as a result of the reorganization of the electoral zones that forces two officials in charge to compete for the same post.
This recent reorganization in the Pittsburgh suburbs has put Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won the post in another area, in the special election, last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12-year-old area, to which the 17-year-old has been placed.
This new division of maps came after the decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which, in January, expressed that the old areas were unconstitutional and unfair in favor of the Republicans.
This competition, in the new 17th zone, has also prompted a strong confrontation in the funding of campaigns by the main funding bodies of the parties, the Democratic Committee for Congressional Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee for Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close-knit victory in the March general election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
For more than a decade, that post was held by Republicans and President Donald Trump won the area by 20 points.
Political experts see the Democrats as easy favourites.
The U.S. considers penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, then withdraws
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
U.S. Department of State officials decided to remove U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest decisions not to recognize Taiwan," department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties were only reviewed against El Salvador, which received an aid of about $140 million from the United States, in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reductions in financial aid and certain restrictions on the issuance of visas, would be severe for the Central American country and for its high levels of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American country officials pushed for a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being to follow up on a similar meeting last year, an action that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving forward.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, ending any possibility of imposing penalties on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has planned to hold a speech at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, a signal that shows the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys, returned quietly from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without strong messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House official for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal discussions, provided their anonymity was preserved.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst near the administration, who also spoke, seeking the right to anonymity.
Study the story.
The next event that is expected to happen may be Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction by Mr. Trump, for which there is considerable evidence in public data.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is shifting his investigation to see if during his campaign, Mr. Trump has cooperated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its wings, Mr. Trump will have to give an account in front of this body, at a time when he is preparing to come out again in front of voters, and he may possibly face an independent jury.
These are very if, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump - or that of his counterparts in Europe, is inevitable.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic, have to make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officers were about to strike the state against Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on these turning points, which hasten or delay the incessant path of democracy.
At the moment, Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the investigation against Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has not been in a difficult situation since the newspaper reported, over the past year, that he had suggested hiding the president, and had speculated that he was not fit to stay in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times article was not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. for Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if it is confirmed in the High Court despite allegations based on sexual assault and false evidence?"
And above all, will we vote in the next election for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the residence of the ambassadors I lived in.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light the candles of the Sabbath on that table holding the symbol of the swastika (broken cross).
Having this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, an old member of the Brookings Institution, is the president of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics organization and author of the book "The Last Palace: The Troubled Century of Europe in Five Lives and a Legendary Home."
Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the pace ahead of Rapid Vienna.
On Thursday, the Rangers awaited Rapid Vienna knowing that a win against the Austrians, after Spain's impressive draw against Villarreal, earlier this month, would place them in a favorable position to qualify for Group G, the Europa League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to make his first appearance this season in a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a push to achieve bigger things.
"It was an important point for us because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We got into the field believing we could get something and came out with a point.
Maybe we could have scored in the end but, in general, I believe that equality was a fair result.
Maybe they were better in the first half as we showed up in the second and we were the best team.
Thursday is going to be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points but it will be a difficult match because they achieved a positive result in their last match, but with the fans who support us, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, due to injuries suffered and changes in the club but now there is a factor of optimism in this team.
The team is fine and the boys are enjoying it a lot; the training goes well.
I hope we can move forward, throw the last season behind our backs and achieve success."
Women sleep less as a result of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of how we wanted family members to take care of them, very few people spoke to them about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they spoke to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Life Insurance Society, Nationwide.
Here's where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't show your wishes first.
Work with your counselor and family and discuss where and how to benefit from care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Take your financial advisor as well: The advisor can help you find a way to pay the expenses.
Options for financing long-term care include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with savings to help cover these expenses or self-insurance through your property - as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through an authorization.
Get a health care attorney and appoint a trusted person who will oversee your health care and will ensure that the experts act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider getting a prosecutor for your finances as well.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and will guarantee the payment of the bills if you can't do it yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine if your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about allergies and the medications you're taking?
Prepare a written plan with these details so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial aspect, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What drugs will be used?"
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare for this plan."

The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers stated that this was an "accidental act", which took place around 02:30 BST.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The shootings are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, as the death toll is expected to rise.
With out-of-function communication networks, aid workers have not been able to get information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu, which was closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-point quake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some facts about Paul and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of nearly 379,800 inhabitants, in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a region that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, a smaller administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and fishing are the province's main economic activities, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Relief Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by the tsunami over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami hit the western part of Donggala, causing nine casualties.
Indonesia is located in the seismic zone of the Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 states, causing 226,000 casualties along the Indian Ocean coastline, of which more than two dozen are in the country.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, in Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya ridge in Aceh, bringing destruction and panic to people after it was recalled the destruction caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people lost their lives from the collapse of buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
According to a report filed on Saturday by Alaska State Police, Paul, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect in domestic violence, for preventing reports of domestic violence, and for opposing arrest.
According to a police report, when a woman, his acquaintance, tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he picked up the phone.
Palin is being held in a Mat-Su detention facility and is being held a $500 unsecured bond guarantee, KTUU reported.
According to reports of this network, he appeared in court on Saturday and when asked about the admission of guilt, he stated that "he is absolutely innocent".
Paul faces three category A violations, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a category B violation, which is punishable by one day in jail and a $2000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Paul.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
This issue is currently being considered by the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence, and drunk gun control during the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had punched him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) as a result of service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died on Friday as a result of an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communication networks are out of service and the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake struck the central part of Sulawesi, located in the north-east of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of the attack.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspected terrorist attack in NYC <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has not been given for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, is alleged to have used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a terrorist attack on a road for bicycles along the western highway in Lower Manhattan, crossing pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed "by thought" the eight victims and that he caused serious bodily injuries "by thought", according to the letter of intent to seek the death penalty, presented in the southern district of New York.
According to a court document, both of these charges could be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury put Saipov in front of 22 lawsuits, including eight counts of murder in aid of organized crime, charges often used by prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack came as a result of "considerable and premeditated planning," prosecutors said, describing the execution of the crime by Saipov as "hateful, vicious and immoral."
"Sayfullo Habibullahevic Saipov caused injuries, injuries and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Letnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time New York's Southern District criminally prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union, two years before the Cold War.
They were both executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Uzbek-born Saipov did not show any remorse during the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
According to the affidavit, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing videos of ISIS on his mobile phone.
Police said he had also asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He said he was innocent of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty and not accept the guilt associated with eternal imprisonment without the possibility of appeal will further increase the trauma caused by these events to all persons involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
Conservative Party MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed at the top of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised, during a protest at the Conservatives' conference, that he would "mobilize the people's army."
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" of Euroscepticism - after one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the EU.
In March, Conservative MP Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the UK "would be out" if the Brexit secretary were Mr Farage.
But the challenge facing Mrs May to join her group is highlighted by the pro-residence Conservatives in the EU, who joined you in another protest in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is having trouble implementing the compromise plan reached in Chequers, amid attacks coming from those who want to stay or leave the European Union, as well as from the EU itself.
The Allies insist that it will try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite harsh reactions - and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and the chaos."
During the Departure march means Departure, Mr. Bone stated that he wants to abandon the Chequers deal.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be placed at the top and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were at the top, we'd be out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers deal."
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subjugated.
We want to map our laws in our country."
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue."
The conservative Andrea, who supports Brexit, was also on the march and told reporters: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers deal is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not supported even within our party and by activists who fill our streets and vote for us.
Please, leave the Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: 'The prime ministers keep their jobs in cases where they keep their promises.'
Farage said during the march that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are considering abandoning the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now, this is a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to say, 'We're not going to let you do anything like that.'"
During a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to force our political class, which is close to abandoning Brexit, to feel the pressure.
"We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us victory in Brexit and we will not stop until the UK is independent, proud and government itself."
In the meantime, the pros marched to Birmingham, before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists held a banner in which the Conservatives wrote against Brexit, following the group's appearance on the weekend.
Labour supporter Lord Adonis ironized with the Conservatives about the security problems they had with a "social application" during the conference's launch.
"These are the people who tell us that they can prepare the IT systems and technology needed for 'Canada plus plus', for open borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It's totally a farce.
"There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans to "carefully consider" the possibility of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "carefully consider the possibility of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic Senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting in the community, held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, an ongoing critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could run for president in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon meeting in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters according to the community format, since Trump came to the top.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go to Washington and regulate the broken government, and that includes putting a woman on the top."
A man has been arrested for the murder of LSU team player Wayde Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that they had arrested a suspect in the murder of basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested at around 11 a.m., the police department in Baton Rouge said at a news conference.
Police released a video of the shootings on Friday, asking for help to identify the person who showed up there.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the South University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims died as a result of gunshot wounds to the head," Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being in the scene, carrying a gun, and that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and sent to the police department in the eastern area of Baton Rouge.
Sims, 6'6'' tall, played 32 games, 10 of which as the title holder, last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls per game table.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team instructions give victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions of the Mercedes team "would play a significant role in this race.
Bottas left the first place and almost "punished" Hamilton after defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to make a stop and let Hamilton race in "traffic" at the end of the car pile, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes made the stop a lap later and was positioned behind Vettel, but Hamilton came on top after several maneuvers that forced Ferrari's driver to leave space from the inside after a double move to defend himself in the third lap.
Max Verstappen started the race from the last row and at the end of the first lap was ranked seventh, on his 21st birthday.
Then he was at the top in a big part of the race as he didn't change the tyres to reach a quick finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen ranking fourth.
Eventually, he made a stop in the 44th lap but failed to improve the pace in the remaining eight laps, leaving Raikkonen fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and showed a real gentleman that let me through.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these exchanges of positions," Hamilton said.
We use very weak body language.
President Donald Trump ironised Senator Dianne Feinstein during a meeting on Saturday over her insistence that it was not the person who "shoved" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the High Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, of sexual assault.
During a speech at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer you to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "lawful, evil and dishonest."
"The only thing that can happen and the beauty of what's happening in the Senate over the last few days is when you look at the inatah, when you look at people who are angry, legal, evil and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at the covert publications and then the people who say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you the one who took the letter out of the closet?
Do you remember her answer... did you pull out the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, yeah.
I didn't take it out."
Wait a minute.
"No, we didn't," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter detailing allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford and the document came out earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information had come out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't bring her story to the square," Feinstein told the commission.
"She asked me to keep her secret and I kept her as she asked me to."
It seems that her denial was not acceptable to the president, who commented during Saturday's debate last night: "In my opinion, guests really left to be desired.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen the weakest gestures before."
Taking in defense of the candidate for the High Court, who has been accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president said Democrats are using alleged charges to achieve their goals.
"They are determined to regain power at all costs.
They don't care who's hurt, who's supposed to step in to take power and control," the president said in a statement.

Air traffic controllers are losing their lives by ensuring that hundreds of people on a plane are saved from the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being honored as a hero after losing his life by ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people sits safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many others were declared dead after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong waves continue to disturb the area and many people have been stranded in the trenches in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues holding him to rescue, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower that was squeezing violently at Palusa's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He stood to make sure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could be safely launched.
Then he was thrown out of the traffic control tower when he thought she was collapsing.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he lost his life this morning, before the helicopter reached Paula.
"This news has touched our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands on its own, while the local disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that this number will continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the rubble, while others have not been found," said the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The distances that reached up to six meters have destroyed Paluna, where a mass-mortar ceremony will be held on Friday.
Military aircraft and commercial aircraft are bringing supplies and assistance.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings troops.
There is no clean water.
Mini-markets have been looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Paul on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I am asking you to work day and night to carry out any evacuation duties.
"Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: "Air New Guinea" now says a person has lost after a plane crashed in the lagoon
The airline, which ran a plane that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, has now declared a missing person after it had previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated from the plane that was sinking into the water.
In a press release, Air New Guinea said Saturday afternoon they were not finding a passenger.
The airline said it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in an effort to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local boat helped rescue the passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been escorted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collision and the consequences of the events themselves remain unclear.
The U.S. Navy and Air Force said the plane landed in the lagoon after it failed to reach the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was crossing the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went down too low.
"That's an extremely good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that through the water that had reached the level of lightning, he and other people went out to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He said the stewardesses were panicking and screaming, while he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working on the correction of a nearby cliff helped rescue them, using an airship to transport people to the coast before the plane sank at about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have lost their lives in a crash of PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but Air New Guinea was not involved in any of them.
An analyst builds a chronology of the night when a woman was killed alive.
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office presented her arguments in the retrial of a person, who is accused of burning a woman alive from Mississippi, in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours, as an expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used phone data to reconstruct the movements of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night the latter passed away.
According to reports by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett stated that she received location data from several mobile phones that show that Tellis was with Chambers the afternoon of her death, the fact that it rejects his previous claims.
When the data revealed that his cell phone was in the same place as that of Chambers while he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to the latter.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he declared that night he was in Sanford's truck, the latter said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency is Tella's statement, which said she had met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone records showed that they had only one week to get to know each other.
Rowlett said shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
"He took it out of his life," Hale said.
The defense party is scheduled to give the rebuttals on Sunday.
The judge said the jury would take the decision that day.
The High Breed: What Is Hip-Hop Awareness?
A three-member hip hop group seeks to challenge the negative views of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has moved away from its origin of political messages and messages that dealt with social issues.
They want to go back to the origin and make the hip hop conscious again.
In the UK, there has been a resurgence of artists like The Fugees and Common unlike artists like Akala and Lowkey.
"Another man of color?"
New York's dad kicked the couple out of work after receiving the "racist" message
A New York woman has sued a couple for discrimination in leaving work after she received a message sent by a mother, who complains that she was "another black man."
The couple has denied they are racists, considering the lawsuit as "supposed."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her concern when she discovered that her new grandmother, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman, at the time she appeared on her first day of work, in 2016.
"JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice here, twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her joke, Plasco-Flaxman, "felt ashamed", rested Mrs. Maurice, on the grounds that their current grandmother, who was African-American, had done a poor job and that instead, she wanted a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her only day's work and then sent home with a "cat in her pocket".
Now, Maurice is pledging the couple for compensation for leaving work, and is seeking compensation in the amount of $350 a day for a six-month period, for which she was hired, albeit without a contract.
"I want to tell them they shouldn't do such things," she told The Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple denied claims that they were racist, saying that Maurice's departure was the right move, because they were afraid they could not believe them anymore after they offended him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told The Post.
"But will you leave the children in the hands of a person to whom you have been shown inconsequential, even if wrong?
Your child's snoring?
Tell me."
Considering the lawsuit as "suspect," Plasco said he and his wife had brought a child to life two months ago and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Can you blame someone in this situation?"
There's nothing positive to be done," added Plasco, an investment banker.
While the case has gone to court, public opinion has quickly denounced the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
A new paper shows that Paddington's publishers were afraid that readers would not link to a talking gold.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's acceptance, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
We're very pleased now that we've seen Paddington's tremendous success."
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, would be upset if his work was rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication, last year's publication, was "brought to nothing."
As for Paddington, whom she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of her success.
"He was a quiet person and I wasn't proud," she said.
Paddington was so true that it was as if you had a child who succeeds: you feel proud of him even though he's not exactly your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington's character."
My daughter was changing her life and I was forced to say goodbye by phone.
Upon arrival, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors had tried to save her life but without results.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was too heavy, that he didn't believe he was going to come out," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad that told me she was going to die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The drugs that had been given to doctors to keep her heart working were losing its effect and were slowly leaving her system.
She had died a few years ago and now everything is "fixed".
I was forced to sit back and wait, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I have to be strong."
Over time Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, lamenting the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane alongside other passengers - who were unaware of what she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I held my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during that flight I felt a great regret for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who wear black post letters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted letters with inspirational messages, to a bridge in Wales, as well as phone numbers of people who can call them for support.
Mrs. Davis's son was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, based in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a "smiling" smile.
"Everyone knew him about his smile.
"People have always said that his smile lights up every room."
However, he gave up his job before he changed his life, having been "in a really dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the person who found his brother after committing suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there will be a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created the letters, "so that people know that there are people who can help them and with whom they can talk, even with a friend.
Don't just sit there, you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for many years, lost her 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was upset, depressed, or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed the change in behavior.
He was extremely upset on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye and didn't take any action."
She said his death was a big trauma to them, but that they should overcome: "It's something that destroys the whole family.
He destroyed us.
We all need to move forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the periphery after the FBI's investigation begins
"I thought if we could give them something similar to what they were asking for - a limited investigation into time and object - maybe we could bring some harmony," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "disrupting" between the many obstacles of the opponents.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
All of their excitement comes as a result of time.
The election for Congress is only 5 weeks away, on November 6 - if Republicans go bad, as expected, they will be greatly weakened in efforts to elect the person they want in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has called senators, begging them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has released its report?
It will be voted in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could collect at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to end this situation and confirm it in the High Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea under Kim's leadership
The number of defectors in North Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Union Ministry in South Korea, said there were about 1127 desertions last year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said the main factors were the strictest controls on the border between North Korea and China, as well as the highest tariffs demanded by human traffickers.
Penelope didn't make any public comments.
Most of the defectors from North Korea are subjugated from South Korea.
Seoul has said that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them move to China, which has the largest length of the border with North Korea and there can be passed more simply compared to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is protected by multiple forces.
China considers migrant deserters illegal and not as refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Penian and their talks focused on late denuclearization negotiations.
The meeting came after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed, in general terms, to work for a Korean missile without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress so far.
"Without trust in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and in these circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally defuse the first," Mr. Young said during a speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," and says he is not worthy to serve in the High Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that because of his temperament, he was unable to serve in the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments on Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if a woman had ever been brought like that, people would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh categorically denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kavanaugh was very worried and at some point almost cried or "take his mouth" when talking about his family and the high school years.
He accused the Democrats in front of the committee, calling the charges against him "a grotesque and coordinated assassination of his figure", organized by liberals outraged by the loss of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi expressed her opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony constituted evidence that he could not serve in the High Court, as she showed his bias towards the Democrats.
“I think he penalized himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated to answer the question of whether he would try to give Kavanaugh a motion of disbelief in the event of his appointment, and in the event that Democrats win the majority of seats in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he's not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's unqualified not only for the High Court, but also for the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Affordable Care Act or on the Roe v. Wade issue, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the sessions for his appointment, Kavanaugh was shunned by questions as to whether he would repeal certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It is not the time for a hysterical and unilateral person to become a member of the court and wait for us to say 'how well!'" Pelosi said.
Women have to use it.
This is a fair verbal attack, months and years of inhaling that explodes, and it can't lead to the end without crying.
"We cry when we inatose," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual. What about you?"
She continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was working in a leadership position, who expressed that she was also crying when I was upset, but had devised a style that whenever I was upset and started crying, she would say to the interlocutors, "I can tell you that I'm close and I'm close.
I'm actually angry."
And then she continued to talk.
And I thought it was a brilliant idea."
Tears are a way to express anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an old job, in an office where men dominated, and where at one point I found myself crying out of incontinence, was the moment when a bigger woman caught me by the throat - a cold manager that I've always feared - I've always been afraid of.
"Never let others see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset, and they'll be glad to have you upset."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of Congress from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his candidacy for President.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found in the middle of an extramarital relationship on board a boat named "Monkey Business" and pulled out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very upset, realized that there was no reason why he didn't think of running for president himself.
"This was not a well- weighted decision," she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone called him "Bor<0xC3><0xAB>bardha and Seven Jukshat".
Since the campaign was in its final stages, it had remained behind with the fundraiser, so he vowed he would not win unless he managed to raise $2 million.
But it was a dirty war.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Don't you think they're making me any less?" she asked herself.
During the speech, where he announced that he would not hold an official campaign, it was so full of emotions – thanks to the people who supported it, anger at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and list voters instead of the delegates – and the sexes in the streets.
"It seemed like I had a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"It looked like Kleenex was my sponsoring corporation.
I remember thinking what people would write on the stone of my grave.
"Oh, the tears?"
The U.S.-China trade war on Beijing
The first outbreaks of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while the war is far from over, a split between the two countries could provide an advantage for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, imposing taxes on China's main export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was the one that happened this week, when new tariffs hit $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing has been retaliated every time "in nature", ultimately imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on more than $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to return the U.S. with the same currency, and the world's second-largest economic power is unlikely to give up soon.
The removal of the measures from Washington means surrendering to their demands, but for China's President Xi Jinping, it would be too shameful to be publicly humiliated in front of the United States.
However, experts said that if China plays its letters properly, the pressures coming from the trade war with the US could positively support China in the long term, to reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, taken quickly both in Washington and in Beijing, can cause economic decline in each of these countries, is something far more dangerous than what has been seen from the outside," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the U.S. research center.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
Already, there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, from which you had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that hit their daily lives and their well-being.
The UN estimates that about 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
About six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated state.
But he stressed that the country will not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup trophy in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup trophy after defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six games in a row on European soil and has been winning this trophy in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team managed to get the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the player who started the most difficulty during the tournament, took the first hit in the water and closed the 16th hole with 3 more shots than a certain level, losing the match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds, becoming 1 in 4 players who have scored 5-0-0, since the current format began to be applied, in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one player Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup final.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has played in eight Ryder Cups, has become the most successful European player of all time in this tournament, with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't hold myself today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy that we've recovered the cup.
"Success is the team, and I'm happy to have had the opportunity to help them," Garcia said after the European team's victory.
He passed the words of his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated the 2&1 American golf legend, Tiger Woods, in direct challenges on Sunday.
"I feel an incredible pride defeating Tiger Woods. I've grown up watching that player," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his games in France and now has statistics 13-21-3, during his career in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, ranking second behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has struggled throughout the weekend to get the ball to the right place, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys. They fought hard.
There were a few moments during this parade when we exerted pressure on the European team.
They're flying fast.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
The other 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA in America as well as our Ryder Cup committee and move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be the captain.
We need to get rid of the hat.
They played better than us."

The Red Bay has extended pollution along a 130-mile stretch of coastline from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee County.
Polluted areas can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer areas compared to last week.
The red tide is also observed in the county of Pasco.
Over the past few weeks, average concentrations have been reported for Charlotte and off the coast in the County, low and high concentrations in Hillsborough County, data for high concentrations in Manatee County, data for high concentrations, near or far shore, in the County of Sarasota, in the County of Sarasota
