Welsh Assembly members (AM) are worried when they ‘look like doll muppets'.
There were concerns among several AMs against a suggestion that their designation should be changed to MWPs (Member of Welsh Parliament/Member of Welsh Parliament).
This arose due to the existence of a plan to change the name of the Parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
The AMs across the political spectrum are worried if it could invite a vote of no confidence.
An AM working party said that his group was concerned, "The designation is a synad with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, Twp means crazy and Pwp means dirty.
A member of the assembly (AM) said that his group as a unity, felt "unhappy" and had proposed several alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group was "open minded" about the name change, but judged that this was a persecution from the MWP's abbreviation to Muppet.
In this context the letter w in Welsh is pronounced like the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on any explanation of designations for the AMs is of course a problem for the members themselves."
The Welsh Government's 2017 decision empowers the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on a proposal known to get broad support to refer to the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
Regarding the naming issues of the AMs, the Commission preferred WMPs (Welsh Parliament Members/Members of the Welsh Parliament), but the MWP option gained the most support on public consultation.
The AM seems to be proposing an alternative option, but the struggle to reach a consensus could upset the chairman, Elin Jones, who is expected to hand over the bill the change in a matter of weeks.
These reform laws will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including disqualification rules for the AMs and committee system plans.
The AMs will get a final vote on the question of how they should be called when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonian people go to vote on a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will determine whether their country's name will be changed to "North Macedonia."
The vote was held in an effort to resolve a decade-long dispute with the Greek neighboring country, which also has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighboring country to its north shows a recognition of its territory and has repeatedly rejected EU and NATO membership offers.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ibanov, an opponent of the vote for a name change, has said that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was the price to be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
St. Martin's bells were ringing when the churches in Harlem were in trouble
"Historically, the old people I spoke to said there used to be a bar and a church in every corner," Adam said.
“Today, there is none.”
He said that the disappearance of all the bars could be inferred.
“People are socializing in another way” right now, he said.
"Bar is no longer a community guest room around which people visit it on a regular basis."
Likewise with the church, he feared that the proceeds of the asset sale would not last as long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they would return again from the beginning."
The churches, he added, could have been replaced by an apartment building with a condominium filled with people who would not help keep the remaining holy places around.
"The majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings are white people," he said, "and therefore will accelerate the day on which these churches close simultaneously because it is unlikely that those who move to those condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by the white congregation before Harlem became the metropolis of black people - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
The black community that had worshiped in the surrounding area had taken over the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard, who led a boycott of retail traders on 125th Street, the main street to shop in Harlem, which refused to employ or promote black people.
The fire in 1939 caused the building to be heavily damaged, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild, they built a bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, Reverend Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin proudly calls the tower's bell a "poor bell"
An expert who heard the bell tower in July gave it another name: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
An expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this was the first tower bell in the world played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind who switched to ringing the larger tower bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in Santo Martin in recent months is a complicated architectural and contractor story, some carried by a public church leader, and others carried by the episcopal archdiocese.
The vestry party - the governing body of the diocese, which is made up of public leaders - wrote a letter to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "will seek to charge costs" on the vestry party, although the vestry was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old teenager in California lobster dive
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived to catch a lobster in California during a lobster season opening event, an officer said.
The attack occurred before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a boy ask for help and then rowed in groups to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just an outpouring of excitement after capturing the lobster, but then he “realized” that the boy shouted, ‘I’m bitten!
I'm going to be digitized!"
The whole bone of his neck is broken," Hammel said that he was aware of it when he had already reached the child.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was treated in critical condition.
The species responsible for the attack are unknown.
Coast Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a media conference that a shark had been seen in the area a week earlier, but it was categorized as a harmless shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his body.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for the sake of investigation and security.
Giles realizes that there are more than 135 shark species in the region, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plan to break the British beauty market
Sainsbury took over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with toserba-style beauty kiosks run by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial push towards the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion British beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion products and household appliances decline, larger beauty kiosks will be tested at 11 stores across the country and will be developed into more stores next year if that proves to be proven.
Investing in beauty became a hunting event for supermarkets to utilize racks that were once used as a place to store TVs, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury said that it would double the size of beauty offerings to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current lineup of brands starting from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas such as those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also relaunched its boutique makeup network so that most of its products would be vegan-friendly – something that young shoppers are increasingly interested in.
In addition, Fragrance Shop perfume retailer will test the concessions at two Sainsbury stores, the first to open in Croydon. London south last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and switching to buying small amounts of daily food in local grocery stores means that the supermarket needs to do something more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury, has said that the stores will look more and more like the Mall when the supermarket chain tries to counter back pressure like Aldi and Lidl by providing more and more food-free services.
Sainsbury has placed Argos stores on hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat stores since they bought the two franchises two years ago, which he said has supported the sale of daily food items and made more profitable acquisitions.
The previous supermarket effort to renovate the beauty department and the pharmacy ended in failure.
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but the cooperation ended after there was a dispute about how to split the profits from the chemical store in the supermarket.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury sold 281 pharmaceutical store businesses to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy franchise, worth <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
It was reported that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by adding various luxury skin care brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: "We have changed the look and feel of beauty kiosks to improve the atmosphere for our visitors.
We also invest in trained colleagues who will be ready to offer advice.
Our brand network is designed to suit all needs, attractive environments and convenient locations signify that we are currently a compelling destination that challenges the long-standing way of shopping.”
Peter Jones ‘crazy' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones goes ‘suddenly’ after TV host Holly Willoughby withdraws from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle business deal to further focus on his new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby did not have time to manage their household appliances and accessories brand, Truly.
The pair's business is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of this morning, 37, used her Instagram account to announce that she was out.
Holly Willoughby has made a star of Dragons" Den, Petes Jones angered by pulling in at the last moments, from their lucrative branded lifestyle business - to focus on his larger contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The source stated that Jones was so "crazy" when the TV golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at her business government headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote herself to their brands and businesses.
Their business has been equated with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's wealth by <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that he left Truly, Jones flew away from Britain to one of his vacation homes,
A source said: “Truthly so far is Holly’s most important priority.
It would be his long-term future, which would make him survive for decades to come.
His decision to step down made everyone involved really surprised.
No one can believe what happened on Tuesday, really close to the launch time.
There's a warehouse full of goods in Marlow's main office that's ready to sell"
Experts believe the departure of the host of this morning, which is one of the UK’s most expensive stars, could hurt the company up to millions of dollars due to large investments in product form, ranging from pillows and candles to homewares, as well as the potential for further launch delays.
And this could mean the end of a long-lost friendship relationship.
The mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby founded Truly along with Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones had a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of an ITV show called I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night "We will not comment on this business relationship."
Speak seriously 'and then we fall in love'
He joked about the criticism he would get from the news media for making comments that some people considered "unpresidential" and had been very positive towards North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a voice echoing his "newsreader."
"I don't give up anything."
He learned that Kim was interested in meeting for the second time after a previous meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump hailed as a step forward for North Korea’s denuclearization.
But the denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho spoke to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see any "appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament movement.
Instead, he noted, the United States continued sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump seems to be more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing the best we can with North Korea," he said.
"If we are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
"We now have an amazing relationship."
He said that his success in improving relations with Kim had brought positive results – stopping the rocket experiments, helping to free hostages and return the remaining American soldiers to their homes.
And he defends his unusual approach in talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but compared to having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this bustling arena, we’d better have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Indonesia Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy an Island, Killing Hundreds of People
As a result of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population lost their homes, there was no national disaster statement, as a prerequisite for bringing in international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so this is a bit of a challenge," said Ms Sumbung.
While Save The Children is putting together a team to leave for Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign staff could work on the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said Indonesian officials were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if foreign institutions were allowed to contribute to providing assistance.
Given the ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, the country is still very unprepared to face the wrath of nature.
While the tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on the other shoreline.
The absence of tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning of danger has already been reported, has likely contributed to the existence of fatalities.
At the best times, travel among many Indonesian islands is very challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The floating hospital that has been placed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach a new disaster location.
President Joko Widodo has made damaged Indonesian infrastructure improvements as the core of the election campaign, and he has spent money on road and rail construction.
But lack of funds has disrupted Mr. Joko's government as he faces re-election next year.
Father Joko also faces pressure from sectarian tensions that are still ongoing in Indonesia, where Muslim-majority members have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes when Muslim and Christian mobs fought in the streets, using spears, bows and arrows, and other sharp weapons.
Witness: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored a balancing goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss against Chelsea in the Premier League with one score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from outside Chelsea goal when his team was left 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left side before kicking him towards a distant pole.
The ball bounces high above the goal when the ball bounces to the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually fell past Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get into that position, to control the ball, and players like Shaq always play it forward as much as possible, so I'm just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and taking one chance and not thinking too much about it, and just making a shot."
Chelsea led with a 1-0 score in the first half after Belgian forward Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue striker gave a feedback to Mateo Kovacic on the game, before spinning near the midfield and running fast into the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic quickly gives feedback and runs on the midline.
He then made a perfect kick, leading Hazard towards the goal.
Hazard managed to pass the opponent's defender and kicked the ball into the goal corner with a left foot kick, passing Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.

Chelsea faced Videoton at UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. Thursday in London.
Death toll from Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are reportedly trapped in the wreckage of a 7.5-magnitude Richter earthquake that hit Friday and triggered a 20-foot-high wave, said Sutopo Purwo, an agency spokesman at a news conference.
The town of Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000, is filled with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
The murder investigation was carried out after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found in Grayson Mews, John's street, at 7:55 a.m. with several stab wounds, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people around to see or hear something to come face to face.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still at an early stage but I'm asking everyone around John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear something suspicious to contact us.
I also applaud everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may record something on the dashboard camera to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who felt confident that they knew the woman had come to the scene to ask about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is still going on as the police have said, they are in the process of telling the closest relatives of the victims.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just returned to his apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
The man couldn't say anything when he knew what was going on.
The residents are currently being told that it will take a few hours until they are allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling someone that all areas are now being enforced as a place of occurrence.
A woman appears on the scene in a state of crying.
He kept saying, “This is horrible.”
At 2 p.m. two police van cars were in line and the others were outside.
A number of officers stood in line to monitor apartment blocks.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCc, phone 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 by citing log 247 on September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the last memorial to be viewed as a 'historical rewrite'
His expulsion would be poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban against many British cultural and religious artifacts carried out by fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell community described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It cannot be avoided in the current debate about the destruction of the statues, that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the palace of Westminster would be a target.
The British civil war iconoclasm was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell descendants would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The outstanding representation of Cromwell from Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a 19th-century evidence of opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many people still believe is worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a parliamentary defender against external pressure, in the case of course the government.
Whether it was a fully accurate representation, it was still the subject of ongoing historical debate.
what is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century had shaped the development of the next nation, and Cromwell was an individually recognizable figure representing one side of the difference.
His success as a Protector Lord is also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
Pork Kills Chinese Farmer Until He Dies
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southeast Chinese market, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery, bleeding near a pig shed in the Liupanshui district market of Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly went with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Thursday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and seeing the nearby pig shed had opened.
He said that in the pig cage there was a large male pig with blood in his mouth.
Forensic research confirms that the 550-pound male pig had harmed the breeder until his death, according to reports.
"Betis my cousin is bleeding and destroyed," said the cousin known for his "Wu", as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40pm on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousins.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had already been blocked to prevent it from attacking others, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and market authorities reportedly were negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have also occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts resulting in the man being seriously injured.
10 years earlier, a pig weighing 650 pounds pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until the wife feared and drove the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that the pig was usually not aggressive but the blood smell could act as a "trigger".
"They're just playing.
They're biters, very curious... they're not going to come out to hurt you.
You just have to give him enough respect," he said.
The remnants of the Rosa storm brought widespread torrential rain to the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over cooler waters on Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will cause flooding across the northern and southwestern parts of Mexico in the coming days.
Rosa has winds at 85 mph, Hurricane Category 1, starting at 5 a.m. Eastern Region time Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is likely to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, Palong began to form over the Pacific Ocean and moved east, toward the US West Coast. When Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and began pushing tropical humidity north to the US southwest.
Rosa will carry up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rains in the Southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous thunderstorms, streams of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Low tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates nearing 2 to 3 inches per hour at some point, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
About 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected to fall in some parts of the Southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Flooding is likely to occur with rapidly worsening conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is not recommended to explore the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause the ditch to become a violent river and the storm will bring local strong winds and dust.
The approaching blizzard would cause local heavy rain to part of the Southern California coastline.
Total rainfall that exceeds half an inch is quite possible, which can cause small debris to flow and the highway to become slippery.
It will be the first rain in the region in their rainy season.
Several scattered tropical rains will begin near Arizona late Sunday and Monday morning, before rain becomes more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to four corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some great changes in temperature across the U.S. as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropical area remains quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature in a short distance.
There are exact examples of dramatic temperature differences throughout the central U.S. region on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will form and re-spread.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. regions are expected to start warm starting in October at a rate of spreading 80s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is estimated to be around 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts show a high chance of temperatures above average for the eastern U.S. until mid-October.
More than 20 million people have witnessed the trial of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people witnessed an interesting statement on Thursday by Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused her of committing sexual violence allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with broadcasters shutting down regular events to announce an unexpected incident at the last minute of Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the woman was 100 percent sure if Kavanaugh was pregnant with her body in a drunken state and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his fiery testimony, said that he was 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
There were more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday, having watched it.
The company counts average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Calculations for other networks that broadcast this are not readily available, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty in calculating the number of people who watched him in the office.
To put this in perspective, it is the number of viewers that is almost the same as a playoff football game or Academy Awards.
The Fox News Channel, whose host opinion strongly supports the appointment of Kavanaugh, is superior to all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC has 2.94 million, MSNBC has 2.89 million viewers and CNN has 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Fans remain high after the trial.
Flake was a key figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on a CNN and CBS camera on Friday morning being yelled at by protesters when he tried to climb the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
She stood down for a few minutes when she was teased maki, broadcast live on CNN.
“I stand right in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have strength when there are many women who are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that there were many other things he needed to say in committee hearings.
Cable TV and broadcast networks all covered directly a few hours later, when the Justice Committee would elect to advance Kavanaugh's candidacy throughout the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would examine charges against the candidate over the next one week, as has been requested by minority Democrats.
Flake has been convinced in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, as it was already clear that the Republican party would not have the vote to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Accuses Critics of ‘Political Play’ Over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of "playing politics" with Britain's future and damaging national interests, over her plans to leave the European Union, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, after one of the interviews that featured him on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson emphasized an attack on what he called the Chequers' plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal on Britain and the EU that should collect tariffs on each other was "completely unreasonable."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting that resulted in the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and in prison on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on the goods, WAFB CBS affiliate reported.
After interrogating Simpson, police said that he claimed to have made a fatal shooting at Wayde.
His contract had been set at $350,000, the Advocate reported.
The East Baton Rouge parish coroner's office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head to the neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police criminal lab, Southern University police and the surrounding residents in aid of the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked regional law enforcement for "the persistence and search for justice."
The Sims were 20 years old at the time.
With a height of 6.6 feet living in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
The average score was 5.6 and surged to 2.6 in last season's game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team felt "broken" and "surprised" by Wayde's death.
“This is what you worry about all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano erupts ash in Mexico City
Abu exiting the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern area around the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the crater and registered there were already 183 gas and ash emissions in more than 24 hours.
The center monitored several times the vibrations and vibrations.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash sticking to the windshield of the car in the neighborhood around Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity on a volcano that is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
This volcano is known as "Don Goyo" which has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence election celebrations.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after participants of a pro-independence demonstration clashed with anti-harassment police, and when thousands of people joined a rival demonstration to mark the first celebration of Catalonia's polarization vote on self-separation.
A group of masked pro-separatists held by riot police threw them out with eggs and threw powder paint, thus creating a dark cloud of dust on the streets that would normally be filled by tourists.
The dispute also ensued later that day with the presence of police using their sticks to control the dispute.
For several hours the pro-independence groups shouted "Don't forget, no forgiveness" faced protesters of the workers' union who shouted, "Spanish Life."
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries obtained in the protest, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in this independence-oriented region, a year after the October 1 referendum considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters prefer to be independent, although the number of voters is low with the presence of those who oppose separation and mostly boycott the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in the TPS across the region in fierce clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in order to support the national police.
Demonstrations continued but were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist protest with his wife says he no longer hopes for Catalonia's prospects of gaining independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry bitterly for being able to choose, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory despite little in last December's regional election, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year despite many of their well-known leaders, who are in exile or in prison awaiting trial, for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaratory.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests with his cell phone in support of police, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more stressful," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament election.
"Standing up as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn a setback in the values of democracy and oppression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: How many men were arrested after a house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage occurred at the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired towards the car at some point.
The goals scored by Menga have given Livingston a victory over Rangers with a score of 1-0
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Livingston's victory resulted in Rangers sacking Steven Gerrard from his position as manager of the Ibrox club, for his second defeat in 18 games.
The Dolly Menga attack has been evidence of a difference when Gary Holt's side moves equal to the Hibernians who were in second place.
Gerrard's side remained undefeated in this season's Premiership and faced the Hearts leader who was eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the European League, on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended their unbeaten record in the division to six games, while head coach Holt was still batting since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston lost a chance against a reckless guest team
Holt's team should have excelled long before they scored, with their accuracy giving Rangers a variety of difficulties.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his efforts missed across the goal's face, then Alan Lithgow could only expand his efforts after slipping in and facing Craig Halkett's lead from across the goal.
The hosts are content to let the Rangers play superbly in the beginning, knowing that they can make it difficult for the incoming team over the occurrence of a dead ball.
And that’s the way to score a very important goal.
Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston got a chance, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to help Menga, who got a turn and scored from the middle of the field.
At that stage, the Rangers had dominated the dominance but realized that the host defense could not be penetrated and Liam Kelly's goalkeeper overall was undisturbed,
The pattern continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to catch a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was stalked by Rangers goalkeepers Allan McGregor and Lithgow were removed far away as a result of other Livingston game tactics.
The attack continued to come to the Livingston goal and was constantly avoided, while two penalty claims - after Halkett's challenge on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - were rejected.
Livingston's 'Fenomenal' - analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
For a man, they are amazing, continuing to exceed expectations on this ever-elevating track.
Their playing style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the top, but great credit has to be given to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He has so many things.
Captain Halkett was very large, leading a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert during the game.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Whatever they were at the time under Gerrard, they failed to meet that standard.
Their last ball was less good - only once they could break the formation of the host side - and it became a warning to the Rangers, who realized their existence in the middle of the field.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a variety of welcome in Cologne.
There was a smile and blue sky pole on Saturday (September 29th) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They argued over issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open a new grand mosque.
It is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters moved around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also voted, condemning both, Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
Resistance protests described the existence of an immigrant who was welcomed as a hero by some German Turkish residents and sought as a dictator by other residents.
Crash on Deptford highway: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a crowded street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car had stopped and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist died in a run-off on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday's collision.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were trying to identify the man and inform his family.
Roads were closed and a change of bus lanes had been imposed as well as motorcyclists were hired to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Hurrah
Six officers were injured in a riot in a men's prison with close custody, the post office said.
The riots occurred at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. BST (GMT+0100) on Sunday and still continue.
Specialist officer "Tornado" has been deployed to deal with the debris, which involved eight prisoners and occurred on one side of the building.
Officers were treated at the scene due to minor injuries to the face.
A prison spokesman said: "The specially trained senior officer has been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers have been treated for injuries.
We do not condone the violence in this prison, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may have to spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin prison housed more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous inmates.
In June it was reported that the jail chief was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year anti-hurricane officers were called to prison to deal with serious debris where a senior officer was attacked with a billiard ball.
Rosa Storm Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Flooding Bandang (Drought Areas May Benefit)
Tropical depressions that hit Arizona are rare, but that’s likely to happen early next week due to the remaining traces of Hurricane Rosa energy passing through the southwestern desert, posing a risk of flooding.
National Weather Service has issued warnings of torrential flooding on Monday and Tuesday for the western Arizona region to southern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to lead directly past Phoenix on Tuesday, which will hit on Monday night along with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix mentioned on Twitter that there were only "ten tropical storms capable of generating tropical storms or depression status in the 200 miles of Phoenix region since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a storm within 40 miles of the AZ border region."
The latest Storm Center Forecaster is able to predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with isolated amounts reaching 6 inches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert including the central Rockies and Great Basin are likely to be affected by 1 to 2 inches, with a possible amount of insulation reaching 4 inches.
For those in the flood-free region, the Rosa rain may be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because currently the southwestern region is under drought.
According to U.S. Drought Watchers, only about 40 percent of Arizona’s regions experience at least extreme drought, the second-highest category,” weather.com reported.
First, the path through Hurricane Rosa leads to land across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico
Rosa, still on storm power on Sunday morning at a wind speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles north of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm met with colder water regions in the Pacific and therefore its strength weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico with the power of tropical storms on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall may be high in parts of Mexico, posing a high flood risk
"The total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is estimated to hit the Baja California region to the southwest of Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then cross the northern part of Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will cross through Arizona and into southern Utah on Tuesday midnight.
"The main risks that may be caused by the Rosa storm or the remnants are very high rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern region of Sonora, and the U.S. southwestern region of the U.S." The National Hurricane Center (NHC) stated.
The rain is expected to cause a flood threat of landslides and debris of buildings flowing into the desert, and landslides occur in mountainous areas.
Norton's Midsomer Attack: Arrest of four suspects in attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The young man was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace Midsomer Norton area, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he was in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-old teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset areas, police said.
The officer had already bribed anyone who might have a video of the incident on his phone to come report.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'receives hatred and anger' from the Democratic Party
“One vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s brutal and shameful investigation,” Trump said in a campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "received hatred and anger" from the Democratic Party during the candidacy process
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, forcibly and emotionally denying an accusation from Christine Blasey Ford that she committed sexual violence to him decades ago while they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified at the trial about his statement.
The President said on Saturday that "Americans saw the intelligence and quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
"One vote of support for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to uphold someone who has the most perfect legal thought of our time, a jury with a record of true public servants," he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president implicitly refers to Kavanaugh's candidacy when talking about the importance of Republicans' participation in mid-term elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m really racing,” he said.
“That’s why I went there to come, fighting for a great candidate.
Trump argues that Democrats are on a mission to "fight and block."
The first vote procedure at the Senate level in Kavanaugh's candidacy is expected to be carried out at the latest on Friday, a senior GOP leader's aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people were killed by the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with the number of casualties increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them drowned when massive waves hit the coast, when a devastating earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach celebration in the town of Palu on Friday when a six-meter (18-foot) wave destroyed the beach as it sank, causing many deaths and destroying whatever it went through.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"As the threat of a tsunami escalated yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away so they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Disaster Response Agency (BNPB) said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, wood, houses, submerged everything on the land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed the sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before sinking the coastline.
Some people climb trees to save themselves from the tsunami and survive, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 service centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the BNPB show many buildings and shops destroyed, curved bridges and collapsed as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
A series of follow-up quakes rocked the city along the coast on Saturday.
Earthquakes are felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for Research and Technology Applications (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted in Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb detonated in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, can increase the size of the tsunami, it can be said.
Nugroho described the damage that occurred as "extensive" and stated that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of a destroyed building, he said, adding that there were 540 wounded and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could have been greater along a 300 km (190 miles) coastline north of Palu, a region called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Communication "is completely paralyzed by the lack of information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its members and volunteers were heading towards disaster-affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get worse," he said.
The related agency on Saturday received a lot of criticism for not informing that there was a tsunami that hit Palu, although authorities said the waves had already hit at the time the warning was issued.
An amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the floor above a building heard screaming a warning with panic of an approaching tsunami, toward the people who were on the street below it.
Within minutes the water rolls down the beach, swirling buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately prove the authenticity of the footage.
Earthquakes and tsunamis are the biggest cause of electrical blackouts that cut off communications around Palu so it makes it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has already begun sending cargo planes containing aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the refugees still desperately need food and other staples.
The airport has reopened only to channel relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has been scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia's Tsunami Victims Rise above 800.
That's very creepy.
When World Vision officials from Donggala had successfully arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the officers sheltered in a tarpaulin tent built on their office yard, on their way they had passed through a variety of shady areas, Father Doseba said.
“They told me that they had seen a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
That's awful.
Even as the aid group began to move slowly to begin disaster response activities, some of the group complained of a crackdown on skilled foreign volunteers, who were about to leave for Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, aid for goods and energy from abroad can only begin to be channelled if the disaster-stricken area has been officially declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia's Red Cross.
"At the moment the Government says, OK, this is a national disaster," we can accept international aid, but there is no such status yet."
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, the friends and family of the missing victims still hope that the people they love will be part of a miracle that will improve the dark storyline of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was kicked out of the house.
On Sunday, the rescuer pulled out a woman trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, Indonesia’s national paragliding team coach, has coached two missing paragliding athletes, who had the opportunity to attend the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Those who are still stuck at the Roa-Roa Hotel, with Mr. Mandagi, are his students.
"As a senior in the paraglider field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recounts how after news of the ruined Hotel Roa-Roa was circulating around the surfing community, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to the competitors of Palu, who participated in the celebration on the beach.
Nevertheless, all of his messages, received only one sign of a gray, rather than two blue.
"I think that means the message is not sent," he said.
The robber took $26,750 during ATM charging in Newport at Levee
The robber on Friday morning, stole $26,750 from a Brink officer who was reloading an ATM machine storage box in Newport, based on news from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had already emptied an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Det. Dennis McCarthy wrote in a news release.
While he was at work, another man "runs from behind Brink's workers" and steals a bag containing money to be sent.
Eyewitnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, based on reports, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity can contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing the name change via Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The former was formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, already had Ye's name for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was made before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande to perform on the show, which was cancelled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
As an abbreviation for his current professional name, West previously said that for him the word had religious meaning.
"I believe 'ye' is a commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with Radio Big Boy broadcaster.
“So I’m you, I’m us, that name is us.
The name is taken from Kanye, which means only one, to be Ye - as a mirror of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our true self."
He was one of a number of rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has in various ways been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
Former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made it with or without a connexion mark and capital letters.
Mexico’s president, AMLO, vowed not to use the military in the face of civil society
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civil society ahead of the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador pledged the day on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use military force to oppress Mexicans."
The army launched a fire at peaceful demonstration activities in the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time, when the left-wing student movement planted its roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has already secured support for young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies for those attending college and opening more universities for free.
He said that the unemployment and lack of educational opportunities encourage young people to form criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double A.I. funding.
As China is more active in terms of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of funding that will be used for research in the field, said A2 investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who is already working for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made announcements about AI, even when the U.S. as a whole lacked formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: aiming to become number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Building AI research funds is a good start, given that all other countries tend to stay away from the U.S., and we’re looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Raising funds could double the chances that the next major AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lea, the owner of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order” has already been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has already invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he designed an AI system that beat the best American Othello players, and after that he served as an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competition such as the Robotics Challenge for the Advanced Defense Research Project and asked when the next activities would be carried out, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win prizes from the Government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes academic leadership; it’s a company,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have already employed figures from the university for AI research in recent years.
Lee said that immigration policy changes could also help the U.S. to support efforts around AI.
"I think green cards can be offered automatically to PHD holders in the field of AI," he said.
The Chinese Council of State issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions just like the way the Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the U.S. Department of Defense developed the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Selection Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA (The Advanced Defense Research Agency) announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, recently DARPA invested more than $100 million per year for AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requiring the establishment of the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence did not see any follow-up for months.
The people of Macedonia voted in favour of changing the name of the country.
The Macedonian people held a vote on Sunday to decide the change of the country's name to the "North Macedonia Republic," an act that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that has stalled its membership bid to become part of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, maintains the opinion that the name of the neighboring country to its north represents recognition of ownership of its territory and has banned the country from joining NATO and the European Union.
The two sides reached an agreement in June on a new name, but nationalist opposition argued that the change would undermine the identity of most of the Macedonian ethnic Slavs.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not give his vote at the general election and a boycott campaign had cast doubt on whether the election results could reach a minimum of 50 percent of the votes needed for the election results to be declared valid.
The question on the ballot reads: "Do you approve NATO and EU membership by accepting an agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that it was a price worth paying to get permission to enter bodies such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries born of the destruction of Yugoslavia.
“I come today to give my voice for the future of the country, for the young generation of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MPs say they will comply with the results of the vote to make a decision.
The name change requires a two-thirds turnout in parliament.
The country's election commission said there were no reports of violations until 1 p.m.
However, it turned out the result of the vote reached only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters gave their ballots.
“I came to vote for my children, where we are in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko gave their vote letter for Macedonia's general election in order to change the name of the country that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, had already prepared a small stage and pulled the seats in front of the tents made by those who would boycott the vote.
"We agree to join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join respectfully, not through the door of the server," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can switch to China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring more investment needed for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe most people will agree with it because more than 80 percent of our society supports the European Union and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said the "yes" result would be "confirming our future."
A poll published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute on Monday stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the vote - less than the amount needed.
Another poll, conducted by TV station Telma Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote for them on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be successful, it took 50 percent plus 1 vote.
A failure in the vote would represent the existence of the first policy rejection of the pro-Western government since taking over in May last year.
Witness: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City explored Brighton's entire defence to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were deployed as Brighton's defence at a 2-0 Manchester City win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England.
Aguero made the win look very easy on his score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received an operation in the middle of the field at the start of the match.
He ran among three Brighton defenders, before the opponent entered the open field.
Aguero then finds himself surrounded by four green-hued men.
He turned past one defender before running ahead of several opponents again at the end of Brighton's goal.
Then he drove to his left, to Sterling.
The English forward took advantage of his first kick from the goal direction to drive the ball back to Aguero, who used his right leg to defeat Brighton goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan with a kick to the right side of the goal.
"Aguero struggled with some problems on his feet," Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues an early advantage in the Premier League fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball, deep within the Brighton area on the game.
He drove the ball with a stunning far kick through the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a little ball kick before leading Sterling to the furthest post.
The Sky Blue front midfielder dried the ball towards the goal just before the ball slipped out of the border.

Scherzer wants to sue Spoiler versus Rockies
With the elimination of the Nationals from the playoffs, there is no longer any reason to force another game.
But the overly competitive Scherzer hopes to outperform the Colorado Rockies in Sunday's game, but only if there is still a playoff implication for the Rockies, who excel in one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least earned a place after winning a wild-card game against the Nationals with a 5-2 score on Friday night, but are still trying to achieve their first division title.
"Although we played without winning, at least we were able to know the atmosphere in Denver with a crowd of spectators and other teams that would compete at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
How could I not want to compete in such a game?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the opening game for Sunday, but it is reported that in such a situation, they tend to let Scherzer compete.
Scherzer, who would start the game for the 34th time, held a training session on Thursday and started Sunday's game that was usually used to rest.

Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The President impliedly refers to the situation concerning the prospective Supreme Court Judge of his choice, Brett Kavanaugh when talking about the importance of the Republican public's vote in mid-term elections.
"All the efforts we've made are at risk in November.
Five weeks before the most important election in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not really running that's why I'm fighting everywhere for an amazing candidate," he said.
Trump continued, “You see the existence of an extremely-terrible radical Democratic group, you can see it is happening right now.
And they decide to take back power in any way, you see their crimes, their atrocities.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to steal in order to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we won’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "reject and block."
"And you've seen that for the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "ugly and mean and untrustworthy."
He referred to the Senate Dianne Feinstein who served on the Senate Justice Committee by mentioning her name, which was greeted with a loud applause from her listeners.
"Remember what the answer is?
Have you leaked the document?
Uh, uh, apa.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for it - it's a very bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a place of public service.
Now be intolerant of anyone who puts his mind to it.
When Momentum activists in the local party gave me a vote to condemn myself, it wasn’t surprising.
After all, I am in the last order of Members of Parliament, who are told that our presence is not expected - all because we are expressing an opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she strongly defended antisemitism.
In my case, the criticism movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, in Europe, the issue is ironically the same as that opposed by Jeremy Corbyn to the previous leader.
The notice for the Eastern Nottingham workers' meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For nearly eight years I was a member of the local Labour Parliament, the meeting of the General Committee on Friday night was just like that.
Unfortunately today, the nature of many meetings and promises regarding politics that are "better, more friendly" has not long been forgotten, if, indeed, it has ever begun.
Differences of opinion in the workers' party are increasingly clearly not tolerated and each opinion is judged to be qualified by the party's authority.
It started as soon as Jeremy became the leader, as a colleague I had thought I would be able to share the same political views, start expecting me to turn around and accept a position I would never accept before – both in national security and the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak openly – and no matter what I say – then there will be a social media fence that asks for the cancellation of the appointment, blames central politics, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour party.
And it wasn’t just me who experienced it.
Of course, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and limitations of my colleagues who face sexual abuse or racism every day but never avoid it.
One of the most disappointing aspects in today’s political era is how much abuse has been considered reasonable.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should help develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer at a wider church and with every motion of "unconfidential" or changing the selection of party rules becomes more limited.
I got a lot of advice over the last two years that encouraged me to keep my head down, not very vocal, and then I would say "well."
But I fell into politics not to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was still a school student, provoked by Thatcher’s government neglect that resulted in my comprehensive school class literally collapsing, I have tried to fight for better public service for those who really need it – both as local and domestic counselors.
I never hid my political action, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham will question my policy position and things I do not agree with in the current leadership.
For those who advocate Friday’s motion, what I can say is that when a country moves quickly towards a division of sovereignty (Brexit), it will endanger our state’s business and public services, I don’t want to waste time and energy for the sake of loyalty to the Labour leader.
But really, one of my messages is not for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituents, as a member of the Labour party either. I'm proud to serve you and I promise that there is no threat of resignation or the existence of a political policy that will prevent me from doing what I believe is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: The undefeated Ayr rises to the top
The last two attempts may have been a bit rife with the final result, but no doubt Ayr deserved to win a very entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
Now they are at the top, the only undefeated side out of ten.
In the end, their superior defense, and the ability to achieve the best chances, which makes the host team and coach Peter Murchie get the right to feel happy.
"So far we've tested our game, and we're still undefeated so we're happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The awards for Ayr, they're better at taking chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr in front, but a yellow card for Scotland captain Rory Hughes, given on the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose the chance to score and Jason Baggot to drill an unconverted try.
Climo relieved Ayr's leadership with a penalty, before, right in the middle of the time, he scored then made a single try to make Ayr's score 17-5 at the time of the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try changed by Baggot, reducing the odds to five points.
Then there was a long pause as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury, was knocked out, and since the start of the rematch, Ayr drove faster beyond the attempt of Stafford McDowall, altered by Climo.
Captain Ayr Blair Macpherson was then hit with a yellow card and again, Melrose made a reserve player pay with an unaltered Bruce Colvine experiment, at the end of the hard pressure.
The host had returned to play, but, by the time Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for licking Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson arrived behind the forward injured Ayr.
Climo was replaced, as was the case again, almost since the start of the match, after Kyle Rowe made a goal kick and failed the fifth attempt of goalkeeper Gregor Henry.
Still Game star looks ready for his new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Kieran seems ready to move on to the service industry after it was previously known that he was appointed as a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor Jack Jarvis plays on the BBC's popular show, which was directed and also starred along with his long-time comedic co-star, Greg Hemphill.
The pair have already announced that the upcoming series to nine is the final episode, and it seems Kiernan is planning to drive a live broadcast after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he was the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan was trying to get involved in "the growing restaurant business in Glasgow.
‘The sea is ours: Bolivia surrounded by land hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific.
Sailors patrolled the naval headquarters located in La Paz.
The public building raised a blue sea flag.
The Navy base from Titicaca to Amazon was polished with a motto: "The sea is our right to legally own.
To rise again is an obligation."
Passing through Bolivia surrounded by land, the memory of the defeat of a coastline into Chile in a bloody 19th-century conflict is still clear - as the desire to once again cross the Pacific Ocean.
The hope is likely to peak in decades, as Bolivia waits for a ruling from the court on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course a positive hope for the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians who will watch the ICJ trial on a wide screen across the country, hope that the court in The Hague will support Bolivia's claim that - after several decades of tense negotiations that -Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia's sovereignty guarantee over the ocean.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president who faces a controversial war for next year's birthday election - also has a lot of support at Monday's hearing.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific Ocean," he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts are convinced that the court is unlikely to decide Bolivia's wishes - and it will only change slightly if it allows.
The Netherlands-based UN agency has no authority to hand over the territory of Chile, and has already determined that it will not decide the outcome of the possible negotiations.
That the ICJ's ruling came just six months after the final argument was heard, which indicated the case was "not complex," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean international law expert.
And still far from continuing Bolivia’s demands, in the last four years it may just have been a setback.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the Bolivian government now," he said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric has weakened the good ethics of the remaining Chileans, he said.
Bolivia and Chile at some point will remain in consultation, but it will be very difficult to remain in discussion after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, the deputy government of Bolivia in The Hague rejected the idea of making decisions quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open up an era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with shared profits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales was still one of the most famous Latin American presidents to use maritime issues as a political supporter.
Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The conference is an opportunity to see what we need to solve the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his first country would never have stripped of nuclear weapons if Korea could not trust Washington.
Ri made a statement on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He mentioned about the United States implementing the deal made at the time of the Singapore meeting between competing leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was seen almost starting a nuclear diplomacy that had been dormant for more than three months after a meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was just a "mutual dream" that by continuing U.S. sanctions and rejection of the declaration of a Korean War settlement would cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington was careful to approve the declaration without the presence of Pyongyang, which made efforts to restrict the armed forces first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second meeting.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about the recognition of a weapons warehouse that for the country is the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump
The Paris fashion show showcases many of the latest collections of headwear to the main street near you
If you want to multiply the collection of hats or really want to be protected from sunlight do not look for another one.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne issued a series of large-sized head coverings for their SS19 collection on the stage of a stunning fashion show in style held at Paris Fashion Week.
The truly impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer and these designers have already shown eye-catching creations on the festive stage.
What stands out from Valentino is the cream-colored cap on which is decorated with a broad fringe of a fur bag that covers the head of the model.
Large-sized accessories include a diamond-adorned scarf, magic hat and even a pineapple, but are not made to heat the head.
Thom Browne also showed a group of strange masks just ahead of Halloween.
Many different-colored masks whose lips are already sewn and are similar to Hannibal Lecter versus haute couture.
A creation similar to scuba diving equipment is equipped with snorkels and eyeglasses, while others look like melted ice cream.
And if you keep tracking those akbar fashion collections - then you're lucky.
Fashion watchers estimate that such a large hat collection will be marketed to the main street near you.
Large-sized hats became a very loose trend in ‘La Bomba', a straw hat with a two-legged edge is seen worn by everyone including Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The label worship behind the cap is very impractical the fragility of social media makes a large creation in the beach catwalk-toss of straw which is almost the same size as swimwear - worn with a slip model.
The bag of burned ivory rafia, carved with rafia on the edge with a white handle strap, is a prominent thing from the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famed hair stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see a big hat and beach bags arrive on the main road for next summer - as designers have already made a big impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for those big accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are very important for global citizens
The Scottish private school kept a record of academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with outstanding test results, which were increasingly strengthened by each student and collective success in sport, art, music and hard work.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Private School Council (SCIS) strive to provide the best service for students and parents.
The independent school aims to prepare its students for advanced and higher education, their career choices, and their role as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement school curricula as expected, we see modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable option in many schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, your speech will get into his head.
If you speak to him in his language then your speech will go into his heart.”
It’s a strong reminder that we can’t just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest test results this year, we can see that the language is the top position of the league table with the highest approval value in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learn a foreign language get the A Plus value.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools showing that 72 percent of students get A Plus value in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learn German, 69 percent of those who learn French and 63 percent who learn Spanish also get A value.
This suggests that independent schools in Scotland support foreign language as an important skill that will certainly be required by children and adolescents in the future.
Currently, languages, as a choice of subjects, are held in the same standard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in modern school curriculums and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Service in 2014 found that for several reasons why employers should continue to struggle to fill vacancies, 17 percent of the reason was a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly encouraged to prepare teens for their careers in the future.
With more and more job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are important in the global world.
Whatever a person’s career choice, if they have already learned a second language, in the future they will feel real benefits because they have this kind of lifelong skills.
Being able to communicate directly with residents of a foreign country will automatically make a multilingual superior in competition.
According to the YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them did not speak a foreign language well enough to do the conversation and French was the only language spoken in two-digit percentages, which is 15 percent.
This is why investing in language teaching for today’s children is important for the moment.
Having multilingual skills, especially the language of countries with a growing economy, will provide children with better opportunities to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important in the UK for the next few years, i.e. 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with expert teaching staff in this field.
The Scottish independent school is aimed at providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It is undeniable that today, in a global business environment, language will always be an important aspect in determining the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication skills."
The independent school will continue to offer these options, diversity, and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent School Board
LeBron will make his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans' expectation of seeing LeBron James begin his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opening against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play just a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-match pre-season schedule.
"At the stage of my career right now, I don't need to do a pre-season game to prepare," he said.
Trump's public meeting schedule in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump began the general meeting of the campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump’s first public meeting out of the five public meetings scheduled next week, including a stopover in some fun places that include Tennessee and Mississippi.
After it was confirmed that the vote was delayed so that he could elect the Supreme Court's fill-in, Trump intended to build support for him for the upcoming midterm general election because the Republican Party risked losing control of Congress if the vote was held in November.
How many hours of Trump’s public meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's general meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s public meeting in West Virginia online through live broadcasts on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is increasingly tense after allegations of indecent sexual acts and Senate voting forecasts will be delayed for up to a week while the FBI is investigating him.
But the main purpose of this general meeting agenda is to help the Republican party to gain some momentum in the face of the November general election.
Therefore, in President Trump's campaign it is mentioned that the five general meetings in the coming week aim to "encourage volunteers and supporters as the Republican party tries to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel as much as possible to the states as we face a busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to mention his name told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the general meeting tonight is expected to be able to present supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as pull coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in the last month, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a West Virginia Senate candidate from the Republican Party who is left in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come as an attempt to increase his earnings in polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team pledges courage to defend its hopes in face of Sunday's singles match
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon foursome sessions are what may be required in this Ryder Cup.
The momentum swing is a concept of sports that is the result of findings that are completely trusted by players, and nothing is more than in competitions like this.
According to them, where is the momentum now?
“Previously, they were six points ahead and now four, so I think we consider it a bit of a momentum,” Jordan Spieth said as he passed that day.
Of course Europe has the advantage because it excels four points with twelve more games.
But the American team, as Spieth says, felt they had a little momentum and they had a lot of things that could be exciting, not to mention the Spieth and Justin Thomas formations that played together all day and each boast three out of four points.
Spieth has played lethally from the tee area to the green area and led with humility.
The celebration cry of the boat grew louder as its turn arrived, making an important putting punch to make the series match as he and Thomas lost two opponents two.
The putting punch from him who won them on the 15th was greeted with a similar cry, the scream that told you that he was sure America did not lose.
"You really should try harder and worry about your own game," Spieth said.
All of these players are gone now.
18 holes to be marked.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas for two days yesterday were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
A unique but attractive pair from Europe is four to four and can do without mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided a bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That run, and how their energy seemed to flow both to and from this rousing crowd that convinced that they were the players to be defeated on Sunday, and no player more famous than neither Fleetwood nor Molinari would unlock the potential of European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
It is better if at the same time both are placed in different holes.
However, it’s still too early to talk about Europe’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson shortened the work of Sergio Garcia, the morning four-ball hero, when he was married to Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on the front nine like digging a hole that will never be climbed by these Spanish and Swedish golfers.
However, on Sundays no one can help you out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome are great shows to see more closely due to interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how strategies can change instantly.
So far, Europe plays better as a team and leads quite a bit towards the final day, but the foursome session also shows that the U.S. team has the guts to compete despite some doubts, especially in the United States.
Europe tops 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take advantage in the final day of the Ryder Cup after rising from Saturday's fourball and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The duo inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two wins over Tiger Woods who had to struggle to score their points so far at Le Golf National with four points.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to maintain an unbeaten trophy at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the wrong-goal American team in the morning fourball, making the series 3-1.
The United States gave more matches in the foursome, winning two games, but they could not reduce the deficit.
Team Jim Furyk needed eight points from 12 Sunday's singles matches to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European debut to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after the sensational weekend, were only the second pair to win four points out of their four game openings in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in their fourball they became very solid to defeat the blowing Woods and American debut Bryson Dechambeau more firmly 5–4.
Woods, who forced himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally performed brilliant but he had already lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome as well as seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting on fourball in the morning, then returned to pair with Henrik Stenson in the foursome and lost 2&1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three worlds.
Europe did not reach it on its own even though the day was fun and windy in southwestern Paris.
The three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the measure aside for America by two points on Saturday.
They got an interesting 2&1 win over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in fourball then back again to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in foursome after losing the first two holes.
It only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup where a team returned from a four-point deficit into a single game, although as a defending champion the Furyk team only needed series points to maintain the trophy.
However, after being the second best for two days, Sunday's retaliatory attacks seemed to surpass them.
North Korea says it is 'impossible' to defuse weapons unilaterally without trust
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations about sanctions that continually deepened their distrust of the United States and it was unlikely that the country would unilaterally denuclearize its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant steps that showed good intentions" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing sites, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation it is impossible for us to defuse our own weapons first on the one hand."
While Ri reiterated the same complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization where North Korea would be punished for taking gradual steps, a significant statement was made that they did not reject fully the way Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit between U.S. presidential officials and North Korean leaders that was the first time this was held in Singapore on June 12, at which time Kim promised to try to "denuclearize the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised a guarantee of Korean security.
North Korea had wanted the end of the 1950-53 Korean War officially, but the United States said that Pyongyang must stop its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also rejected a call to loosen international heavy sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "denuclearization first" and increases pressure by granting semi-sanctions to achieve their goals forcibly, and even rejects "the end of the war statement," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us bend our knees is an illusion of people who don’t know about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions will deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party concerned in this denuclearization is South Korea and not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula will not until such a dead-end path is found."
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year, when he spoke at the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s rockets on the U.S. mainland was something that could not be avoided after Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN meeting, Trump last year threatened to "destroy" North Korea altogether, throwing praise on Kim for his courage to take steps to defuse, but the big job still has to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for this, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - no problem," he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should punish Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions should be continued firmly and should not fail until we know that the denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable."
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions for North Korea since 2006 as an attempt to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said after that that that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip is not going well.
He left Pyongyang in July while saying that there had actually been progress, only North Korea in the hours of mourning that he made "a demand like a gangster."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle missile sites as well as nuclear complexes if the United States takes "appropriate action."
He stated that Kim told him to do "appropriate action" with his wish was a security guarantee that Trump promised in Singapore and moved toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all S1 students there sleep more, in an effort to fight the macho culture in learning that is growing through a caffeine-powered 'human bird'.
An academic found that students at the world’s number one university often knew nothing about discussing very basic things about how to keep themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a medical professor specializing in sleep problems at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believed was the first of its kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I just told now, in my final year?’
The girl said no one ever told me about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," she told The Telegraph.
The course, first launched this year, explains to students about the essence of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic outcomes, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce this course after finding students who were severely sleep deprived throughout the week.
This one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one session there is a picture of the dorm room, where students click on a cup of coffee, curtains, sports pants, and books to get an explanation about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as how athletic results are affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of sleep time routines.
On the other hand, participants get an explanation of how long a lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with an interactive icon, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know this won’t change student behavior instantly.
But we are confident that they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the effect of choosing to smoke on health,” said Prof Czeisler.
The culture of pride with ‘sleeves’ still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students that means lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Making sure you get enough sleep, with good quality, should be a ‘secret weapon’ to fight stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he says – even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep makes the brain activate hunger mode, causing constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physical biology that helped Professor Czeisler design the course, had taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that this course has opened his eyes and inspired him to organize courses for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes that all graduate students are instructed to complete a similar study program before joining a competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students should consider setting sleep time alarms, as well as wake alarms, and be aware of the effects of ‘blue light' emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can shift your circadian rhythm out of its control path causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal lowers Gerrard's team mentally
Again, the Rangers felt the sadness of the day off when Dolly Menga's attack delivered the flooded Steven Gerrard team on a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team attempted to record their first win on their journey, since a 4-1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team had just given Gerrard a second defeat in 18 games as manager, causing his team to be left eight points from the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts classification leader.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the first half was over and the Rangers' runaway players did not seem to compensate.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, leaving only a goal difference from Hibernian.
And there could be further problems in the Rangers' stronghold after Calum Spence's line guard had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtaken Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Instead, Holt went with the same Livi 11 that took one point from the Hearts last week and he would be happy with the stunning costume of their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may dominate the possession of the ball, but Livingston takes advantage of the ball they have better.
They should have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first short pass was thrown by Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's wicket, but the midfielder drew the big chance it was too wide.
Keaghan Jacobs's deep free kick met captain Craig Halkett but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only punch wide in the back position.
Rangers take control but there seems to be more hope than confidence about their game in the third final.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he was supposed to get a penalty when he and Steven Lawless collided on a quarter-hour mark but referee Steven Thomson rejected this Colombian citizen's appeal.
The Rangers only managed to make two throws in the first half but Ibrox's previous goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, almost never had a problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header and an easily tamed Ovie Ejaria attack.
Although Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute may be contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserve it because of their own hard work.
Once again the Rangers failed to overcome Jacobs' deep dead ball tactics.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher put the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm choosing Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard acted during the break by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the switch almost gave direct influence as the winger put the ball on Morelos but Kelly who played impressed quickly out of line to wait.
But Livingston continued to force the away team to play exactly the game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping all the long balls.
Holt's team was supposed to widen their lead in the final stage but McGregor stood well to overtake Jacobs before Lithgow jumped wide from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed the penalty again as he disagreed with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned his face.
Almanac: discoverer of the Geiger lizard
And now from our Almanac "Sunday Morning" page: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and I'm SO MUCH AWESOME... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, it was an invention that eventually made the device referred to as Geiger's Pencacah.
As a science-fiction tool since then, the Geiger Pencacah has also become a pop culture thriller, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," starring seemingly less convincing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What's that thing?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger Sparrow, used to find radioactive mineral locations, such as uranium.
When wearing this earphone, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released by the radioactivity in the mineral."
Evans: "Say, it's definitely coming up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But that discovery kept his name alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to ‘Identify’ Bad Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to 'Identify' Bad Cells and Kill Them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
Its method involves the process of extracting immune cells from patients, changing them in the laboratory
They can then ‘identify’ the proteins that are common in many cancers and then be injected again.
An experimental vaccine showed promising results in patients with a wide range of cancers.
A woman is treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, her ovarian cancer has been missing for more than 18 months.
This method involves the process of extracting the patient's immune cells, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "identify" proteins that are commonly found in many cancers called HER2, and then injecting them back into the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, Prof Berzofsky explains.
The same approach as taking a patient's immune cells and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has succeeded in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West started Diatribe Pro-Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his SNL appearance.
It's not going well.
Kanye West was mocked in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which she praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said that she would run for president in 2020.
After bringing the third song that night, titled Ghost Town where she wore the Make America Great hat, she challenged the Democratic party and repeated her support for Trump.
“I often spoke to white people and they said, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
Yes, if I’m worried about racism, I’ve been out of America for a long time,” he said.
The SNL began the show with a comedy starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star laughed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual violence claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Despite not being broadcast, the West worm footage was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the climb.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having difficulty behind the stage due to the cap being worn.
“They put me on the back of the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out wearing that hat.'
They're ruining me!
And then they said I was drowning," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "You want to see a dive place?" saying that he would wear Superman's cloak, because this means you can't dictate what I have to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments generated outrage at least twice from the audience and SNL's acting seemed ashamed, Variety reported, with one person announcing: "The entire studio was silent."
West was brought in at the last moments as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, former girlfriend of rap singer Mac Miller who had just died a few days ago.
West confused many with the appearance of his song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier Bottle.
West received the support of TPUSA's conservative group chairman, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest souls: THERMAL OF THE LESSONS BECOMING RAKYAT."
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "being himself and that's really very good."
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying music or his clothes or supporting his 'art') whom I believe adheres to and upholds a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
So are we," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "an entity officially known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rap singer, Snoop Dogg gets the name Snoop Lion and certainly heralds the music legend Prince, changing his name to a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.
Claims of attempted murder over squeezing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
Defendants are expected to appear before the Belfast State Court of Justice on Monday.
These charges will be reviewed by the Prosecutor General.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for the sword swing in his role as Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of HBO's Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, defying the macho hero stereotype, said that the role on such a screen made the boys often feel that they should be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he was convinced 'there was something wrong' and questioned how to deal with bad masculinity issues in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his toy opponent in Game of Thrones Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he felt "quite strong" in discussing the issue.
“I feel personally, quite strong, right now – where are we wrong in terms of this masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?”
Kit believes television may be responsible for the appearance of poor masculinity with its very masculine characters.
He continued: 'Mana is a character since birth and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the street, that makes boys feel that they should have this particular side to be men?
I think that’s really one of the big questions these days – how do we change it?
“There’s something wrong with young people.”
In the interview he also admitted that he would not play in the prequel or sequel Game of Thrones as the series would end next summer, saying that he was already 'finished with the battlefield and the horse'.
Since November Kit will star in Sam Shepard’s True West return, a story about the film’s producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he considers a meeting with his wife Rose to be the best reason to get out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, thus giving me the family of the future, and from here my life begins," he said.
Rose plays Ygritte, the Kit's love flower, Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in its population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected in the country, health officials said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new cases are transmitted through sex, marking changes from before.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people with HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year the number of those living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased to 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is called increasingly rampant.
Due to the conservative values of the country, the study estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff have leaked GOP senators' data, spreading 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
United States. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied that one of its staff members had sent personal information of three U.S. Republican senators to the Wikipedia page of MPs.
The Los Angeles Democratic Party affirmed that the claim was driven by experts and "ultra-right wing" websites.
"Lies, lies, and many more hideous lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
It was reported that the information released included the home address and phone number of the United States Senator. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee as well as Orrin Hatch, all of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, sent by unknown people at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of indecent sexual behaviour against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the shipment was connected to the Waters office and revealed information from one of Waters' staff members, Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and is an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"Members of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety are threatened by false and false accusations - are not at all responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless accusation is completely wrong and is an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew online criticism, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This sale means angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This shows he's not fit to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something they don't do, they can't be angry.
They can't deviate.
They can't question the defendant's motive.
They must be calm and peaceful.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who accused critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was trying to shift Waters in the midterm election, also voiced his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great if it’s true,” he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Water said his office had warned "the right authorities and law enforcement entities about these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," he continued, "and they will be legally responsible for all their damaging and harmful actions for one and all of my staff members."
Johnny English Strikes Again - a parody of the underprivileged Rowan Atkinson
Currently seeking the significance of Brexit in every new film with a British bias has become a tradition and it seems to apply to the resurgence of the parody parody franchise Johnny English – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the sarcasm of dissent about how clearly we are becoming a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, Johnny English who was melodious, rubber-faced, and incompetent had updated his license to mess things up for the second time – his name gave more clues than anything that he was an extensive comic creation designed for a language-language cinema region other than English.
Of course he was a mad secret agent who, despite his strange assumption, had little Clouseau character, a sequel to Mr Bean's character and a smattering of travelers who contributed little note to the theme of the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
Indeed, he is indeed based on the international traveler and mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, leaving the chaos behind.
There is one or two sweet moments on this recent JE journey.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing a medieval sledgehammer and the rotor rolls quickly stuck in his helmet.
The Atkinson Prize for physical comedy was shown, but his humor felt less energetic and too strange, especially when the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible had been confident to include comedy as material.
The humor feels like it’s aimed at kids rather than adults, and for me the oddly uninitiated Johnny English misadventures and the focus of Atkinson’s film-whispering jokes in Bean’s personality.
The warm premise these years is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has entered a super-secret British spy web network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the field, to disappoint the agent in charge - unfortunately just a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This was the last chance for a proud and hostile prime minister, who had already shattered his total political popularity: Emma Thompson played a very good role with quasi-Teresa-May characters but not much could be processed from his script.
His intelligent advisor provides information that because every active spy has been weakened, he must bring someone out of retirement time.
And that means Johnny English's own quirk, now employed as the headmaster in some luxury buildings, but gives a secret lesson about how to perform covert operations: there are some good jokes here, when English offers a spy academy like the School of Rock.
English was returned to Whitehall for emergency guidance and reunited with long-suffering old friend Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married, enlisting a submarine commander, the annoying upper-class woman role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat eliminated.
So Batman and Robin who make a mistake on Her Majesty's Secret Agent back in action, meet the mysterious beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is alarmingly falling under the influence of a charismatic technology millionaire who claims to be able to solve the problems of the British computer: evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their silly adventure: disguised as a waitress, they set fire to a French fast-food restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking up on a Volta-owned luxury ship; and English sparks anarchy when she tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize herself with the interior of the Volta house.
All the stops are certainly drawn to the last sequence, but with such bitterness and turbulence, there is little children's TV channel that contains about everything.
That's pretty moderate.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I can’t help but think: couldn’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Workers are planning a plan for British citizens to be able to work four days a week but are paid five days.
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labor Union considered a radical plan that wanted British citizens to work four days a week - but was paid five days.
The union reportedly wants the company's owners to continue the savings through the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for the workers by giving them extra days off.
He'll let the employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same pay.
Some sources say that the idea will be 'unfair' with the party's economic agenda and plans to encourage the state to support the workers.
The move to four days a week has been approved by the British Trade Congress as a way for workers to feel the benefits of economic change.
A source, senior of the Labor Union, told The Sunday Times: 'A review of this policy is expected to be announced before the end of this year.
"This won't happen overnight, but four working days a week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy that supports the workers as well as the party's industry strategy as a whole."
The Labour Party is not the first to support the idea, as the Green Party has already promised four working days in a week on the 2017 general election campaign.
However, at present the aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "Four working days a week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labor conference last week to perfect his vision for the socialist revolution in the field of economics.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the ‘anonymous directors’ and ‘the cheaters’ at utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plan also meant that current shareholders in the drinking water company might not be able to regain their entire shares because the government of the Labour party could make a ‘decrease’ on the grounds of a perceived violation.
He also assured his plan to put the workers on the board of the company and create an Inclusive Ownership Fund that will provide 10 percent of the company's equity in the private sector to the employees, which will pay an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their view
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy in the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raised questions as to whether the findings of the bureau could affect senators from the Republican Party to revoke their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Senators from the Republican Party. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could find anything that could make them change their minds.
Kennedy's appearance was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said I would attend the trial, I said, I’ve spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this incident, the charge came up, and said, 'You did it?'
He's a strong, determined, determined man."
However, it seems Graham’s voice will not be able to be changed.
"My opinion has set a decision on Brett Kavanaugh, and it needs bigger accusations to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but what I do know is: Brett strongly denies it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone he mentions his name can’t verify it.
He's 36 years old.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is meant by the Global Citizen Festival and Has This Event Done Something to Reduce Poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive lineup of stars, and an effective mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will witness tens of thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the action of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of this event, ending extreme poverty by the year 30.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert visitors must complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, calling, or other means to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been for the past 12 years in achieving its goal?
Is the idea of giving a free concert gift the right way to invite people to do an action, or is it just another case called “clickivism” – people feel like they’re making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, pushing to set other goals.
It is said that the action has helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will impact more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group had collected 390 commitments and announcements that came from their actions, at least $10 billion of which had been channeled or made fundraising.
The group estimates that secure funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and practitioners committed to "helping children grow to their full potential," promising to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustices about this nutritional deficiency a record in history,” said Tracey Ullman, an ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to increase nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funds for a project, Power of Nutrition, which would reach 5 million women and children through nutrition.
Responding to one of the questions in the Frequently Asked Questions on their website asking "what makes you think we can end this extreme poverty?"
Global citizens replied: "This will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movement that existed before us, we will succeed, because if we unite we will be stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the stars who performed at this year's event in New York, which will be guided by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy as a "blockade" to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary" Washington could ask the Navy's help to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke strongly suspects that Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular, in its place operating on legitimate government invitations - is a pretext to explore a new energy market.
"I'm sure the reason they're in the Middle East is they want to be an energy broker, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to prevent it.
“The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to ensure open sea lanes, and, if necessary, to block them, to ensure that their energy cannot enter the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke in front of the participants of the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself an “energy customer voice” in the US.
He compared Washington’s approach in a deal with Russia and Iran, seeing that in terms of effectiveness, they were the same.
“The economic choices in Iran and Russia are about more, exploiting and replacing fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as one of “the experts in the field” with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
The statement comes as Trump’s government representatives are on a mission to boost their natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for customers in Europe.
For that, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 “inappropriate” oil pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 oil plant project, which is designed to double the capacity of this 110 billion cubic meter oil plant pipeline, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin denies that Washington’s harsh opposition to the project is purely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I’m sure we have the same view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that customers should be able to choose their own supplier,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
This U.S. attitude has drawn reactions from Germany, which has reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I will face a big problem if a third country mixes our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will 'Watch the Situation' While Nominating for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "look at the situation" while running for president after a part-time election.
While campaigning at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren insisted he would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, including putting women in the top position," she told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will look at the situation when running for president.”
Warren compared himself to President Donald Trump while campaigning in the city hall, saying that he "brings this region in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren flinched in delivering his criticism of Trump and future Supreme Court leader Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before conducting a vote."
However, an opinion poll released on Thursday, showed that most Warren's own constituents did not want him to run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "likely" voters in Massachusetts said it was best for the senator not to run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32 percent support the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick to run for office, with 38 percent supporting the possibility of running for office and 48 percent opposing him.
Other important names in the Democratic Party discussed regarding the possibility of running for office in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes PTSD Track Palin during Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son experienced, what he would experience when he returned, I could connect with other families who also felt the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers suffered," he said in front of attendees present at the campaign for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest like "an elephant in the room" and told of his son and other war veterans, "they came back with a little different, they came back harder, they came back and wondered if there was any respect for what they had given, fellow soldiers and pilots and every other military member to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, plus reports of domestic violence and possession of weapons in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenges to new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges to new U.S. policies that reject asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief on Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiffs Grace v. In a session lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not yet been disclosed.
He said his partner "and son who was a violent gang member" had abused him, but U.S. officials refused his asylum request on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors in favor of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produced large numbers of asylum seekers for the U.S., as a country facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy backfired with the 2014 Immigration Appeals Board decision that allowed dark immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignore state, federal, and international law that has existed for decades."
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims should be decided on the basis of certain facts and circumstances relating to those claims, and such prohibitions violate the principle," the friend-of-the court brief said.
Further the prosecution gave a brief opinion that policies that refused entry of immigrants were detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying that most likely they would become entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June ordered the immigration judge to no longer provide asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang atrocities.
“Accounts are available to those who leave their home country due to persecution or fear caused by racial, religious, national, or membership issues in a particular social group, or political opinion,” Sessions said in a policy announcement on June 11.
Souka is not meant to alleviate all the problems -- though all the problems are serious -- that people face every day around the world.
A very sad rescue effort in Palu because the victim doubled as he raced with time to find the survivor
For those who are safe, the situation is getting worse.
“It feels very stressful,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, calming her baby boy who is on fire at a refugee center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance came carrying a body.
Clean water is very rare.”
The citizens were seen back to their ruined homes, taking things submerged in water, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and treated in the hospital, the damage caused by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, was extremely chaotic.
Some of those injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, lie outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to a strong aftershock.
Her tears flowed as she recounted her feelings as the quake shook the five-story hotel room where she stayed with her wife and daughter.
“There’s no time to save yourself.
I think I'm stuck in the rubble of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding his family was in the city to attend the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry for help, and then shut up.
I don't know about her and my son.
May they be safe."
U.S. ambassador accused China of 'intimidating' with 'propaganda ads'
A week after the official Chinese newspaper contained a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper that called the reciprocal advantage of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on Nov. 6, an accusation disputed by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election, which marked what U.S. officials told Reuters, is a new phase in an increase in Washington’s campaign to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently entangled in a growing trade war, which has led them to raise tariffs on each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the long-time governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed workers, farmers, and businesspeople in America.
China, Branstad wrote an opinion on the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "now doubles the intimidation by running propaganda ads on our own free media."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is leveraging the tradition of highly valued freedom of speech and press freedom in America by loading paid advertising on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
“Instead, in the street newspaper sellers’ kiosks here, in Beijing, you will find restrictions on different voices and will not see the real reflection on the different opinions that Chinese people may have on China’s troubled economic trajectory, given that the media are under the control of the Communist Party of China.”
He added that "one of China's most prominent media outlets rejected an offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper.
Analysts Warn, Republican Party Fares Women Voters Toward Half-Time Election With Kavanaugh Disaster
Because of the important people in the Republican Party standing and defending future Supreme Court leader Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will see a backlash, especially from women, on the upcoming midterm general election.
Emotions over this issue are very high, and most Republican Party members are noted already showing that they want to advance on the vote.
That can't be prevented," Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Maxwell School, Syracuse University told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator (R-Arizona) Jeff Flake's push at the last minute to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to ease the anger at voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor will they forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted "November is near!" as they staged a demonstration in the aisle of the Senate as the Republican Party controlled the Judiciary Committee to continue advancing in Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Anthusiasm and motivation for democracy will come out of the list," non-party political analyst Stu Rothenberg, told the news site.
“People say it’s high enough; and it’s true.
But it could be even higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who because they don't like the president, often don't give a vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony that detailed sexual harassment against him by the prospective Supreme Court leader, analysts advised there would be a subsequent backlash if the Republican Party kept pushing him to move forward with confirmation.
"This is a mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the election of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be placed on the bench, it's also about how the Republican Party handles this issue and how they deal with it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to vote for the Democratic Party, pointed to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided on who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly more favorable choice to the latter.
A new poll conducted by YouGov showed that 41 percent of respondents actually believe or may believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they actually believe or may believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt Kavanaugh was likely or completely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said similar things about Ford.
Following the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford as well as another defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the drunk Kavanaugh had attacked him when he was 17.
Ramirez said that the prospective Supreme Court leader showed his sympathy to him as they attended a party while they were attending college in Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventors plan to start a new Internet to face Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launched a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company built from Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and anyone who is allowed to have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, while joking Berners-Lee said that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination."
“We have to start it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create "personal online data storage" or their own POD.
This storage may contain contact lists, task lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about this online storage of personal data is that it really depends on the user who can access what type of information.
In companies it is known as "personal empowerment through data."
The idea to establish Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to deliver the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Currently the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a volunteer community of code makers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change where all their business models would actually be reversed overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide energy and commercial ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on top of Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has become an influential voice in the net neutrality of the network debate.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next web era," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: commemorating WW1 alumni Victoria Cross
The only Church scholars in England to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter, commemorated in his native land 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend, Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 for the attacks on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by snipers and never knew that he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was inaugurated by two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was a stone "symbol of intelligence" that would reveal exactly 100 years of his grandfather's achievement winning the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "passing through a very thick fog under a string of shots from field weapons and engines."
Then he rushed forward to the battle line and with "the greatest courage" led the front line before rushing using field weapons alone and disabled three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German snipers on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action was "something I knew I wouldn't be able to live but it was a very humble act."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid wreaths after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very privileged to take part in this parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is being shown with the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans flock overnight to watch Bellator 206, but they get Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this, you’ve been up all night watching Bellator 206 which is full of rushes just to be refused to watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contains 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being aired live throughout the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the audience in England was made stunned when its cover turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel unappreciated after they are out on bail until early in the day specifically for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to children's cartoons as "an annoying joke."
"It's the government's rule, that at 6 a.m. the content was not suitable for airing, so it was replaced with children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa is a pig, yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said that they would improve their scheduling by taking into account audiences in the UK in the future.
"In my opinion, if we think about the replay, I think we might be able to finish it," Coker said.
“But right now it’s six in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to fix it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, at the time of the change, a lot of text back and forth and it's all uneducated.
We're trying to fix it, we think it's just a technical error.
No, it's a government problem.
Trust me, next time it won’t happen again.
We’re going to reduce up to five fights out of six fights – as we usually do – and we’re going to try to avoid over-screening for fans, and we’re successful.
This is an unfavourable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'low self-esteem' related to sexuality issues
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up with low self-esteem due to his sexuality issues – but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old man said he wasn’t aware of it until he entered high school, that “not everyone like me.”
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said, he spoke about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent made him not care so much about winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this long-running event, Kirsty Young, is taking a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as the people knocked out on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less than" everyone else growing up with him because "it's not something socially acceptable to like men and women."
He said: “To this day, that feeling, that feeling is less than the other, and that feeling is different, has become real things that give me the strength and the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone as they found out about his sexuality issues.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a well-known LGBT campaigner and uses his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to attract more countries to avoid discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daley was married to an Oscar winner 20 years older than he was last year, and said the age gap was no problem.
"When you experience so many problems at a very young age" - he attended his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was very difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced the same miscarriage.
The couple had become parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley saying "his whole perspective" had changed.
"If you ask me last year, it's all about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
“You know, there’s something bigger than just winning the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had already gotten tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I can't tell him 'You're not going to sit in the front row of my dad'," he said.
“I held his hand as he stopped breathing and still didn’t really stop breathing until he died, eventually I admitted that he was undefeated,” he said.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"All I know is, this is what I've dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a crowd of people at the Olympics, there's no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired her first choice of song – Proud by Heather Small – which had already united with her in preparation for the Olympics and still made her chill.
Desert Island Discs is a BBC Radio 4 broadcast broadcast on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson reprised his role when proposed at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American golfer Phil Mickelson would record on Sunday as he played his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he had to change roles to avoid an unpleasant achievement.
Mickelson, who played in a two-year event to record his 12th record, was suggested by captain Jim Furyk for a four-ball game and a fourth group on Saturday.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he usually did for the United States, this top five-time winner splits his time between being a cheerleader and performing his game on that range, in the hope of fixing what has bothered him.
Never been the straightest golfer despite being at the top of his career, this 48-year-old man is not fit to take a very strict course at Le Golf National, who routinely gives a long and harsh punishment for every wrong shot.
And for his own pitch, it wasn’t scary enough for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, to face the highly accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all of their four games this week.
If this American golfer, starting 12 singles games with four points below, starting with a hot start, then Mickelson’s game proved to be very important.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, not because he could say many other things.
"He really understands his role today, kicking my back and embracing me, and saying he's going to be ready for tomorrow's game," Furyk said.
"He's so confident.
He is a Hall of Famer and he has given so much to this team in the past, and this week.
Maybe I can't imagine him playing two games.
I imagine others, but that’s the way it’s played and that’s the way we think we should go.
He wants to enjoy another atmosphere, just like most people."
Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup game, on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup that will never equal the height of his individual record.
Mickelson conceded 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven series, although Furyk said his presence brought some unspeakable things to the team.
"He's funny, he's sharp, he's funny, he likes to make people laugh, and he's the cool guy in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players have fun with him, this week too, which is pretty fun to see.
He gives a lot of things, more than just playing."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, learns from the experience that a person who leads quite large towards his last single match at the Ryder Cup could easily be an unpleasant journey.
Dane made his first debut at the 1997 game at Valderrama, with team captain Seve Ballesteros holding a five-point lead over America, but just touched the finish line with their nose with the thinnest margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we get a big advantage at Valderrama; we get a big advantage at Brookline, where we lose, and at Valderrama, where we win, but just recently," said Bjorn, taking the picture, after watching Class of 2018, winning 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow you will enter a really boring game.
Go out and do all the right things.
This isn’t over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that goal is to win this trophy, and that’s the focus.
I’ve said for a long time that I’m focused on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also very aware of what’s on the other side – the greatest players in the world.”
Glad to see the players play on the hard golf course, Bjorn added: "In this I will never advance myself.
Tomorrow is a different star.
Tomorrow, individual players will advance, and this is a different thing to do.
It’s nice to be out there with a friend when everything goes well, but when you’re out there playing individually, then your ability as a golfer will be fully tested.
That’s the message you have to convey to all players, taking out the best of yourself for tomorrow’s game.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to go to get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk would have asked his players to play better individually than they did as a draw, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself had been at both ends of the last day of the big game, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up with a defeat as Europe performed "Miracle in the Medina."
“I remember every word,” he said, answering the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought his players together on the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start them quickly as you see at Brookline, as you see at Medina.
When the momentum runs one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the midgame.
We also set up a list of players and put people in the different ways we feel, you know, we're trying to do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked to try to lead the match against Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other European players being in the top row.
"I went with a group of these people in a sequence like this because I think I can close all the way," Bjorn said of his single choice.
The new German warships were rescheduled.
The latest German Navy escort ship was supposed to have begun serving in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era warship, but the ship will not be there at least until next year because of the wrong system and its rising costs, local media reported.
The assignment of "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class patrol ship, has now been suspended until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery issues have disrupted the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will come in place of the old Bremen-class escort ship.
The ship will be equipped with powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as radar removers, infrared, and acoustic locks.
Other important features include a longer period of care - it should be possible to use the latest patrol ship for two years away from its port of origin.
However, the constant delay meant that this sophisticated warship - which was said to allow Germany to highlight its strength abroad - would be obsolete at the time it began entering its duty time, Die Zeit noted.
The ill-fated F125 patrol boat had been a news story last year, as the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to shipbuilders after shipping.
There is little known reason behind the ship's return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware flaws" that made the warship useless if used for combat missions.
The software flaw is crucial because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half of the workforce on older Bremen-class warships.
It is also known that the weight of the ship is very excessive which will reduce its performance and limit the Navy's ability to add updates in the future.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz" with a weight of 7,000 tons is believed to be twice as heavy as ships with similar classes used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to damaged hardware, the cost of production of the entire project – including ship crew training – is also a problem.
It is said to rise surprisingly to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from initially <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that plagued this latest patrol ship became very important given the latest warnings as there was a shrinkage on the strength of the German navy.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee acknowledged that the Navy was in fact "a shipwreck with a spreading ability."
The official said over time the problem was increasing, as the old ships were no longer in use but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class patrol ships could join the Navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats in secret
New research was conducted on a plantation in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use natural strands in their food hunting.
The findings are expected to shed new light on this unique flying mammalian behavior and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow a common pipistrelle and soprano as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in the main location around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Voice experts who analyze all the recordings will ensure the frequency of bat calls and which species do what activities.
Then maps and habitat reports will be created to create images with a detailed scale of natural ranges about their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for NTS, hopes this result will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine what benefits are gained from habitat management work such as lawn making and the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout England has declined sharply in recent centuries.
These bats are threatened by the existence of construction and development jobs that affect nests and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose risks, such as sticky paper suspended to trap bats as well as chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
Actually, the bat is not blind.
However, due to his habit of hunting at night, his ears are more useful than his eyes in terms of capturing the prey.
They use state-of-the-art echo location techniques to accurately locate insects and barriers on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres of land across the country, cares deeply about bats.
It has ten trained expert powers, which routinely conduct surveys, cave examinations, and sometimes rescue efforts.
The organization has also established the first and only nature reserve in Scotland at the Threave plantations in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
Plant manager David Thompson said the plantation was a suitable area for bats.
"Here at Dreamave, we have a good area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and all the good habitats.
However, there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so, the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more and more about what they need to grow.”
He stressed the importance of checking bats before performing maintenance within the property, because without realizing there is a possibility of the destruction of a congenital nest could kill up to 400 female bats and which were still small, which would probably destroy the entire local population.
The bullet is protected and killed, harassing, or disturbing, or destroying the nest is an illegal act.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish official for the Conservation of Turtles Trust, has encouraged the public to come and help.
He said: "We still have to learn a lot about our bats and for many of our species we don't yet know what their population's fate is."
Ronaldo, who rejected rape claims, is preparing a lawyer to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape claim on himself "fake news," and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyer will sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which publishes the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus attackers were accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was then alleged to have paid him by giving $375,000 to keep his mouth shut about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in the Instagram Live Broadcast video to 142 million followers hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the report as "fake news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today is fake news," Ballon d'Or winner five times this said it to the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that’s part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they call "suspect reports in the field of unacceptable privacy," according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz's lawyer said he would seek compensation as "with moral damages in proportion to the severity of the breach, which may be one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga were reported back to the player's room, where he was allegedly raped, according to a report filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo kneeled down after the alleged incident and told him that "99 percent" he was "a good man" who disappointed only "one percent."
The documents said that Ronaldo justified that they both had sex, but that was on the basis of a shared desire.
Mayorga also said he went to the police station and had carried out a visa for his injuries at the hospital, but then agreed to settle the matter outside the courthouse because he felt "fear of getting a refund" and feared "will be embarrassed in public."
The 34-year-old said she was now trying to cancel the peace settlement because she was constantly traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo almost joined Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant club Juve with a deal of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will regret' the loss of carmakers
Britain "will regret it forever" if it loses its status as world leader as a car manufacturer after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added "about" Toyota, England had told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of the border delay if there was no deal, would hurt Brexit in terms of job costs.
The factory in Burnaston - which made Auris and Avensis production Toyota - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year which 90% exported to the entire European Union.
"My opinion is that if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will see a production stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's executive director at Burnaston.
Other British automakers have expressed their concerns about leaving the European Union without an agreement on how cross-border trade will run, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the Mini plant in Oxford a few months after Brexit.
The main problem associated with what the automakers are saying is the risk of supply chain if there is no deal with Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on the principle of "timely production", with parts entering every 37 minutes both from suppliers in the UK and the European Union for cars made to order.
If Britain leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there may be a disruption at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and a lack of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies for more than a day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company’s representative said, and thus production would be halted.
Clark said Chequers Theresa May's plan for relations with the European Union in the future was "calibrated appropriately to avoid border checks."
"We have to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that will also allow what I say not only to enjoy success at the moment, but for us to achieve this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The evidence is not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, that we really should be able to continue what has already become a very well-run supply chain."
Toyota can’t say how long its production will be stopped, but that’s clear in the long run, warning that additional costs will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and will ultimately be detrimental in terms of labor costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the manager of Unite's union at the factory, said his members are already increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once this job is gone, it will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have submitted a proper and reasonable plan for our relationship with the European Union in the future."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed, the White House said
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "scheduled back a week" as the fight for future Supreme Court leader Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the general election, relations between Trump’s aides and Russia, as well as potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, which will endanger Mueller’s freedom, has sparked a rumor in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using telegrams to record conversations with Trump and possibly displace the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he would resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN office in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would “choose to not” fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was again delayed to avoid clashes with a Senate justice committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who had accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation for a week over claims against Kavanaugh, who subsequently delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, performed on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for the meeting has not been set, it could be this week, I can see that returning it to another week is good also given the other things that happen in the grand court.
But we look at it and I always want to convey the latest news to the press."
Some journalists will oppose the statement: Sanders has not held a press meeting at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked the reason.
Sanders said the rare meeting was not because of dislike for TV reporters "who are trying to get attention," though, he said: "I disagree with the fact that they are trying to get attention."
He then proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press be improved.
"The president conducted more direct answering sessions than the previous president," he said, adding without mentioning the evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
The meeting will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions to the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We try to do it more often and you have seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump routinely asks questions when leaving the White House or participating in an open session or press conference with visiting senior officials.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president will probably show the reason, perform a free and sometimes weird appearance before the reporters gather.
Health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers at the Scottish NHS on concerns over Brexit issues
The Health Secretary has written a letter to the European Union staff working at the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the country and hope they will still work here after the Brexit issue.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter in less than six months until Britain withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish government has committed to meet the cost of submitting permanent status for European Union citizens working in transferred public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on this withdrawal are still ongoing, approaching the expected decision this fall.
But the British government has also been prepared for a possible scenario of no deal.
I know this must be very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I now want to reaffirm how much I greatly appreciate the contributions of every member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union, and others, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the health service work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we very much want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers backfielder Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennesse's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the round ended.
"He came to the edge of the field and fell faint there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical power give oxygen to Abercrombie on the edge of the field before placing it on the tundra and taking it to be further evaluated.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had already left the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/degree of injury suffered" and the State of Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, this red-shirted second-grade student, was in his first season with the State of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
He earned a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which made his total tackle during this season to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tuition fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher tuition fees when they purchase property in the UK, as well as additional money that will be used to help homeless people according to Tory’s new plan.
This move will curb the success rate of the Corbyn movement in attracting young voters.
This increase in tuition fees will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Department of Finance estimates it will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year – to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be wearing higher veils as they buy property in the UK – as well as additional money that will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce it today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with a promise to provide more affordable housing and target high incomes.
An increase in tuition fees will be imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, as well as additional money that encourages the government’s efforts to fight back homelessness.
The additional cost – which is an additional cost on current matriarchal costs, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second home purchases and home purchases for rent – could reach three percent.
The Department of Finance expects this move to rise to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London were purchased by non-English residents, which caused price increases and made it increasingly difficult for the first buyer to step foot on the housing ladder.
Many of the country's rich areas - usually in the capital - have become " ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy came out just a week after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the cost of the nursery in order to help more young people have their first home.
He accused the large construction company of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged Ny May to ignore quotas for affordable homes in order to fix the "domestic damage" in the UK.
Corbyn has announced a series of reform proposals in the area of interesting housing, including rent supervision and ending the deletion of "without guilt".
He also wanted to give greater power to the council to build new houses.
Ny May said: "Last year I promised I would dedicate the prime minister's office to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every generation.
And that means improving our bustling housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it is not the right thing for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, to buy homes as easy as those who are already working hard.
For many people the dream of having a home becomes something very far away, and the unfair treatment of the underworld remains real."
Jack Ross: 'My main ambition is to lead Scotland's team'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "primary ambition" was to be Scotland's manager at several stages.
This 42-year-old Scottish player, enjoyed the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One, a three-point gap from the top position.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to defend my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that's him," Ross told Sportsound, BBC Scotland.
"But I'm big and I often watch the Scottish team at Hampden with my father as a kid, and it's always been something that interests me to come back.
However, that opportunity will come, if I succeed in team management."
Sunderland's managers before Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he did not feel shy following in the footsteps of such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the current success will be measured by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities that exist at this club, there is no doubt about being in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to be there, but I’ll probably just see myself as a successful person here, if I can take this club back there.”
Ross's career in team management was only three years, after some time as assistant boss at Dumbarton, and spent 15 months as coaching staff at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the degradation to third place, and turned St Mirren from the degradation gap to the championship title winner the following season.
And Ross says now he feels more comfortable than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a crossroads that I have to cross," he recalled as he took over Alloa.
"I'm really sure management is the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds really weird because I’m fine, looking for a decent living, and enjoying some decent things.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you need to go through every week.
I still experience it in terms of work pressure, but in management it feels good.
I’ve always wanted to lead something and now I do it, the most comfortable feeling I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The survey found the right time to drink beer was 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
Summer heatwaves have increased the income of pubs in the UK that are struggling to survive, but more put pressure on the restaurant network.
According to the figures, pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July – but revenue in restaurants dropped by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant, who compiled the figures, said: "The sun shining brightly and Britain's participation in the World Cup longer than expected means, July will follow the same pattern as the previous June, where pub revenue increased by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that get a hard hit.
The drop in restaurant trade of 1.8 percent in June will worsen in July.
The sale of pubs and bars that sell drinks so far has been the strongest compared to the one that happened to the restaurants that went down.
Pubs that sell food also suffer from the heat of the sun, although not as bad as restaurant operators.
It looks like people are just out for a drink.
Sales across pubs and managed bars that sell drinks rose 6.6 percent for this month, with those selling food down three percent."
Paul Newman, RSM’s recreation and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since April.
The weather and impact of major social events or sports remain the biggest factor that concerns market sales outside the home.
No wonder that the restaurant group continues to struggle to survive, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales from year to year would be very painful over the ongoing cost pressures.
The long summer shouldn’t come at a time when operators selling food are going through bad times, and time will tell whether the fairly good temperatures we already enjoy in August will provide a little rest needed.”
Total sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, showing a slowdown in the brand launch.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitoring for the pub, bar, and restaurant sectors in the UK collected and analyzed performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined revenues of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and was an industry benchmark that could no longer be replicated.
One in five children have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents
The survey revealed that one in five children – some of whom are still 11 years old – have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the development of the "False Insta" page
This news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "primary" account to show to parents
One in five children – some of whom are still 11 years old – create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid development of a fake Insta account – a reference to a photo-sharing site on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the posting of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they operate a “primary” account that is already cleared to be shown to parents, while also having a personal account.
A mother who finds her 13-year-old daughter's secret site, finds a teenager who asks others to "rape me."
A study conducted by the British Digital Awareness and the Conference of the Men's Head Schools" as well as the Women's Head Schools" (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 years had two profiles, with half of them claiming to keep a personal account.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “This is disturbing so many teenagers who are trying to create online spaces that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Eilidh Doyle will be a "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most respected Scottish track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie describes this movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the sports field to benefit from his diverse experience at an international level over the past few decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, England, and the world's athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I act as a voice for the athletes and I hope to be able to really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
American athletics athletes, who won the number 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among their total four Olympic gold medals and now become experts of the BBC, are now unable to walk after experiencing a momentary ischemic attack.
She wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctor says only time can determine if I can recover and to what extent the recovery is.
It’s a very exhausting job to fully recover, relearn how to walk, and today do a tremor exercise!
Thank you for the inspirational messages!”
Breast pump advertising that compares mothers to cows has divided opinions in the online world
The breast pump company has split opinion in the online world with an ad that compares breastfeeding moms to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of a product said to be "the world's first silent wearable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released an ad inspired by a funny music video to show the freedom this new pump is given to express a mother.
Four moms dancing in the barn containing cow straw followed a song that included the lyrics like this: "Yes, I'm barking myself, but you don't see a tail" and "If you don't notice it this is not an ambiance, this is my breast."
Continued with the refrain: "Pump out, pump out, I feed them honey, pump out, pump out, I sprinkle my wife's milk."
However, the ads that have been published on the company’s Facebook page, have caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it made “crazy” in the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, cows should also be pregnant and giving birth to produce milk, unless their baby is stolen from them within a few days after giving birth," one wrote.
Elvie breast pump is very suitable in bra nursing (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "The trauma that can be understood is good for mom and baby.
But why not use it to advertise a breast pump for the mother who has to take care of her baby?”
Another added: "A missing ad."
Others defended the ad, with a woman admitting that she found the song "funny."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'll buy it if I'm still breastfeeding.
Squeezing makes me feel just like a cow.
It's kind of crazy, but I accept it as it is.
"It's a great product," someone wrote.
Others commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at moms who squeeze (often in their workplace or toilet) and who feel like "wool."
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all felt dancing with hidden pumps lurking in their bras.
The basis of this campaign concept comes from the insights of many women who squeeze ASI who say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, without cable or tube and fit inside the nursing bra, which gives women the freedom to move, push their baby, and even go out while shaving.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie pump is a pioneering product that deserves to be launched with convincing and provocative.
By comparing the picture between expressing women and cattle we want to pump up ASI and all its challenges, as well as showing it through a way of entertaining and pleasurable with the full freedom presented by the new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has been the main news.
In London Fashion Week, a mother with two children performed on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski using this product.
Hundreds of Migrants Move Secretly to Tent Camps on Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained is increasing even though the monthly border crossing remains unchanged, partly as a result of the harsh statements and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it difficult to care for children with sponsors.
Basically, most of the sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants, and are afraid of jeopardizing their own ability to stay in the country by stepping forward to save children.
The risk was increasing in June, as the federal government announced that prospective sponsors and other adult members of their households had to hand over fingerprints, and the data would be shared with the immigration government.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and tax official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor underage children.
The agency later made sure that 70 percent of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who become sponsors or members of a sponsor group exist in the country illegally, and most of them are evil foreigners.
That's why we keep chasing those people," Mr. Albence said.
Aiming to process children faster, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which became the previous standard, said workers at the shelter.
Most of them appear through video conference calls, not directly, to apply for their legal status case to immigration judges.
Those deemed unfit to receive assistance will be immediately deported.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, resulting in increased violence or escape attempts, said workers in shelters and system reports received in recent months.
Lawyers said the concern increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, whose signs are in a struggling child tend to be ignored, because of its size.
They say that moving children to the city of camp without providing enough time for them emotionally or saying goodbye to his friends can aggravate the trauma that has already been fought a lot.
Syria calls on 'occupying forces' from the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has now entered its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops occupied Syria illegally, on grounds of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw as soon as possible and without submitting any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem confirmed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, with more than millions fleeing their homes.
He stressed that Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terror groups and "the presence of illegal foreign troops."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, particularly training and influencing Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in war-torn territory.
Regarding the refugee problems, Moualem insisted that they should return soon, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading an extraordinary fear" that encouraged refugees to get further away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politicize what should be a humane problem entirely."
The European Union and the United States warned that there would be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement was agreed between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last large stronghold of Idlib rebels has resulted in opportunities to continue political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented massive attacks by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where there are three million people living.
However, Moualem insisted that the deal had "clear deadlines" and raised hopes that military action would target the mujahideen including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be sacked."
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to quickly hold the first meeting of a new committee consisting of the government and opposition members to make a post-war law for Syria and pave the way for a general election.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's involvement in the committee, stressing that the panel's work should be limited "to review the latest articles of the Law," and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Second Period
According to the logic, Trump will win the general election again in 2020 except, as many hopeful liberals, prosecutions and scandals end his presidency early.
No one doubts, "The end of the most dramatic presidency ever!"
So far, there are no signs of fatigue for the audience.
Since 2014, CNN’s prime-time rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers of the main show, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked at the top of the cable TV rankings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on the main news night.
"It's a spirit that makes people interested because it's something they don't understand," said Neal Baer, the host of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a senior comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths In sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
He recalled riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 general election.
The driver said he would give Trump the right to vote.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'Because she made me laugh,'" Miss Scovell told me.
There is value in entertainment in a mess.
Certainly, unlike any other show on TV, the storyline emerging from Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families could reunite and restore the global economy.
Instead, the luxury that can only be felt by the most special audience.
However, not only did you become a knowledgeable citizen at six o’clock you found yourself witnessing a panel of experts discussing the use of a “background” source Bob Woodward for his book titled “Fear,” wearing Paul Manafort’s velvet bomber jacket worth $15,000 (”a thick suit of Postmy’s and Themables,” on the Washington Post.
This time, I would never see Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of the policy he’s made him do the same as a reality show that entertains you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the actor’s show scene and daily storyline Trump (chooses hostile to the NFL).

A lot of money from outside flooded the most tight part-time election competition in the White House
It was only natural for Pennsylvania 17 to get a flood of money, thanks to the reshuffling of the congressional district that scuttled two pennies in the same chair debate.
The recently re-arranged Pittsburg district, nominated Conor Lamb of Rep. Democrats - who won seats in another district through a special election last spring.
Lamb advanced against another pawn, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who now represents the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which overlaps with the new Pennsylvania 17 district.
These maps were rearranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January decided that the old districts unconstitutionally sided with the Republican party.
Competition in Pennsylvania's new 17th district has resulted in large campaign funds between the big party's financial side, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became increasingly known in Pennsylvania after a thin victory in a March-monitored general election for the Pennsylvania 18th Congressional District.
The seat has been occupied by Republican officials for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts are sending the Democratic party a little superior.
U.S. Considers Giving El Salvador Penalty for Supporting China, Then Backs
The diplomats ensured that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, by giving little pressure from Washington.
President Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and booked a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization management team.
Foreign Department officials decided to withdraw the head of the American diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "the latest decision that no longer recognizes Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a department spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the punishment is only considered against El Salvador, which has received around $140 million from the United States in 2017, including for drug control, development support and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, will hurt the Central American state and raise unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meeting took place, North and Central American officials delayed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity to follow up on the same meeting last year that was considered a step forward in order to prevent migrants from entering the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials confirmed that they wanted the conference to be continued, effectively ending sentencing considerations for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to give a speech at the conference, currently scheduled for mid-October, as a signal of imports made by the government at the meeting, diplomats said.
And all three U.S. envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing a new harsh rebuke or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate presented by all three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations regarding this unclear situation.
Their statements were reinforced by external analysts who were close to the government and also spoke about these unclear circumstances.
The Story of Study
Another surprising story is Robert Mueller’s special counsel report on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump’s justice, which currently has very important evidence in the public record.
Mueller’s report also discussed his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in attacking our general election.
When Congress moves hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable, just as he prepares to go again in front of voters, and may eventually become a jury of his partners.
So there’s still a lot to do, and I don’t mean to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump’s government can’t be avoided – or its equality in Europe.
There is a choice that we should make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long we fight.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, if only the West were against him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of subsequent massacres.
The beginning of history centers along such a point of departure, and the march of accelerated or delayed democracy cannot be avoided.
Now Americans are facing some of these changes.
What should we do if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been under pressure since the paper reported that, last year, he suggested to secretly record the president and argued that he did not deserve to serve as president.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times' account was incorrect.
"How do we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or fair - or if he is brought to the Supreme Court despite strong allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And besides, are we going to give a half-time vote for Congress that will ask for Trump’s accountability?
If we fail to pass that test, democracy will get worse in the long run.
But I believe we will succeed, because of the lessons I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
He survived, then immigrated to America and, 60 years later, asked me to light the Sabbath candle on a swastika-written table.
Leaving that legacy to me, how do I lose hope about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans feels optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna's game
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, delivering a victory over Austria, following a good draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would strengthen their position to escape from Group G of the European League.
The knee injury made midfielder Graham Dorrans unable to perform in the first season until a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he was confident the Rangers could take advantage of the result as a stepping stone towards greater hope.
"This is a very good point for us because Villarreal is a great team," the 31-year-old said.
"In this game we are sure we can get something and go by scoring one point.
In the end, we may be able to do it but, in our opinion, the draw result may be a fair result.
In the first half, they might perform better but in the second half, we got up and became a better team.
As of Thursday, tonight will be another big European day.
We hope to be able to score three points even though it will be a difficult game because they have a good result in their last game, however, with the support of the supporters behind us, I am sure we can keep moving forward and get a positive result.
"Last year we had a difficult time, because of my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there is a very good hope at the club.
This squad is good and the kids really enjoy it. it's a good exercise.
Hopefully now we can grow, put the past behind us and achieve success."

Although it turns out the survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be treated, only not many people discuss it with their family members.
About half of the people in the Nationwide study discussed long-term care costs with their partners.
Only 10 percent of them said they discussed this with their children.
“They want family members to give treatment, but there is no way to start the discussion,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
This is the time to start.
Start talking to your spouse and children: You won’t be able to prepare your own family for treatment if you don’t tell them your wishes first.
Share with your counselors as well as your family, where and how you get treatment, because what you choose will be crucial in determining the cost.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can certainly provide his or her assistance to you in showing how to pay those costs.
The funding you choose for long-term care includes traditional long-term care insurance policies, hybrid cash insurance policies that guarantee these costs or insure yourself with your wealth – as long as you have the money.
Show your legal documents: Face the pending legal debate.
Show immediate power to your health care, that is, someone you trust to ensure your health care and ensure that your wishes are carried out by professionals when you are unable to communicate.
In addition, the power letter in terms of your finances should also be considered.
Someone who is confident in taking care of all your financial decisions should you choose, other than to ensure payment of your bills if you are unable to.
Always remember with every detail as little as possible: Try to imagine when your elderly parents are in an emergency health condition and on their way to the hospital.
Are you ready to answer a variety of questions about both treatment and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready to answer.
“Not only does finance play an important role, but who is the doctor?” Martin asked.

A man shot by a wind gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a wind rifle on his way home from a night party.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when several shots were fired on her chest, stomach, and hands.
The shooting event was described by officers taking place around 02:30 BST, and is said to be a "random act."
The victim did not see who attacked him.
The injuries suffered by the victim did not threaten his soul and a number of witnesses have been filed by police.
Earthquakes and tsunamis hit Indonesia
The earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, killing at least 384 people, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The disconnected communications made the officers who channeled relief difficulties gain information from the County of Donggala, a region north of the town of Palu that is located closer to the earthquake center that hit with a magnitude 7.5 Richter scale.
In Palu, after a disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Below are a number of key facts about the towns of Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
When earthquakes and tsunamis hit, the city was celebrating its 40th birthday.
Donggala, meanwhile, is a district of more than 300 km (180 miles) from the coastline in northwest Sulawesi island.
The county, which is an administrative region under the province, is estimated to have 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
The dominant economic eye in the province of South Sulawesi is the search for fish and matching plants, especially on the coast of Donggala.
However, the existence of nickel mining plays an important role in this province, although it is mostly centered in Morowali, across the Sulawesi coast.
In the past 100 years, Palu and Donggala have been hit by a tsunami several times, according to data from Indonesia’s Disaster Response Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people died in a tsunami and hundreds of homes in the Donggala flooded.
In 1996, nine people died in a tsunami disaster in western Donggala.
Seismically, Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and therefore earthquakes will occur on a regular basis.
A number of major earthquakes and tsunamis that hit the last few years are as follows:
2004: December 26, Indonesia was hit by a major earthquake, just off the west coast of Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, which also triggered a tsunami in 14 countries, until it killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, and more than half of the dead were in Aceh.
2005: Late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes have hit the west coast of Sumatra.
On Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra, hundreds of people were killed.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami on the southern coast and killing nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 occurred near the town of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
The death toll was more than 1,100.
2010: One island in the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, was also hit by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that instantly devastated dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: Aceh County of Pidie Jaya, Aceh, also suffered a shallow earthquake and resulted in destruction, as well as panic from people remembered with destruction as a result of deadly earthquakes and tsunamis in 2004.
Although this time there was no tsunami, more than 100 people died due to the collapse of the building.
2018: Lombok, dubbed a tourist island, also suffered a major earthquake that killed more than 500 people, most of which were on the north side of the island.
The quake detonated thousands of buildings and temporarily dumped thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, a former Alaskan governor and presidential deputy candidate, has been arrested on suspicion of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, blocking reports of domestic violence and fighting arrest efforts, as the release of the Alaska State Police report on Saturday.
According to police reports, when a woman’s acquaintance tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, she grabbed the woman’s phone.
Palin was handed over in Mat-Su Pretrial Prison, with a $500 unsecured fine, as reported by KTUU.
As the news network reported, Palin attended the trial on Saturday, declaring himself "innocent, confident" when asked about his defense.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could make him jailed for one year and fined $250,000.
In addition, he was also charged with Class B criminal charges, with one day's imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
For Palin, this is not the first time this criminal lawsuit has been filed.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His own mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to make a report on the alleged assault.
The case is currently being referred to the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was prosecuted for domestic violence, preventing reports of domestic violence criminal acts, and possession of firearms in a drunken state, which was also linked to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting on his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism from the veteran group for associating her son's violence with PTSD as a result of her duties during her time in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds of victims die
On Friday, Sulawesi Island in Indonesia was hit by a massive earthquake until at least 384 victims died.
An earthquake with a magnitude 7.5 Richter scale that potentially triggered a tsunami has detonated thousands of homes.
The power grid and communication connections are cut off, as well as the death toll is expected to continue to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake hit the central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos that show how terrible the moment of the disaster is spreading widely through social media.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu at the time, when the tsunami broke the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected terror attacks in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York attempted the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a terror attack in New York City, where eight people were killed -- the punishment included rare and has not been committed in federal crime-related states since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is suspected of carrying out an attack by hitting a truck he rented from the Home Depot to pedestrians and cyclists on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, in October.
In order to justify this death penalty, prosecutors must provide evidence that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injury, based on a statement of intent to drop the death penalty, which was submitted to the Southern District of New York.
Based on court documents, then the two charges allow for the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury seized Saipov with 22 charges, including eight counts of murder in launching extortion, which federal prosecutors typically use in cases of organized crime, as well as accusations of violent acts and attempts to destroy motor vehicles.
According to the prosecutor of the prosecution, the attack required "substantial planning and early ripening," as a depiction of Saipov's crime committed with "crazy, cruel, and savage."
Saidfullo Habibullahevic Saipov has resulted in injury, danger, and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza."
Five of the victims in the incident were tourists from Argentina.
Counting a decade since the Southern District of New York dropped the death penalty lawsuit for the last time.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes, accused of the murder of two drug suppliers, was eventually sentenced to life in prison.
The execution of the death penalty last time in New York federal court in 1953, was dropped on the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were found guilty in a espionage conspiracy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Based on court documents, Saipov, of Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse as the day and month went by after the attack.
When asked by investigators, he said that he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov also revealed to authorities that the attack he was carrying out was inspired by an ISIS video that was watched from his phone, as the contents of the indictment.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges brought against him.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, expressed "clearly disappointed" at the prosecutor's decision.
"In our view, the decision to execute death rather than accept a guilty plea for life imprisonment without bail would only prolong the trauma of the people involved in the incident," Patton said.
Previously, Saipov's defending team had appealed to the prosecutor not to drop the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE is responsible for Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage called for 'empowering the people's warriors' today in protest action at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians should "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics - because one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested to join the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative group supporter Peter Bone told street action in Birmingham that Britain "should be out" right now if Farage were to serve as Brexit Secretary.
However, the challenge facing May in reconciling his split position has been subjugated by supporters of the Remain Tories who joined in separate protest actions condemning Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan to stay on track even amid attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the European Union.
Allies stressed that he would be pushed forward to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite having a poor backlash - and forced Eurosceptics and Labour to decide the choice between his proposal package and 'disaster'.
Bone told the mass Leave Means Leave at Solihull that he wanted to 'remove the Chequers.
His suggestion, that Farage should appoint a colleague to be given responsibility in negotiations with Brussels.
"If the responsibility remains with him, we will be out now," he said.
MP Wellingborough added: "I'm ready to stand up for Brexit, but we need to get rid of the Chequers."
He said: "We are not fighting in a world war to be subdued.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone narrowed down the proposal that public opinion could potentially bring about changes since the 2016 vote: "The idea that states that the thinking of the British people has changed and wants a permanent condition, it's not at all true."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who was also involved in the mass action, told reporters: “Simply, I want to say: O Prime Minister, listen to your people.
"Chequers are not popular among the general public, whereas the Opposition will not vote for them, because they are not popular with our party and our activists who are really down the road and make us elected in the first place.
Our application, remove the Chequers and start listening to us."
Through a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Minister maintains their work when their promises are sincere."
Farage said that political demonstrations should be created in order to "feel the heat" if they want to deny the 2016 referendum decision.
“The most valuable thing right now is the trust between us – the people – and our political groups,” he said.
"They're trying to deny Brexit and here we are today, affirming to them that 'we're not going to let you do that.'
He added in a message to an enthusiastic crowd: “I want you to make our politicians, who are preparing to deny Brexit, also feel the heat.
“We are moving the people of this country who will win us in Brexit and will never give up until the independent, self-governing, and proud UK comes into being.”
Meanwhile, the mass of Remainers moved through Birmingham before taking action in the city centre for two hours.
The line of activists appeared to be flying the Tories Against Brexit banner after sparking its lineup this weekend.
A colleague in the Labour line, Lord Adonis, appealed to the Conservative group regarding the security issues of their party's application as the conference opened.
“These people are telling us that they can master the IT system and all the technology for Canada, whatever, for an anti-frozen border, in an unrestricted free trade in Ireland,” he said.
“It’s a funny show.
“There is no good Brexit at all,” he said.
Warren plans to make a ‘serious breakup’ in presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "break up the presidential nomination" after the election moment in November.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic party declared its future at a town hall in western Massachusetts, on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently denounced President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against the state GOP representative, Geoff Diehl, the deputy chairman of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
In national speculation, he was already branded as an opponent of Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon meeting in Holyoke was the 36th with its voters, which has been held in the format of the town hall since Trump took office.
A participant asked him if there was a plan to run for president.
Warren replied, that it was "the right time for women to enter the circle of Washington in order to restore our corrupt government, and that included the time when women were at the top."
Arrested Sims shooter, LSU player
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced the arrest of a suspected shooter leading to the death of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m. in the ET press conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, where an identified man asked for help as seen in the footage.
On Friday morning, 20-year-old Sims was shot and found dead near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died," Murphy J. Paul, chief of police, told the media on Saturday, via 247sports.
Wayde then wanted to protect his friend and Simpson released a shot at him.
While being interrogated, Simpson claims to be at the scene of the incident, holding a firearm, and shooting him towards the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without meaningful resistance and was incarcerated in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A junior player with a height of 6 feet 6 inches, growing up in Baton Rouge, that's the figure of the Sims, has played in 32 games with 10 predictions last season and an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds in each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team admits victory over Sebastian Vettel
Everything became clear when Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton in a qualifying event on Saturday that would carry Mercedes team orders had a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good starting position and almost left Hamilton as he retained his position in the first two laps and drew Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel became the first to drive into the pit and let Hamilton move into the density at the end of the crowd, something that should be very decisive.
Mercedes entered the pit one lap later and exited after Vettel, but Hamilton continued to drive after several chases that showed Ferrari's driver's reluctance to leave the inside blank with the risk of surviving after a double move to survive in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started the start in the back row of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race because he held the tyre change to target a quick finish and took over Kimi Raikkonen's position for fourth position.
He eventually entered the pit in the 44th lap but was unable to improve his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen eventually took fourth place.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and a real man left me.
The team has done an incredible job of having one or two," Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday through his insistence, he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about the sexual violence against future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly deliver a statement delivered by Ford in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, rather than commenting on what was going on in the Senate showing people who were "evil and mean and dishonest."
"Something that can happen and beautiful things that have been happening for the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry and evil people, and whores, and whores," he said.
"When you saw the outfit and the leak then they said, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you leaking it?
Remember the answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not leaking it."
All right, hold on a second.
What we're leaking...No, we're not leaking it," he added, as a senator's impression.
Feinstein had sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford last July, and it had leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein charged the leak not originating from his office.
"I'm not hiding Dr. Ford's allegations, I'm not leaking the story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as secret as his request."
But his refusal seemed unapproved by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: "I'll tell you, it's a really bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the prospective Supreme Judge, who became accused of sexual abuse of three women, the president was impressed by the Democrats' assumption of using charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take over power in a variety of ways.
You see crime, gossip, they don't care who they hurt, they have to walk for power and oversight," the president said in a statement.
League Elite: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants while facing Dundee
Dundee Stars recovered the loss on Friday in the Elite League as they battled the Belfast Giants by winning the home game with a score of 5-3 on Saturday.
Giant got a two-goal lead first after two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the hosts in balance before Dwyer returned the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised the position for Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season experienced by the Adam Keefe people, who managed to chase backward and finally excelled to be able to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, with three Giants wins in the previous match.
The opener from Dwyer was present in the fourth minute at 3:35 of a pass given by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford giving a pass when Beauvillier managed to double the lead four minutes later.
In the tight opening period, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the passer-by for the balancer that Cownie did at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead at the first break time when he missed his second night goal at the end of the first period.
The hosts reunited and Bouchard once again balanced their position with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee an advantage for the first time at the end of the game in the second period and he secured a win with his team in the middle of the fifth during the final period.
The Giants, who have so far suffered four defeats from their five games, were at home to face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Driver Dies to Ensure Hundreds of Passengers In Plane Safe From Earthquake
An air traffic driver in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after his death while ensuring the plane carrying hundreds of passengers could fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others have disappeared after a major earthquake struck the Sulawesi islands on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
A powerful follow-up earthquake continued to shake the region and many were trapped in the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their safety, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan the Great refused to leave his post in a heavily rocked driver's tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, Palu.
He chose to survive to ensure the Batik Air Flight number 6321, which at the time was on the runway, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the traffic driver's tower as he felt the tower began to collapse.
He died after that in the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesia's Aviation Navigation Service Authority, Yohannes Sirait, said his decision could save hundreds of lives, reports ABC Australia news.
We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter managed to reach Palu.
"We're all sad to hear this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities worried dead victims could reach thousands after the National Disaster Response Agency delivered access to the city of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong difficult.
"The casualties are believed to continue to increase as many bodies of victims are still being crushed and many others are not reachable," national disaster response agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves reaching six meters have made the Palu pass the scaffold which led to mass burials on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft brought assistance and a variety of supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries a corpse.
Clean water is rare.
Minimarkets everywhere are looted"
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors but we don’t know what they will find there.
It has been a tragedy, but it may be getting worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and asked the Indonesian national army: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation-related tasks.
Ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia earlier this year was also hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Water Niugini delivers one person missing after a lagoon plane crash
The airline operates a flight that fell to the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia delivering one person has disappeared, after previously being delivered to 47 passengers and crew have been evacuated safely from the sinking aircraft.
Water Niugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it was unable to identify a male passenger.
The airline said it had cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to find the man.
The airline does not respond quickly to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crews, after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline delivered the remaining six passengers to the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
What caused the accident and the complete sequence of events is still unclear.
Both U.S. airlines and navy said the plane landed in the lagoon around the runway.
Some eyewitnesses felt the plane was beyond the runway.
U.S. citizen passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came very low.
“That’s a really good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to channel the water as high as the waist through the emergency exit on the sinking aircraft.
He delivered the flight attendants panicking and screaming, and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said fishermen working close to the repaired docks also helped rescue using a rubber boat to transport people to land before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) in the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate 111 people have died in a PNG-registered airline crash over the past two decades but none involving Air Niugini.
Analysts release women's nighttime time line that burned alive
The charge of detention of things that took place on Saturday in the re-examination of a man accused of conducting a live-fire against a Mississippi woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He made a big line for the jury on how he used cell phone recordings to gather the various moves made by the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was in one location with Chambers on the night of his death, rather than inverted by the defendant's earlier statement, Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed the accused's cell phone was in one location with Chambers during that time, he argued that he was at the time with his friend Michael Sanford, the police finally asked for an explanation from Sanford.
Sanford attended the trial on Saturday and he testified that he was not in town on the day of the incident.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was being honest when he said that he was in Sanford's truck on the night of the incident, Sanford said he was "lies, because my truck is in Nashville."
Another inconsistency conveyed by Tellis was his statement that he knew Chambers about two weeks before the death of the victim.
Cell phone records indicate they get to know each other within a week.
Rowlett reports that after Chambers' death, Tellis sometimes removes Chambers' messages, calls and contacts from his phone.
"He removed the victim from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing statement on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would lead to the jury after that day.
The High Breed: What is the spirit of hip hop?
A group of hip hop trio want to challenge the negative views of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, who hails from Bristol, claims the hip hop movement is far from the origin of political messages and mutters social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make the hip hop spirit popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK through several artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
The other black man?!
NY bailiff sues couple for assault after issuing "racialist" message
A New York caregiver sues one couple for having discriminatoryly attacked after receiving an indirect message from a complaining mother and stating that she is "another black person."
The couple refused if they were considered racist, and considered it more like "straightening."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed her concern when she realized that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"I don't want to hurt anyone else," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she instead sent her to Miss Maurice, twice.
After realizing his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Maurice, stating that they had removed a caregiver, who was an African-American mixed citizen, for having done a nasty job and he expected more Filipinos, based on the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day of work and then returned using Uber.
Currently, Maurice demands the couple to compensate for the dismissal, and asks for compensation of about $350 a day for a six-month period, in exchange for the caregiver's job losses that he must initially work for, even without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do something like that," he told the Post on Sunday, then added "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple opposed claims that they were racist, stating that the fired Maurice was a justified thing to do, they were worried they could not believe it after offending him,
“My wife has sent me something she didn’t mean.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"But can you let your children be treated by someone you've cheated on, even if it's just a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
As wrapped in a "crush," Plasco said his wife had just given birth to her baby two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"You're going to chase someone who's in such a condition?
That's not a good thing to do," the investment banker added.
While the legal case is still going on, public opinion courts have made quick accusations against the couple on social media, blaming them for their attitude and logic.
Paddington publisher worries readers won't be in touch with bear talk, new newspaper revealed
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born not long after her book had been accepted, was explained in the letter. "It's very difficult to just talk without knowing the position she was in, reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's funny to know as we know about Paddington's great success."
Saying his father, who was a BBC cameraman before inspired through the writing of a children's book with a toy of bears, who was very optimistic about the results of his work that had been rejected, he added the anniversary of the publication of the 60th book that felt "sweet" after his father's death last year.
For Paddington, whom he described as "a very important member of our family," he added his father was quite proud of the end of his success.
"He's a pretty quiet person, and he's not a proud person," he said.
“But because Paddington means so much to him, it’s like you have a child who has achieved something: you’re proud of them even though not your entire endeavor.
I think he sees Paddington's success as such.
Although it was a result of his creation and imagination, he always gave praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye to her by phone.
By the time he landed, his daughter was immediately taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, but the doctors failed to save him.
"Nad made a calm call to convey it was really bad. that he was most likely not going to survive," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I got a call from Nad who said he was going to die within two minutes and he asked me to say goodbye to him.
And I did too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you.
Medications that doctors have given to keep her heart beating slowly go away and leave her body system.
He had died some time after the treatment process took place and everything felt deadly.
I could just sit there and wait, understand all this has been revealed.
I can’t hug, or scream or cry because I’m in a situation surrounded by family and people.
I really have to hold on to it all.”
Finally Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, currently grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - unaware of what had been going through her.
“No one knows,” he said.
"My head was covered in mud and my tears kept dripping all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but in that flight I felt such a deep sympathy for Nad.
That he needs love and understanding from me.
I know how much he loves her.”
Women who are mourning posting cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost a loved one try to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a bridge in Welsh with inspirational messages and contactable numbers to get support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to feel the way I feel every day,” he said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a slender smile.
“Everyone knows him from his smile.
They always say that her smile illuminates the atmosphere."
But, he stopped working before he died, as he "was in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that there will be a lasting effect."
Mrs. Davis made those cards, "to tell people that there's someone else out there that you can hug and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit down and sit down - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been friends with Mrs. Davies for many years, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say if he felt sad or depressed or anything," he said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed there was a change in his behavior.
He was at his lowest point on Christmas Day – when the kids opened their presents he didn’t look into their eyes or anything.”
He said his death was a big trauma to them, but they had to go through it: "It made a hole in the family.
It separates us.
But we have to go through it and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in uncertainty as the FBI begins its investigation
"I think, if we really get something like what he's asking for -- an investigation that's limited in time, limited in scope -- we might be able to bring a little unity," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "destroyed" amid the council's decision-making stalemate.
Why does Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their limitations are all due to time.
The legislative election stayed for another five weeks, on November 6 – if, as expected, the Republicans did poorly, they would become very weak in their chances of making the people they wanted to be elected to sit in the highest court there.
George W. Bush had contacted the Senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through it met with his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI made the report?
There will be elections in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes between the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to determine the winner and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors ‘anchored’ below Kim
The number of people fleeing from North Korea to South Korea has dropped dramatically since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a member of the U.S. parliament said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's union ministry, said there were 1,127 defections last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
Most defectors from the North were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still in the war - have increased dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on delayed denuclearization negotiations.
This comes after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to cooperate on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of development since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in that situation, it is unlikely that we will drop our weapons unilaterally," Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi accuses Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical," saying he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Opposition Party chairman Nancy Pelosi accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of being "hysterical" and said he did not suit temperamentally to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman performs like that, they’ll say ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Judicial Council Commission on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, a few times almost screaming and difficulty speaking when discussing about his family and his years during high school.
He also jokingly denounced Democrats on the committee, saying the charges against him were "unreasonable and coordinated character killings" organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and with his attitude towards Clinton and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected if he would try to charge if he was approved, and if Democrats got more votes in the House of Representatives.
"I would say like this -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. High Court.
Pelosi added that he was as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decision to the Health Services Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was seen as an adherent of conservative justice.
In the appointment hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for someone who is hysterical and biased to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that great,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
It was an ethical leak, a rage for months and years, and he couldn’t get it out without crying.
“We cried when we were angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, how do you think?"
He continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who said that she was also crying when she was angry, but developing a technique that meant that she was angry and starting to cry, she would say to the person who was talking to her, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he continued.
And I think it's brilliant."
Tears are released as a way out of anger partly because he is basically misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of early work, in a man-dominated office, when I was crying with unexpressed anger, was my neck gripped by an older woman—a cold manager who was always a little afraid—who dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you’re sad and will be happy because they think they’re successful.”
Patricia Schroeder, who is a Colorado congressman, once worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an affair outside of marriage on a boat called Monkey Business and resigned from the election, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, understood that there was no reason for him not to run for president.
"It's not a decision that's maturely thought out," he told me laughing 30 years later.
"There are already seven other candidates in the election, and the last thing they need is a new candidate.
Someone called her "The Snow Princess and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since it was too late in the campaign, he was left in fundraising, and so he vowed he would not run unless he managed to raise $2 million.
It was a fight that led to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to the man only gave him $250.
"Do they think I got a discount?" he asked.
As he spoke announcing that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was overly dominated by emotion — a sense of gratitude to the people who supported him, frustration with the system that made fundraising so difficult and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism — making him difficult to talk.
"You'd probably think that I was too nervous," recalled Miss Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
“You would think that Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember, thinking, what would they write in my niche?
"He's crying?"
How U.S.-China trade competition might be good for Beijing
The opening of trade competition between the U.S. and China is so heartbreaking, and while the fight is still far from over, the gap between the two countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by imposing a tax on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
A very significant increase was imposed starting this week with a new tariff affecting $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods entering the U.S. through China.
Beijing has responded each time, recently imposing a tariff of five to ten percent on goods worth $60 billion.
China has asked to equalize the US one-by-one, and the world's second-largest economy will not change in the near future.
Asking Washington to step down means following the will, but publicly succumbing to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards correctly, the pressure of U.S. trade competition can positively support China in the long run by reducing dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that quick political decisions by Washington or Beijing can make conditions that trigger economic movements in both countries actually more dangerous than what observers have known before,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia in the Center for New American Security, an expert body.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria said it was ready for a voluntary return of refugees and offered help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in his country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to progress in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government went on to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore it as it did again.
