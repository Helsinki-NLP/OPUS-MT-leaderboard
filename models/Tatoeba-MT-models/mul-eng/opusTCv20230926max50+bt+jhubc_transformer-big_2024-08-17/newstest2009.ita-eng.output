The Prague Stock Exchange at the closing of the market had a negative collapse.
After the morning collapse, the Prague Stock Exchange restored the losses.
Transactions in CEZ shares have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the day’s collapse before it was almost 6%.
Behind this downside is the stock crash on Wall Street.
Thus, also from us, there is a market reaction to the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which has refused to support the stabilization plan of the local financial sector.
Collapse of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, Asian Stock Exchange stocks experienced a dramatic collapse, although the indices, however, during the day later cancelled a portion of the losses.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange’s Hang Seng index during the day cleared almost 4%, but later also a share of losses stabilizing to 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but in the end losses settled at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
“The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong’s Currency Office.
Hong Kong, despite being a part of China, handles financial policy on its own, without depending on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will suffer the consequences as well.
U.S.-led strike
The US Parliament on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which $700 billion (almost 12 trillion Czech crowns) were to be allocated.
The lawmakers ignored President Bush’s call to back the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks on Monday experienced a strike and major stock indices have seen the biggest collapse in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost 7% and a similar size collapse was last observed in 1987.
The index was already declining before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it went into free fall.
Congress has ceded: the U.S. government can extend $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of economic support agreement for the U.S. financial system.
The vote on this will be held at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers broke the ice in the rescue plan's approval dialogue in the form of economic aid to the U.S. financial system for a total of $700 million (nearly 12 trillion crowns).
But it hasn't been said yet.
Representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting it.
The support plan for the financial system will be discussed on Monday on the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday, he told Reuters, the chairman of the chamber’s banking and financial services committee, Barney Frank.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economists, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening the financial markets.
However, later on, we will have the return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, market aid can be achieved.
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
“We’ve taken a big step forward.”
“We have clarified our different views on the way the package is presented for market stabilization,” Democratic Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to the same, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Legislators’ delegates met on the night of Saturday and Sunday with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give definitive form to the government’s financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-cashable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead financial companies to serious losses and put at risk the stability of the entire system.
“We are in compliance with the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.”
“It’s still necessary to carry out the recovery plan, but I think we are,” Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis falls heavily on stock markets that are collapsing sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are thus trying to reach a final agreement in Congress even before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trade in Asian financial markets, which are, in the order of time, the first to influence the market on Monday following the decision of Congress.
But for now it’s definitely not clear when the two U.S. congressional chambers will vote on the law and even if negotiations can stop at the last minute on some issues.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount provided for system support must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has requested.
But Congress can block the allocation of the rest of the sum in case it has the impression that the program does not perform its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the 350 finals.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Although the President may veto this decision, Congress may override his right to veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thought of the program has remained, that is to say, getting the finances to buy the passive mortgage values, the price of which has fallen because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
“We worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," the Republican senator said.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush is satisfied with Saturday’s positive performance and appreciates “the effort of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of gold parachute
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the top spokesman, said lawmakers have agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing the budget for reductions, splitting the financial plan.
The new law must also limit the so-called gold parachute for the executives of the companies participating in the program and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard and have taken a big step forward towards an agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and also for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan relies on the help of homeowners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage rates it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly expenses on rates for debtors and will allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance’s chief economist, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
“And that’s because we don’t know how and for what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for how the losses between them will divide the financial sector and the government," Marek told the iHNed.cz website.
Whether the plan will be approved now or at the beginning of next week is not so fundamental, according to Marek.
More importantly, it is that already this week the representatives of the Congress find an agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological meaning of this agreement that will be approved is more important at this time,” Marek said.
Duel to the Last Blood: MP3 Players Against Cell Phones
We will advise how to choose
While almost every cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
From this it is clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons why you should buy an autonomous reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you will hardly buy a high-quality expensive turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this either.
But if your shelves are filled with hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyls, you probably dream of a turntable like that.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for a reader 8,000 crowns, as well as a fan of the Pink Floyd perhaps hardly digests the twenty-crown headphones on the market.
Two extremes among which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The duration of the batteries is to be decided.
Some high-quality music players manage to do much more than just read music, but they don’t even make phones by mistake.
There is no other current device as universal as the cell phone.
Next to primary functions, phone and text, you can read music and video, record both and have a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe even navigate.
And if we take into account smartphones and palm trees you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle because no refrigerator can make the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the cell phone also brings disadvantages.
More functions you use on your phone and first the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
Reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few mobile phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music readers (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As for cheap mobile phones, don’t count that they can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, get another charger to work for safety, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won’t have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst last at least 9 hours of continuous functionality with a charge.
Another problem occurs when you download music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately only a limited part of the devices has the universal USB port and in addition, not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Of course the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do so without an adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except for some exceptions (ipods) do not need any special software.
Simply fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create themselves a multimedia library ordered by the names of the performers, the name of the album, genre, or by user classification.
Some devices only reproduce the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, be especially interested in the battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and clearly the ease of use.
If you need music especially from the background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram you just need a mobile phone any that reads MP3.
This can be done now, clearly on any cell phone.
You don’t have to worry too much about what formats your phone or reader recognizes.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most popular, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
It is less the AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic to buy a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the supply of operators is poor and is usually limited only to the hit of the radio moment.
The prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this mode of selling music (either via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phone behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to something in their pocket while the MP3 player remains forgotten at home.
However, it also depends on this, if you always carry behind the headphones or at least the wireless headset.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small part of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3 thousand crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for the common headphones.
The best and most technically equipped mobile phones and even with the 3.5 mm socket for the common headphones, cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead, the advantage of readers is, among other things, easy handling.
The simplest not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice) is really done by anyone to handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of the handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally hitting the start of the mobile internet and as a result of a giant ticket for data transmission.
What equipment to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, return in the 2 000 kroons.
But be careful
The base models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones do this with 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, you should preferably take the specialized mobile phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual MP3 keys and the convenience of the service so you approach the same MP3 player.
In this regard, Sony Ericsson has made several roads, which mobile phones of the walkman line have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands provide you with the same service and the same price category up to 4,000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (usually 15 hours, in line up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Maybe
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all the services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, there is something missing – a virtual operator that forces traditional operators to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
The fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive in Europe we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
In the end, it was also confirmed by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, who noted that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in regulating roaming rates, perhaps a paradoxical situation will be created - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to start the fight.
Perhaps it sounds absurd, as we have three mobile networks and coverage well above 100%.
On the other hand, mobile telephony operators like to get tired of the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>) Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k often emphasises that in the past he has sometimes expressed that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network no longer likely has many possibilities. (Otherwise, it might be difficult to find other frequencies now).
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry into the market of virtual operators that has led to a significant drop in prices, to which then traditional operators would have to react.
At the same time, even before sharks like Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, similar voices resonated in Britain as we did.
It has been shown, however, that the place for such operators is there and that they can be really successful.
At the end of the day, we don’t have to go very far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year this operator has managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time behind Mobilking lies the Penta financial group to which in the Czech Republic belongs, among other things, the U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
In order to actually function, it is enough for many fewer customers than for a traditional operator.
They do not carry behind, that is to say, relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world, virtual operators usually present themselves at low cost, they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the offer of the most restricted services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS that cost at least half as much as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move even betting on a target group not recently.
This operator aims to say specifically about men.
“Real men choose a mobileking operator that they like and can be trusted with,” says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can affirm a similar concept as in Poland.
Vodafone press spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of services it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic there is no possibility, mobile network operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there will ever be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not have much expectation.
Mobilking’s surge will happen rather in the other countries of our area,” Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, the spokesman for the Penta financial group, told Mobile.cz.
Thus, he indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very much in favour of this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything because they don’t create any potential competitors.
For a while, it has not hidden its interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novara group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And it's better before you do it.
We have repeatedly negotiated on this possibility with all Czech mobile network operators.
We have already been able to make progress in negotiations with some of them,” said Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe there will be better times.
From unofficial information it turns out that the first virtual operator will probably have to have it by the end of the year.
For now, however, a impenetrable wall of silence stands around its creation.
“At the moment we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a fully qualified virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far, no one with a complex and serious project has addressed us," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of the Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nika O2 press section said in his statement to Mobil.cz.
The other operators also rely on the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobil press spokesman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "For now, we have not noticed any vital and advantageous commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue to build."
He adds: “In the T-Mobile network, a virtual operator will hardly appear by the end of the year.
At this point we would have already had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on achieving its 3G license requirements.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to negotiations by potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
We consider this, from the customer’s point of view, the most productive.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Competent authorities - with complicit operators
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profit.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The annoyances surrounding the U:fon creation testify that when the operators hold on to something they know how to rest on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure is pressing against <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> during the period of creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by public access information from the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> web pages.
But right now U:fon serves as a topic for which you do not accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> noted: “The environment of the mobile phone market competition has been little further enhanced with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Regarding the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that another competitor’s entry would place high demands on him and especially on his services.”
However, the attitude of mobile operators is quite surprising the complete disinterest on the part of the Czech regulators.
It is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> that unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, in relation to the whole problem has taken its typical position.
"The entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract of rental of the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator has been realized.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers was probably not interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa, of the Section for External Relations <0xC3><0x9A>OHS, in response to our question.
Such a statement made by the representatives of the operators may not be surprising.
Instead, by the office which must defend the interests of consumers and, above all, deal with the fact that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, it is more than a delicate business.
Especially when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "Outside where virtual operators commonly work, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
But, of course, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Truly shocking throughout the situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence, you ask yourself.
Equally as the ‘same price of petrol for all petrol stations is undoubtedly the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
"The section has found no signs of anti-competitive behavior regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it has no corresponding greater responsibility for its market behavior.
The unnecessary tools for the opening of the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecoms regulator," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets drawn up by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of economic competition as the only market.
In such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always unnecessary the agreement of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has – at the end of the accounts logically – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not accept this argument, for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS it should be an alarming minimum that three mobile operators behave in such a strangely similar way.
At the same time, complaints by the parties concerned (including the aforementioned GTS Novera company) show that during negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS is kept out of the whole thing.
We have already found this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>'s rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved telecommunications law was updated, despite the fact that, from this, many experts expected the situation to improve.
This is something the representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS need to know more than well, but perhaps their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it when no one is watching
While we do not realize it, the operation of these pseudo-virtual operators remains, of which there are even some in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their own price lists of mobile phone services that are only partially public.
These are usually companies that deal with multi-level marketing.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their mobile services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only pre-established people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company faces the operator as a classic corporate customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer you then receive special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar pre-sale.
“If you present the cases you are talking about, which we will be interested in, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions, and it could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company,” said Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1>.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 companies mentioned can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends itself at the same time from such an attitude.
From the activity of these companies they take a non-indifferent profit and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns of possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it as the usual customers of mobile phone operators.”
But this should be a strange thing to the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
In addition, another question is opened for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has strong enough rights to expose similar activities and if it does not want to, it will not be necessary to satisfy the explanation of operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be more expensive
As has already been said in the text several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a significant decrease in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators were more or less trying to prevent their creation.
The topics they used were practically identical - too small market, too saturated limit, problems with the quality of services etc.
But in the developed countries, in these cases, the regulators have intervened in the defence not of mobile operators but of their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then you came to the creation of the first virtual operator and others joined him.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators throw themselves from one to the other all the time like a hot potato.
From our experience we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But let's not throw the sponge.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator will appear really soon from us, the Czech mobile market will get back on track.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it would hardly be possible for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain impassive to the refusal (discrimination) of the others concerned.
And perhaps we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek on the occasion of the Day of the recognition of the Czech State presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j".
The new recording of the hymn was made by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available – only with male or female voice, chorus step and instrumental edition.
The song is directed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the hymn are Otakar Jeremi<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
He previously told the radio "<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas" that he specifically chose to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I tried to take care that both and also the choir, have the clear sentence, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j" was first played in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original work Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl accompanied by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>krupa.
It has gained popularity and people have spontaneously made it theirs.
The first stanza of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remains one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
On Wednesday MHD Prague will also accompany you for the first time with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the metro, tram and bus will pick up the first passengers who will have an electronic card in their pocket instead of the paper ticket.
At this time it can be procured by about a hundred thousand people who own their own Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the 30 and 90 days and annual ticket (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have their card reloaded in the Infopoints and the offices of the Transport Company and at the metro stop Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Letan<0xC5><0x88>y, Ra<0xC4><0x8D>any, Ko<0xC5><0x88>any.
The cutlery can be purchased from yesterday on the Internet on the page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the service via the internet can completely forget about the gyms in the metro stops where they had to make long queues for paper tickets.
The cutting is purchased via the internet and on the Opencard it is uploaded to one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
“In these places, passengers have at their disposal a sport hall with staff trained that will help those interested in buying on the internet and will also register on their card the credit they have acquired,” said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the library you will be able to load the electronic clipboards on the ATM and self-service Opencards that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, similar to ticket obliterators and passengers have already noticed them at the stops of the metro Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"There are now five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> concluded.
The cutting will be checked instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and after payment of the cutting, it will load on top.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from number 300 to 499, that the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
“In the trains added to Prague’s integrated transports there are controllers equipped with card readers with which they verify the temporal and zonal validity,” explained the control mode of Filip’s tickets from the organization Ropid, which sets Prague’s public transport schedules.
Urban buses have card readers integrated into the driver’s box.
During the climb it is therefore unnecessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at the specified point next to the box.
Thus, the driver checks the validity of the loaded trims.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded trims, there is nothing easier than asking the driver this type of information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who take the city buses and will not remember, when the cutting expires, can again go to the self-service ATMs, where the cutters are loaded on paper.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the screen of the device.
The Sudeten Germans wanted a referendum from the US
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked to include <0xC5><0xA0>umava in the United States.
This results from the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, according to what is said, some German groups of the Sudeten turned in 1945 to the President of the United States.
This results above all from the letter kept in a private archive and now deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in the letter to the US president not to allow the return of the “<0xC5><0xA0>umava district” – occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement – to Czechoslovakia again.
“We understand the situation and want to be sure of the promises that American units will come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, “People who hold to the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava with all their heart.”
Because, they say, the annexation of Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Sudeten Germans hope only for brutality, lack of respect, misunderstanding, oppression and enslavement, the authors of the letter ask the American president to always take up the protege.
"We cannot believe that without regard to the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has not contributed to the victory of the Allies at all," the letter said.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst for revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States should doubt the conviction of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the district on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or to live under the rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem na<0xC3><0xAF>ve with our knowledge of the history of the post-war period, according to some witnesses it adequately describes the then expectations of the Germans of the Sudeten.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least insinuate that it was going to be their move from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the peoples of the Sudeten.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice in the maritime power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp at Hol<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n, dozens of other Czech Germans went to find him so that he could teach him Czech.
"These people believed that once you came home the Czech would make him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners, who lived in Czechoslovakia during the war, he said that on the basis of Bene<0xC5><0xA1>'s decrees they would have been moved from the Republic.
Don't think -you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so, one could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek is expected to discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The 150 million-dollar campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet but also on the flyers.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the effect of alcohol at the wheel.
And also remind him to put his belt on before he leaves.
He wants to touch in the consciousness above all young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and last but not least professional drivers.
What will it look like in the commercials?
Especially stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't think -you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is written capitalized on the plate.
And in a pool of blood there is the word "pay."
This should symbolize that a person can pay with his life at a time of distraction.
The commercials will "save" the viewers until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with drastic scenes of the victims of accidents.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrots and sticks for drivers
“The carotenoid and stick system works with the drivers.
The carrot for them is for example when they pass with red and so they save time.
The stick is the danger of the fine or the accident.
We need to remind drivers of the risk,” says Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n, a psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
And that’s why we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that warn drivers of danger are already less effective.
“If the fixed panel has been installed that warns of the danger, it will probably soon confuse itself with the environment and the drivers will no longer pay attention to it,” warns Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed his support for the return of virtually all occupied territories in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue that he published Monday, the newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will have a certain percentage of these territories but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (of Israeli areas), because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that any restitution would also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the cops or the spies to pass on him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the wake of the two attacks in July in the city, during which some people were killed and wounded.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places," which are within the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he added.
The retreat from the heights of Golan
Olmert has also spoken out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is the essential condition for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he said.
“The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the heights of Golan.
They will have to give up the current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to give up the permanent support, which they offer to Hamas terrorism, al-Qaida (the Shiite movement) (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the war)."
Questions After the Accident: Are Stewards Illegal on Buses?
The law doesn’t recognize them, you can’t walk on the bus that makes long distances
In the context of the tragic incident near the Italian city of Padua of the student agency bus company, the question came out if the stewards and passengers could move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to respect the laws strictly and formally, the activity of the steward is in conflict with the law of road traffic," said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The incident last week that killed a 22-year-old hostess was caused by a truck that cut the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the less safe place of the bus, although there were still two other seats assigned.
But the bus can make an accident or brake abruptly even at the time of distribution of coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether or not the bus is equipped with standing seats according to the circulation booklet.
If it is not approved, passengers must be seated.
Student Agency buses do not have standing places, the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura confirmed on the website Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x97>.cz.
“We assessed this with the Ministry and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
It was then revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the designated seat," he said.
The law does not recognize the steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with the regularization of this role.”
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from performing the services.
The road traffic law only recognizes the vehicle’s accompanying term, its rights and duties are not defined,” added spokesman Hanzelka.
On the other hand, the director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> believes that the law is quite concerned with this problem.
It depends on whether the bus has approved standing places.
All that," he says.
It categorizes buses into urban areas where there are places to stand and maximum speed limited, interurbans with places to stand with higher mass speed and long-distance without places to stand with maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert.
The expert BESIP on road safety Jaroslav Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n does not find the underlying problem in the movement of the stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet race there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on the planes.
It’s not even safe there when a turbulence arrives and the flight attendant can shake his head.”
"If the bus makes a sudden braking, of course, the laws of physics are worth it.
Same as in the city bus or on the tram.
The carrier company must solve the security of the stewards with an internal regulation," he says and also understands that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of stewards.
This one takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their profession dangerous.
“Not as soon as I get the feeling that I have to consider the job of the steward as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they leave.
They would also reduce costs,” he said.
Asiana director Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency, has motivated the absence of stewards on his means as an interest in security.
“We don’t have hostess, we’ve been opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz said less than a year ago.
There was a huge tragedy.
In the incident of the line for Naples died a young hostess from the region of Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably exited the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid it with a sudden maneuver, but hit him with the front right.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the stewarts were occupied.
"It is not possible to book these places in long-distance buses, they are inconceivable."
The company has in mind to report the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the court’s ruling to pay damages to the girl’s family, but a financial compensation is expected from the culprit.
The revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to clarification of the movement of Stewarts on board the buses.
“But they didn’t achieve any concrete results.
They don’t consider them as buses, they deal more with the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and cell phone use during driving,” says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of Stewarts to be a major threat to the safety of passengers,” concludes spokesman Havelka, who concluded that the safety control of buses is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf's hopes point to Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the director of the WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published Monday that could form "the center of the capital market of the financial group of savings banks" through the meeting of units of the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf banking institution with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
The West LB would launch a “competent block” with lasting profits in such a venture.
Moreover, such a union could be a decisive impetus for further ties in the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder banking sector.
This is how it is read, when a board of directors wants to demonstrate the ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB distress is still under heavy pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Service, having pointed out some time ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is looking for a future solution.
The links between the Deka-Bank, which the same clients of the Savings Banks already know because of their investment funds, and the WestLB has certainly been talking about it for quite some time, even from Frankfurt.
At the end of August, the head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas reported at the time of the first half of the year’s filing that a merger of the house at via Magonza with a national bank like Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the deka’s board of directors, which is half led by regional banks and savings fund consortia, has delegated the board to hold talks with the West LB on joint negotiations.
These could be market negotiations or parts of them.
However, as they say in business, the talks have just begun.
Deka-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is one of the most important in Frankfurt’s business district, not the first time when it comes to consolidating the economy.
In 2003 for a short period it seemed that the Deka-Bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate and Helaba.
Of this association three did not do anything about it.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Assia was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions have also proved incapable of reaching an agreement.
The regional bank of the Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg in Stuttgart.
Yet they have always thought of a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, chairman of Helaba’s board of directors, spoke out against design games to reunite with his home.
Apart from this, it seems that cognition is created, that it is necessary to bring the different homes of the public sector closer together.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg may first take place.
For Helaba, this is not good news at all.
If you increase the pressure for other mergers, as long as the partners are missing.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than the houses in Monaco and Stuttgart.
The Association of Assia-Turingia Savings Banks, which participates with 85 percent of Helaba, put the chain at the meeting with WestLB.
Only the NordLB would remain.
These geo-strategic reasoning is just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual houses are combined.
In June, Merl noted that the decisive question, with which business model the future of regional banks would be assured, would not yet be answered by the German Savings Banks Association.
In the end, the division of the West LB could also come out, which of course is not desirable on the part of the West LB.
Thus the letter of the board of directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
You will see how the reunification of the individual parts will work with the Deka-Bank.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to the Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says that everything is different.
Behind them next to the Kaiser brand’s 5L barrel stands a massive beard and shows the approximately 200 travelers what the deep tones it manages to produce from the throat.
Elena first gives Luca a pack and then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to the station of Porta Nuova, this evening at 23.45 four couriers with destination Monaco, Festa della Birra", arrival expected at 6.30.
Three couriers are reserved mainly for Italians, in another they travel only Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated during the night.
It’s so loud, says Marco, that it’s not for Italians.
Marco who wears a long coat with fake fur lining and a pair of glasses with silvery wide spikes belongs to him buses.
For 5 years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, this year there are 3 tours.
The evening departure, day to party, returns at 22.30.
Overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euros includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to the standards of Bavarian authenticity, the disease box and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave at the time of Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls on the bus, the passengers sleep.
Better yet, they will still need their strength.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with an Italian license plate on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as expected, Marco’s group arrives at 6.30 am at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others group together, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First: put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When they open the doors of the beer tent, it means running!", quotes Mark of the early morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the places at the bottom of the tent.
“Not in front of us, then we block, and not all yellow hats sitting on the same benches, divide into the right space!”
The mouthpiece costs 8.25 Euro, cries Marco.
And don’t forget to give your hand.
"Prove to the security service, that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they disappear!”
Third: "Tonight at 10.30 p.m. we meet again here!
He's already leaving for the party.
On the street one attacks as he follows the yellow hats to the trees, to the street signs and even to an advertising banner of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the holiday, known as "Italian weekend".
Exact data does not exist, we are talking about 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police of Monaco are reinforced with 7 agents from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where the Italians rank first with 200 medical care in front of the British (about 60 medical care) and the Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by the Italians is the curtain of the Hofbr<0xC3><0xA4>uhaus.
1. Insomnia Nights for Mortgage Real Estate Creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared by critical developments.
Because the crisis started on the weekend.
The real estate financier Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, receives a billion dollar loan from a consortium of German banks, in order to protect itself from market turbulence.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday, the support credits would reach up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate must only pay interest on the requested party.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
At the bottom are the losses of the affiliate Deffa.
The state financier according to a newspaper article has refinanced in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves had fallen by 95% to EUR 2.37 million, even the share of the capital just fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to 0 compared to last year, earnings from increases in both demand and certain shares as of the settlement of loan installments fell by more than 70% out of 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher incomes from the return of subordinated compensation costs that come both from the restructuring of the former Deffa group and from the repayment of interest according to the single text of tax laws and from the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was quite modest16%.
The former public financier after being privatized in 1990 had lost himself in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were seized at Aareal Bank.
Since income in classical state funding was too low, Deffa has engaged more in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private and state investors (PPPs) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate now has to amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group's profit and loss account.
The fact is that the dividends have been cancelled.
In 2007 they were reduced by 2/3.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Deffa is a major state and infrastructure financier.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market between banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have reliable deposits of customers.
Due to the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of loans between the banks largely dried up, because the banks accumulate liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate annually requires short-term refinancing for a portion of Deffa’s credit portfolio – about 50 billion – in the short term.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial need has been covered by credit for a certain period and the company protected by the influence of the mostly non-functioning international monetary markets.
From other sources it is felt, that thanks to the money the refinancing is insured until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the HRE group will not need monetary markets in a short time.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) are based on the fact that the commercial viability of the HRE Group is still assured.
This is expected for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
It is possible that the funding will not be fully used.
But the opposite is also not to be ruled out.
After Sunday evening the bank learned what it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the souls.
The share price falls 75% to 3.30 Euro.
The courses of the mortgages are quite good.
While anterior-grade debts appear almost immovable, they cede the courses of deferred credits.
Especially affected are the mortgages of the affiliate W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-Hypo understandably the proceeds with maturity beyond 2009.
Before HRE loans seemed like a speculative alternative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of banks and the institution itself, that with the defiance of the crisis happened, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as central banks, governments and less-damaged banks are still ready, you can count on an annuality amortization by the deadline.
Or it comes into operation, which nobody dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But with regard to the information raised due to partial stateizations, the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
Above all, it will create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision to split up from their commitments.
Short-term investors can conclude the postponement of losses for future compensatory tax payments on the surpluses.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is due to attend Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls begin to laugh: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-the new Exchange Log tells of Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
How excited I am.
I also had the nerve to go to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana High School.
I had to find her on my own and fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The beginning of the first lesson does not seem to have been fixed as well as by us in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive slowly from 8 a.m. until 8.40 a short conversation with the teacher, the so-called "home room", begins.
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of guy who talks willingly in front of people, in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn’t have the school uniform yet, I put on an old mother’s host skirt, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed like this I sat in front of the chair and tried to pronounce well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and celebrate my birthday in one week.
At that time I was very happy to have already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, ridiculed and made a sign and I continued to hear the word "Kawaii".
I've known her since my mangas.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary of Japanese girls to survive and means "sweet, sweet".
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl next to me sneezed, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the lesson time had continued quietly, but when the gong played, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
Everyone spoke disorderlyly and laughed and dried me with questions – then it’s really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, everyone opened their Bento.
My host mother also made me the basket for lunch- it's different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and a kind of wrappers with meat and tofu..
Truth be told, I don’t even know what exactly I eat in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new taste.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under salt, brrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a Bento made by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope then to make the acquaintance of the boy during recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm really curious if I can find out.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them that I would like to go to school in Japan for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me"
I have been reading Mangas for years now.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started to learn a little Japanese.
I was completely convinced to come back once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They hold us here a lot.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technologies and latest trends – on the other: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen in my life.”
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach escapes when they feel danger. Does that mean they also feel fear?
The neurologist Joseph Le Doux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
4. But how could it occur if, when they behave in our own way, they have our own feelings?
The Internet newspaper "Edge" has been publishing articles of well-known scientists for several years.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove it, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or consciousness in general, we enter an impracticable territory, because the reference base does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, he does the same things that other animals do, that is, he pretends to be dead, escapes or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to transmit our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected with human consciousness, the associated circuits (this for its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this wide area is much more developed than in the other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely lacking.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the basis is thus admitted on the assumption that man differs even from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should be presented in the way of talking about man: since a large part of life is connected to language, it is often said to be connected to consciousness.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
Although awareness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the animal’s awareness, as it is done, is certainly very different from the circumstances of our consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through your own experience because of the special hardware, their research will cause us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which it would be easier for science to access.
You could analyze the processes of animal consciousness without regard to their contents, and this is exactly what happens in studies of the short memory of primates, particularly in the example of visualization.
Therefore, for this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, passes first to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of the visualization.
So, what does it mean for feelings?
I charge them with the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) occupies the working memory.
Seen in this way the feelings are closely connected to the regions of the cortex, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With speaking nature subtle nuances of hearing are created, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Compared to this, for example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings result from more primitive activities of the body regions of the sensations of the cortex and the head paleo, similar to Jack Pankseep, who nevertheless focused more on the paleocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict it, but I find it unproven.
Pankseep brings up arguments that what appears to rats and humans as fear, probably comes to mind in both cases: but how could it occur, if rats and humans experience the same thing when behaving in a similar way?
A cockroach in case of danger flees as if he too felt fear?
In my eyes, the simple similarity of behavior cannot yet prove any vital similarity.
And that is, the neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and humans have similar paleoencephalities, cockroaches not even a brain.
But is paleoencephalitis responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove it for humans, how would you want to prove it on rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, here there are progress at the neural level, as long as you give up the same procedure on rats and men.
As I don’t do research on language and consciousness in rats, so I don’t do it about their emotions, I don’t even know if they exist.
This may be considered myopic, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continually bumping against a wall.
I am an emotional practical person.
The President of UEFA Platini: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
“The government sees UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europeans with Poland,” Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
Both the host countries slid into the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stadiums to be used by Europeans will even be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
Now we have to work at the highest speed," Ukrainian association president Grigorij Surkis said.
"Uefa will keep an eye on us all the time."
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After several scandals the leadership of the Polish PZPN association was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP news agency.
“In a letter, we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparations for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer.”
Numerous first division players were only convicted of manipulation in the last season, and in the end they had to postpone the start of the League at the last moment.
Dennis Quaid rebate outraged
He wanted to promote a new film, in an interview he talked about the private and now he has issues with the former: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared his ex Dennis Quaid an adulterer.
He froze in anger and rebuttal.
The War of the Roses has been delayed for former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors are now arguing with each other about a bad dispute – in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week for the first time said of the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the betrayals she would have come to know only after the separation.
The occasion for the "spoiler of the soul" was the work with Ryan's press for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his publicly declared adultery husband was clear: he would be “inaudible,” the fifty-four-year-old told the “New York Daily News,” that “Meg for the next time repeats and reworks the story of our relationship.”
It would also be "deplorable" that Jack, the sixteen-year-old son they had together, again "remember publicly the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan lives alone, Quaid is married again and soon becomes the father of twins.
And so his judgments close with the arrow: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best.”
Prices are for airline tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper
Flights and overnight stays in the hotel have again become more affordable - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after a price increase in the first quarter it observed a noticeable decline in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed still average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already at 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees this as the reason for the weak dollar quote, which would lead to a "hot desire to travel by American tourists"
Financial centers such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the hotel price recession in a stronger way than industrial centers such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with an increase of 26.3% even hold the record in Europe
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend in the first quarter still points up:
Due to the abundance of kerosene, Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights would even be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, Economy Class air ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but in the first class and business price changes were much weaker.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11.9% and fell by 23.6% in the second quarter.
As for domestic German flights, according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the price collapse would be on the one hand the economic growth down, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air travel market has declined.
On the other hand, there would be an agreement on open skies, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe, increasing competition pressure.
A sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of non-profit routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared a failure – in Europe alone it was 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburg’s SV becomes a capitol.
At Borussia Luhukay still can't find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the landing of luck for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player entered the game first of all late and failed with a shot on the cross
His message was formulated with precision, he passed it on his lips in a convincing way.
He knew he was absolutely right.
“We need a second goal,” said Hermann Rieger in the Hamburg arena’s cabin corridor.
It didn’t happen much in the catacombs, the game break was over and most sat back in their place.
Rieger has been a physiotherapist of HSV for almost 3 decades, enjoys an even greater estimate of certain old players.
And so his warning also found listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol has annihilated and raised his thumb for approval.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach of the Hamburg Martin Jol.
His order must have played in a similar way: here's the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
“Not everything was nice to see here today,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt, too, would have been “more relaxed.”
For the 1 to zero those of Hamburg must thank the header that went to sign Mladen Petric (11) and the fact that many of Gladbach's weak players could not have hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
“It was a dirty victory,” said Martin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg this Monday will turn 121 years old.
The spectators have already celebrated, on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which has legitimized their sports company as before the class.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We are able to put everything in order,” said Marcell Jansen.
He is aware that the provisional certificate from the table is more indicative of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its new late hired arrivals – the Brazilian Neves und Silva, the defender of the door Petric as well as Jansen blown to FC Bayern – finds itself slowly, but has not yet managed to shine.
“We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling,” Jol relaunches.
After the defeat of the vote
There is fear on Wall Street.
The first news of the rescue package’s failure caused the 700-point Dow Jones to temporarily collapse.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in his history.
Later, the Down came back a little later.
At about 20:30 the world’s most important stock market barometer has quoted/recognised with a good 5% in cash on 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was firm with a deficit of more than 7% out of 1548 points
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which returned us just 14%, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could do that.
The shares of Goldman Sachs bank have yielded just 10%.
Only a few days before the great investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the venture.
Within the scope of the rescue plan, the financial funds had to be allocated for the seizure of the so-called mortgage documents.
However, the sum must be paid not in a single shot, but by degrees.
As a result, the State had to maintain the Aktienoptionsscheine of financial companies, which could be redeemed with an adequate rate of quotations, to reduce the debt for the state's cash registers.

Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has created perplexity among scientists: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the rapid-freezing fuel pipes, it is now up to her to die for freezing.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates disintegration – the anomaly of the/or Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum/spin/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example, Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical record as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
What has surprised scientists for years: rockets don’t behave as expected under the law of gravitation.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
Until now, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year was renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, might not be entirely accurate.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes that before Einstein was wrong, he tries to explain the anomaly of the Swing-by by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have observed in the cosmos.
"He who is responsible for the anomaly could be the dark matter that could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for about 10 years.
From her obviously comes out a force of attraction, whose effect on the other celestial bodies is shown.
Instead, she herself is completely invisible, i.e. she does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation of her kind, especially any visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter constitutes at least a good fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt would again be free, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had asked for several million euros in ransom.
In a shootout prior to the release, 6 kidnappers were found to have been killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations for the bailout are already underway.
The Germans are always in the sights of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24's report: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are examining their state of health," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 components of an expedition in the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting that took place before the hostages were released remains unclear, so the kidnappers after the instructions of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them by surprise.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the official said.
It would be "still only a matter of taking hostages", when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had killed six of the kidnappers and captured two of them by gunfire.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of hostages would be delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women in custody after the ransom was paid.
The men would have to stay in detention until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo has refused to take a position on the report.
The abuses of the fatherland "led to suicide"
Years of abuse by the father-in-law have led a woman to kill herself, a court has said.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, has been in prison for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly molested his daughter Stephanie Randle when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Mrs. Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise molested her and hugged her before having sex, while her mother was out to work in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who had spent a long time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Minister of Public Affairs Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle’s friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were “emotionally dead,” and had “wet with life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She is thought to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle consoled his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended up saying, "I tied her up and bound her."
“I didn’t molest her sexually.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "She's an extremely strange fetishist, and for her victim it must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his life away.
Even harder is the fact that if he had not done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to end before the court.”
I am aware of the effects that Stephanie’s father and mother describe having had on their daughter during these years.
“Otherwise it was clearly likely that she had been a promising and happy successful young woman.”
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office officer who left the top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC said.
The man was on his way from the Department of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were transferred to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least sensitive of the accusations made under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
“They would have thought that this was treated internally at the Mod and the Office of Cabinet,” he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, is to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause relating to the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The lost documents contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the B&B account
British construction companies could face an account of over <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the bailout of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has given <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all the companies that take the money from the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) CEO Adrian Coles said it is “irritating” that companies and their members have to pay.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley’s loans are repaid.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid every year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged every year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently... are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that the companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the association of construction companies, told the BBC that he believes it is unfair.
“It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the home-buying market are now called upon to pay part of the account of those institutions that have been much less prudent.”
According to the BSA, no company has failed since documentation began in 1945.
“We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account,” added Mr. Cole.
Interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
The milk rises to 5 pennies per liter
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in the wholesale prices of its milk for an extra five pennies per liter as of Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers need to decide for themselves if they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Banned bail on former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court in Bangladesh has refused a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
His lawyers said the court refused to grant him a bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of the many corruption charges against her.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
The return to Bangladesh by Sheikh Hasina is expected for the next few weeks but his party, Awami League, has demanded that the country’s temporary government backed by the military give it complete freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical care on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of her release, whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court order.
“The High Court rejected the bail request for Sheikh Hasina by adding that she cannot have the bail since she is already abroad on the word for medical care,” says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will file or appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return home from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, a senior Awami League party leader said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-backed government took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical care.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear of the Afghan anti-police campaign
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The UN carried out a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
But it is said that it cannot reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said this despite the Taliban’s promises that they would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission’s decision to force the company to reduce its stake in rival ITV television station.
BSkyB was told by the competition appeals court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the commission had said that BSkyB’s participation hampered the competition and allowed an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's stake in ITV raises doubts about ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's boss, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. Attorney's case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special Public Ministry to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The operation took place when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by the fear that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special Public Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or substantiated," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special public ministry with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for failing performance.
But later it emerged that the dismissed lawyers had not been rated as poorer than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in court action against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud at the expense of democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and bring cases to court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for dismissal, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials were fired.
(The Inspector General’s report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the case, saying that he had a primary responsibility in the layoffs, which he had abdicated to his leadership role and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officials, including Bush’s former senior assistant Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigations.
The epic of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold award at next week’s ceremony in London, said he was “honored” to earn the award.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 album hit.
Coldplay will be leading this year’s awards nominations, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those.”
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was made as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell remained in the charts for nearly nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf – real name Marvin Lee Aday – has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel the concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon on sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossings, some famous, others merely for use.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and long-time residents find it difficult to give the Extra Place position, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and goes north from the First Road – without making the Second Road – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than an active traffic lane.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlante.
The road, however, must have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of luxury buildings recently built on the First Road.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passageway for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were hit by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the mansion district of the past.
But the city’s conservation and development department, which has control of the roads, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Land Use Committee of the City Council, representatives of the city’s agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the city’s hands, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district director of Community Board 3.
“There is very little space left to the ownership of the city, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place,” he said.
“There could be proposals to set it up and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access.”
Avalon Bay many months ago announced that it wants to reopen the small road and install seating, including some to be used for a cafe to which the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
“The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this slump and turn it into a public menace,” he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a Housing Preservation spokesman, said it was in fact the city’s desire to sell the street and pointed out that the agency’s purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that it took its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among its numerous children and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road is perhaps best known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
“The terrain was beautiful,” said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of filth, brandy of clothes and pieces of boots, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write about "gentrification" of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, adding that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a city fragment almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Complaints: A Little Nostalgic Look at the City Going Down"), published part of a City History Speech that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow alley without exit, dark even by day and limited doors of rusted iron warehouses and windows with Saracens, with weeks-old newspapers swirling along the bottoms."
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran swiftly through the back of the road near a door leading into the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls there were graffiti and a bottle of 22-ounce empty beer lying near a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passersby said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggested that it would need to be a bit beautified.
Mr Fields, for his part, said he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “were in black, dirty and disgusting places.”
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in English
In this educational look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior member in California studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose a School.”
Attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that, “African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama’s educational plan specifically supports, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English students.
Yet, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes teaching in a class of languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in filling the learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of the school are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth-graders, a surprising 100 percent of students took the upper-level test in the 2008 math state exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth-graders took the expert level test on English-language art.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient from that preferred by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and exercise, constant assessment of skills, and a “no excuse” attitude.
In addition, and it is here that Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s obstructive approach to English students is “full immersion.”
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “We had a fantastic success with a student who just came from Mexico and if you entered the class 12 months later you wouldn’t have been able to figure out which one it was.”
"It works," he observed, "it works for us."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Spanish-majority schools with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the education policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevent predicting Mr. Obama’s response.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the topic trivial when he said that people should stop worrying about "only-English" legislation.
Instead, he said, “you have to make sure your children are able to speak Spanish.”
If Obama really wants to close these gaps, he should carefully consider the educational models that work rather than despise or banalize them.
Oil is falling sharply and economic fear is renewed
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to lift the economy.
Gross futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel at the New York Stock Exchange in the morning operations.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 a barrel in June, prices had plummeted to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before rising again, amid tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
The anxiety hit investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders said they had reached an agreement over the weekend about the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news has been clouded by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the final episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy Wachovia Corporation’s banking operations, the government said Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts said Friday’s frenetic negotiations had led to a bailout deal “seems to have failed to revive market sentiment.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
“The outlook for global equities, interest rates and foreign exchange markets has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the infection.
From a raw material perspective, our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year as oil consumption at home due to slowing economic growth, reducing forecasts on oil and gas prices by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time with the Jets in the last eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter play on Sunday, when the Jets turned a scoreless game into a comeback.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals matched the grayness of the menacing clouds that outperformed them with a foul play.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon where their growing tune took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
“I didn’t get out of my path,” Favre said of all the steps that came to Coles.
He's a fantastic player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people can think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing catch-up games, the defense hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner heavily.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a rolling launch and relaunched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith planned another move and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forces a fumble from Warner.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals took advantage of that possession of the ball, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had taken the ball back with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely scored a goal from 20 yards, for a gain of 34 to 0.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe his madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, “The second quarter or the third quarter?”
When he was told both – the Jets conceded 21 unanswered points in the third quarter – Mangini said, “I can tell you that I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third.”
There were a lot of points in a little bit of time."
Gebrselassie rested exceeds her world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again why many consider him the best marathon ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2 mile race under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the race favorably flat in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sent his previous score of 2:03:26 in a landslide for 27 seconds last year in Berlin.
At 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record for such an amazing career that he has produced a world championship or world record at any distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing – perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect – that air pollution would worsen her asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees on departure, 55 degrees on arrival - Gebrselassie won on Sunday with a staggering average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half the founders like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went long distances, the marathon record dropped more than two minutes in the past decade, since Ronaldo from Brazil’s Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s win, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had a cramp to his buttocks and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest has left it fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
He has been a little criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for over orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars, counting on aprilist as if it were a mid-bottom race, and putting the world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie’s skills as a marathoner.
With the pace dropped by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, competed in Gebrselassie after the aprilists disappeared.
A little more than three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie made an improvised final to break away from Kwambai, which finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal time of almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi came third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
He lost the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but he recovered to win in Berlin, making his best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon he ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, leaving a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to leave with a big detachment, taking them back after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the theme park on the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles away from the splendor, the noise, the huge, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience come to life.
Eatonville, the first all-black city incorporated in the country and home to Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet in many ways, the city that has described – and that stops tourists from understanding it in the Florida tourist guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project – remains a place apart.
It’s as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who “knowing so little about us, doesn’t know what’s being lost.”
Even now, in a year when a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening speech on the race, many here remain defiant from the outsider’s gaze.
“We’re very careful about how our story is told,” said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black power taking and a community of almost 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of the rural culture of southern blacks - sometimes disgruntled, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's imagination really started with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida’s leadership transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida into a scenario of black history and human drama.
Low as a shell in both life and literature, Hurston brought readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then diverted to more private areas.
“Outside the road to the left,” he wrote, “is the modern public school, brown with its white finishes, with its well-kept and courtyarded gardens, which Howard Miller always knew, thinking he could barely read and write.”
She also mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits the passage rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly, this was not Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
“Now she was saying it the way it was,” said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson’s girls who Hurston immortalized by citing men singing coarse songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who often returned from his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalls that when Hurston was floating in the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a triumphant Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts decent clothing today.
Many residents were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others were drowning.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin said.
But, she added, leaning on her patio chair on the back above Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, and no major conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his abandonment to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a Hurston biography published in 2003.
A change took place in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main road.
The expansion of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 across the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the community’s doorstep.
“During that period, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at the people sitting on one side,” Mr. Franklin says.
“We actually had a girl who was killed by that one once.
They threw a coward out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor for my race".
Residents now say that the disintegration of schools, despite having been positive in some respects, dilute Eatonville’s cohesion and jeopardizes the confidence of its youth.
“The black kids were used to being hugged — I remember this — hugging your teacher in the morning, hugging your teacher in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins’ daughter and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
“You didn’t embrace your white teacher because your white teacher—I mean, there’s a cultural division there,” said Mrs. Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudices, as she did, with happy self-confidence and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just can't figure it out."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway struck the shelves of the bookstores, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as his most famous daughter had once again turned on the lights of the hill.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began designing in 1988 a festival dedicated to Hurston to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state withdrew from its road project.
“The five lanes of the resurfaced highway brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts it more simply: "Now she saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project has helped change the image that the city has of itself.
Those out of town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the public historical record in 1998.
A new one-story library (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a refurbished and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly of Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to look for the story of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permission requested in advance is required for most of the interview, to some things - like the murals on Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man, that show black men in the fields - do not have permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of citizen pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing his entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, not better, not worse and proud, creative, great worker, silly and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s grandson, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, who said he may need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Many people, if they just walked in here, will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’” said Alondra Kenon after the rally on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it’s really a pretty city.”
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan kept away from newspaper stalls and the huge Times Square TV screens, they wouldn’t notice standing in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, nestled above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York live every day the worst “gross day in the office” since the 1929 collapse.
Factories scoot metal trolleys for the through the sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken stretch shirts hanging to a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 of a working day.
It didn’t seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter so that it coincided with the late afternoon break to my JP Morgan Chase subsidiary, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier’s counter, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service counter, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions for the large Macy warehouse and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would then learn from Starr, my “trust banker,” were in line for my own reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken the savings from smaller banks from the places from which commuters make money, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken the money from so-called "thrifts" (a bit like a construction company), credit unions, and types of city savings banks whose subsidiaries operate only within a state, and say they treat customers as family members.
In recent years, 15 of these banks have failed.
In recent days, the Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, has been submitted to the controlled administration, and while the New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend one Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was searching for a purchase.
The employees and the perpetrators who were in front of me, scared of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is asking for more bail on Wall Street.
New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and to its emasculated CEO Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if lying to a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed gatekeeper, almost fifty years of my condo, has changed the subject from our normal topic of conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my spending.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!
I've changed, I'm not taking any risks."
He falls to the Muslim side while Austria turns to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, to the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signs like those street representative mosques with a red line passing in the middle.
Police blamed the right-wing extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties made a lot of money in the national general election.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun Cemetery, near Linz, in a few hours between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The culprits have sprayed Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some graves, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations driven by hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear if the incident is in any way linked to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the profanation, which took place toward the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
In the meantime, Austria embarked on a spiritual research trip following its right turn in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took almost 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have campaigned with a vehemently anti-immigration ticket and some of their slogans have been defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as related to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, adding that they are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses made immediately after the elections, which have established the far-right as the nation’s strongest political bloc, indicating that the change was led predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
A forbidden trip abroad to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of sexual abuse of minors, was banned from traveling to France and Spain by the court.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he had informed the authorities that they were checking him to go to Spain via France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent police last Thursday after it provided judges with evidence of previous Glitter arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at Ashford Pretoria in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, September 25th at Ashford Pretoria, Kent police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's overseas travel to France and Spain until March 25th.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the sex offenders register.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police a seven-day notice of his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they did not want to discuss individual cases or Glitter’s possible moves to the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: "The Kent police will do everything in their power to protect children in this country or abroad.
“From our point of view, it’s easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have adequate comprehensive systems to manage every potential risk more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is Kent police’s primary concern and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of convicted people for sexual offences registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls.
When Glitter came, he flew to Bangkok where he had to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt ill and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have made him transfer to passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge, west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to put him on the sex offender record.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
An interior ministry source said that Jacqui Smith, the interior secretary, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract the character" G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no steering wheel, no clothes from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, at those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser-known side of these masters.
With this goal, the photographer offers an original iconography of the flamenco, taking it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the Flamenco Photography Month program, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day growing,” explains the artist and makes clear that in "Flamenco-People" they may also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists or performers.
These people portrayed "on the road" are "artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the audience.
To capture the personality of these greats it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
Because their personality and character are internal.
What interested me was creating an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco.”
With a passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a photographic plate machine.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and the material, remember classical photography.
The application of various stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects the conception of Bauer's own flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, able to conquer the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are featured in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a kind of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in Flamenco-People the concept is different, the photographer admits "I like to portray people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think portraiture is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or compare yourself with people, characters you sometimes don’t even know or who give you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
The collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the gallery El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata, at the number 20 of Via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he's writing is a "zardo"
It’s set in places he doesn’t yet know about and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is busy with a new project he’s working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived in the Congo for twenty years and crossed the Amazon.
Ever favourite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is working on today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I shouldn't write it."
“If I had a good sense, I wouldn’t write it, but I will do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible,” concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as predicted, the leading figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens’ book “Our mutual friend”, filled the seats of the Juan Bravo theater.
They are presented by Félix Romeo, the writer has found himself in front of an audience to which the time has flown when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, has recalled as born in him the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "to write in
The Spanish-American novelist, however, acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," Vargas Llosa emphasized, arguing that "it has the most antithesis" to the effect that "it has on the contrary, it has the most antithesis."
Time obstructs the Pozoblanco Festival, depriving it of the races
The celebration of the races that should mark the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bulldozers selected for the races had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather conditions have sided with this festival, preventing it from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second tori race from taking place.
The posters featured Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were to face a bull from Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival had a regular event only on Friday.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting three ears and being brought out in triumph, after having toasted with taste and aesthetics.
On the same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two races with greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than for the sake of the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pain.
With the second bull, after a tremendous mule, it gained the whistles of a large part of the public.
A truck with two thousand kilos of hashish crosses the checkpoint in Alava
Five less than ten in the morning.
Agents close the alt to the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping, they flee.
The officers intimated the alt to the two occupants of a van that instead of stopping they gave in to the escape.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The agents, after pursuing them, managed to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years, identified as A.A.J., according to a statement from the Interior Department of the Basque government.
The arrested person is accused of drug trafficking and forgery of public documents.
The accident occurred when some Alava road officials were carrying out a transport control on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armin<0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, in violation of orders, rushed abruptly and overstepped the checkpoint.
The officers pursued until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the edge of the road and its two occupants fled into a wooded area.
The Ertzaintza agents then managed to arrest one of the fugitives and kidnap the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and they took note of once inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish pans, which were located at the back of the vehicle, were later placed under police custody for an in-depth investigation and weight detection.
In addition, since officials found that the license plate had been "duplicated" because it did not match the one in the truck documentation, the arrest was also accused of falsifying public documents.
Ertzaintza is continuing investigations to arrest the second suspect, who has managed to flee as already said, and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A.J., was taken to the police station to carry out appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under the Effect of Drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers as she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the California-based People magazine.
The witness stated that around 4:30 p.m. the Locklear "sniffed the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, and trying to take the car out of the parking lot with sudden maneuvers back and forth. Doing retrograde, she passed several times in front of her sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who at first sight apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that the Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and had left the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was worried about the life of the Locklear."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, partially blocking the road.
“It looked confusing,” and for this reason the agents led her to a specialist center for drug and alcohol use to take her to a test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress proved collaborative and the hypothesis of excess alcohol was discarded from the start, although "according to what the officials initially observed, we believe Locklear was under the effect of some drug."
The Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effect of some unspecified substance and was locked in local prison around 7 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was re-established by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU Federation to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the United Left Party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be for the regional federation of training to make a decision on the case of the former adjunct to the Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said as to the resolution that the party will have to adopt in relation to what has been an aide to date on the Seville council.
However, the IU leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations as to the irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The IU has always wanted this type of investigation to have maximum transparency."
In the same way, he stressed that training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public offices."
"Sangre de Mayo", the epic bet of Garci
Inspired by Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’ Episodios Nacionales, Jose Luis Garci proposes in Sangre de Mayo the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the stream of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a leading a large cast of performers.
Sangre de Mayo, for more than two and a half hours, debuted this Friday in the cinemas, to become a TV miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid in the future.
A great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s literature, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this shot "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before filming a commemorative film for the second centenary of the 2nd anniversary of the Patria.
The 15 million budgets allocated by the Community of Madrid as a whole represented for Garci a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate scenarios and customs to portray a "stupid Spain that misjudged the choice of the leader for which to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people under the rule of Gardiner a huge regita.
However, the director regrets that he did not receive funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than twice as much as Sangre de Mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes predicted by the set design that he himself had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Return to Begin, influenced what is his usual work practice, staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before shooting with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the work of the director resides in what works in going to the theater and doing it."
Many of the performers, some of whom are part of the cast of Sangre de Mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar nominee - winning one - Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy - his Blood de Mayo, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles blindos - would no longer be the most representative of the cinema.
From this film Garci does not expect any awards.
“At first you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you work only for prosperity, and at some point you conform to simply shooting one more film,” explains Garci after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Seville essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Seville dancer pays tribute to another dancer equally from Seville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three moved with her family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in oriental dance.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, the caliber of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of corset which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would love to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offers me this character. I thought it was amazing."
The dancer says: "We do not pretend to tell his whole life, but to collect the spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested me some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangi.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic,” she explains.
The performance includes two outstanding contributions: Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as he does in "The Open Door"; and Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been his pupil.
"Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I am happy because he has agreed to work in my work and this is what I feel very honored about."
The arrangement also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the percussions of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez "who always play the role of eternally art.
In the work is also present in some form the life of this woman that takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then the whole of Europe, since, usually, she resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her, because I think she’s one of the women who has had a huge influence in a given period of history and now no one remembers and much less considers her work as something of value,” Bayon said.
The show will begin today, at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega theatre.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poeta recién casado" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Council of Culture of the Junta dell'Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of the Junta dell'Andalusia" and the "Trium of the Junta of the Junta dell-Ze" (Juan-Ze-Ze-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-Jan-
Thus, the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" concludes with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel museum house and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated in New York last May and was inaugurated in New York last May.
In addition, the Advisory Board for Culture of the Junta dell'Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", curated by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the highest Andalusian poets.
America likes a little less without Paul Newman
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of the whole of America, in the face of the disturbing idea that Newman has left.
It took him a long time to give him an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
He also knew he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what a test goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country have been better because of its existence.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
He died a father of cinema and homeland at a particularly dark time, for fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, desperate for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so virtuous and remain well-mannered, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and won causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the first-born who died of overdose to the creation of the homemade and organic food brand.
All gifts to a country that has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, with no cure for either nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, noticed that a man did not die, an era is over.
Another Englishman, Sam Mendes, an Oscar-winning director, said working with Newman was nothing short of the height of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has ventured to define Paul Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He left a very high level example for all of us," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for rectitude and having a serious private life away from cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
However, some try us and Paul Newman is a good example for these.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful although he certainly did not miss the opportunity to not be.
“Why am I going out to eat hamburgers today if I have a steak at home?”
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that his daughters on earth are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
“Among all the great roles he played, no one was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, solicitous grandfather and passionate philanthropist,” they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my opinion it was by far the worst I have seen.
A lot of nonsense, which if they were later taken into account at the time of the assessment and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense began with the withdrawal of the dorsal, which presupposed that he would leave first.
It didn’t seem like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, it’s to take everything back (including the chip to avoid the codes during the race).
No, I'm not.
You had to go just to take the back (first stupidity, go only for this) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they only had T-shirts of size 'S' (second stupidity, because I need a size XL).
In what world do we live?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small T-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are inescapable compared to the day of the race itself.
In addition to having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that more than 11,000 people are waiting for.
So, as it was predictable, the race started that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once successful in the company, the recovery was even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which attempts of popular rebellion and assault were added to the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, won’t even score in the correct ranking due to the chip that, I guess, didn’t correctly record the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, it will certainly not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search for receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft presented in preview a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service).
Thanks to a camera and a form and face recognition system, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group people in conversation groups.
In the example video, the receptionist detects a third person, but realizes that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
She asks if she’s there to visit someone and tells them she’ll be at her disposal soon.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with essential functions and less loaded with commercial trash, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it would be for “the least.”
A whole discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that it was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for the hardware and software to communicate.
Perform the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It's true.
It will never go away, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You take the computer only to launch Explorer or Firefox – or Chrome – and daily we spend more time browsing the web than in a remote windowed environment.
What is the use of half of the operating system applications?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they are a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need, in fact, and I bring here a small example.
I took the photo posted in this post at one of Microsoft’s employee recreation facilities in Redmond earlier this month.
On the beverage machine a sign urges them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study came to the conclusion that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to do a network search.
Last week, by the way, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be put on the market in early 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the market, is punishing.
La Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso brought her to the Blue Coast, Leonardo of Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as well as Al Pacino and Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the force with the pointed beaks that lift the weights in the walking circus.
It is, in essence, the typical men's t-shirt, with the interior of cotton, embroidered and sleeveless.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, though, the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all.
The "Marcel" excels compared to others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (unrecognizable), which the most emblematic models of the shirt carry as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels compared to others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (unrecognizable), which the most emblematic t-shirt models wear as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company does not concern only the famous "tanks".
It also includes college jackets, retro boxer, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, navy t-shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, the candidate doesn't care"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new business in the field of fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango firm has made of its new headquarters, as well as the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, it conquers you quickly.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let’s say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
What are the elements of your new collection for Mango in this fourth working season for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the cinema of the '50s and '60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love to get lost in the city and watch how women dress, how they combine and mix their clothes.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think yes, although in the end, everything merges and there are many elements in common.
When I was a child, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to fry in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to the dress.
It is known that dancers really like to have their own style to go to class and to the sages, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when they hand you the wardrobe is the moment you actually meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionals.
Not so long ago, you turned 30, you got into a crisis?
No, I'm not.
Never felt better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to taste life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did the things I wanted to do as a child and this gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because my body asks me for it and I also want to be a young mother, I don’t want to lose it.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the movie, you’re waiting for some movies shot last year in different rooms.
That's right, and I'm very much looking forward to it.
Being a woman who comes from the theatre, I am very impatient and anxious, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it can not always be so.
I want you to go "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the Tomb of Christ".
Let's see if you'll like it
A few days ago you debuted on the runway with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like you're on the runway as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, who I’ve known for a long time, called me to invite me to go to London to participate in a charity show for her organization “Women for a Better World” and the clothes we exhibited – I brought two pieces from our collection for Mango – were auctioned off for this raccoon.
People don't know this sweet side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her, that I who have known her for a long time can confirm to you that they are not so true.
Also, I find myself with this good part in which she is involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to do the pine, I would have done the same.
If it’s to help third-world women, you can’t back down.
Relapsed drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive blood alcohol, to install in their car a system that prevents the vehicle from driving in a state of intoxication or if it does not blow in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the Prosecutor General’s Office, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The purpose of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since this will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the General Prosecutor for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Fondazione Istituto Tecnologico para la Sicurezza dell’Automobile (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers reported more than once per drunk driving then drive the car again.
The alcoholock would prevent it, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the expired air and prevents the car from being put into motion if the driver does not breathe, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than allowed.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be in charge of the fine.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles fitted with such devices can reduce up to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to stop these behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since the legal reform can be carried out on an ordinary basis, and, without doubt, the necessary reform for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on a PSOE initiative in which it intends to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., according to the schedule, the Spanish plane in which the princes of the Asturias were traveling landed in the presidential hangar at Mexico City’s Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez Airport.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced to use their hand as a visor to see the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the escalator, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time... you're from here or...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the principles of Asturias are and the importance of travel.
There are many who wait in the hangar of the airport crushed to the red carpet and the military cordon composed of 27 navy soldiers who offer the salute of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, calls to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps have told her that in Mexico City she was threatening bad weather.
They give photographers a smile and a short stop before they pass in the room where the official committee is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel they live in, one of the four largest in the city, a spirited Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The best prize offered by fashion
There is probably no place in the world most appropriate to present a fashion award, which is not Paris and there is probably no more exquisite and bont vivan designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in the Mango showcase at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
Moreover, it is the company’s second largest store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal’s most exquisite canvases, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and needing virtue, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a house dress and some ELAH complements to take his breath away and to the arm of his son Luis - a boy almost two meters tall - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the ce.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, made the honors of home and knight which he finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because they had both surrendered to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the shop in trousers and shirt – hand-drawn – turned to dinner, wearing a long, very sensual black dress and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when she showed us the room for the dance sages, she rang a bell and whistle.
Inés Sastre did not stop for a walk in the premises of the palace, but he had first shown us the photos of his son on his mobile phone.
The next day we were delighted by the presence of Olivier Martinez – another girl who moves by bike – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Hotel Intercontinental in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and had made sure before that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, it's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frenetic everyday life.
And as if that were not enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to the libraries on September 30.
The wake-up call is almost a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m. every morning, but it’s even worse to imagine yourself involved in the frantic pace dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer hurts back.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the effort to get rid of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, a “menu” of tailored options for everyone’s taste and time.
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 Ways to Relax" and its calm will reach the bookstores thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to gain calm in areas such as work or personal relationships, this "manual" refutes that belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline doesn’t already flow into your veins to find your body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn your mind off and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some children talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who talk while they are asleep.
The first time it happens, you take a scare, but it doesn’t really matter much.
This is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquium.
It manifests with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you have been told that you had spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the baby remembers nothing.
There is no single reason that can explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes there are episodes associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, nighttime enuresis (making the pipe in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As already mentioned above it can be associated with very high fever stages, stress or overexertion situations.
In any case, it is a phenomenon yet little studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (cries, screams, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be advisable to look at the child and eventually consult a specialist to check if there are any issues that are generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a result of the situation.
We have said that this is a benign alteration so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if paired with insomnia or a stressful situation).
What you can do, on the other hand, is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to over-excited the child before he goes to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is difficult to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them gain some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more comfortably.
Once the sleepwalkers appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you would interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if it appears very anxious and the episodes have a certain frequency it is better to consult a doctor or check from where such a great anxiety arises in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), don’t fall into the temptation of asking him a question to get information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not see what he is dreaming of saying it, so you need to pay a lot of attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions that these could lead to.
Never tell your child that you could ask him questions during the night to know his or her secrets.
Not even for fun.
Something like that causes a huge amount of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing serious, it's an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern has finally found the way to victory at home after a long fruitless period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-blacks created the most networking opportunities by turning one into the victory of the game.
The pace was not very sustained during this encounter where the attackers expressed themselves to fatigue.
After a first attempt by the captain of the guest team Kauffmann who shot the seven with a shot from afar, the Illhaeusern started to get the best and one after the other caused Dannemarie's defense, Fonderflick from afar, then Hirn high, Romain from the top and Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a block in the center of the field, leaving only the unleashed Riahi at the end of the attack.
The start of the second season was decisive with two initial opportunities signed Riahi and Temporale for the Dannemarie, and immediately after Marais' first net for the well-positioned Illhaeusern, he resumed a rejected ball on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Illhaeusern gunman will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be ejected a dozen minutes later thus leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not cause great trouble to the Eleven of the Illhaeusern, withdrawn just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last minutes of play when, after a rock-climbing action, the ball was swirling across.
Sarkozy meets the fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Brittany.
Prior to the demonstration of fishermen who on Monday brutally prevented access to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided on Tuesday morning to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, to enchant its representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome it "with a constructive spirit" and hope that "they will present themselves with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the steep rise in the price of gasoline, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to Eliseo spokesman David Martinon, the president “will discuss with them about possible solutions to help businesses regain competitiveness and to ensure working conditions and the remuneration of sailors.”
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out "smoke operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le have not been interrupted.
A road block has been implemented on the Quiberon peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors had already proved their determination by burning, starting from dawn, tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, while holding demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as the Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the fishing boats remained at the pier, or in Havre, where twenty boats prevented the movement of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, in the Loire Atlantic, stopped the blockade of the famous Total refinery in Donges in the evening.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting to be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide on any actions.
In Guilvinec, the "Crisis Committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and any possible participation in the planned meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" as "the fishermen will not give up" and "have no intention of moving to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay oil taxes, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but estimate that the yield limit of a vessel is reached only with a gas oil less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
"Butch Cassidy" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his Connecticut home.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and again Sam Mendes welcomed the film legend and engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
The Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
This year, the aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries, despite the threats of recession that are looming on the world economy.
Embraer, the fourth global company in the industry, maintains delivery forecasts for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, especially for aircraft in the range between 30 and 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered in eight years 41 aircraft to Chinese customers.
AIG would give up more than 15% of its business
The insurance company American International Group, which has been remanded by U.S. monetary authorities, would cede more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to consider the sale of much of its business, as well as the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, the newspaper said on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The board of directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to consider possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation has been received from AIG.
The activities that AIG intends to cede include the leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on such transfers, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the loan of 85 billion concessionaires from the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the U.S. authorities seize 80% of its capital.
Paris: Chronostoria Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives voiced against Paulson’s plan to save financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a drop never seen, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) finished at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) higher than that of 17 September 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchanges following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq, the index of major tech stocks, lost 199.61 points closing at 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) closing at 1,106.55, according to final closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the session, Wall Street is plunged after the unexpected rejection of the bank bailout plan, designed to bring stability to markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
“It’s a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This all signals how much the market would count on the project,” he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be “too late” to adopt one.
“If the project was actually dying ... then the witness would quickly be transferred to the Fed – the Federal Reserve – and to other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Globals.
And still highlighting the state of emergency," every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, Piegza stressed.
After the failure of the Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has sharply accelerated, prompting emergency intervention in favor of UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany banks, a sign that markets “are not only facing an American crisis, but a global crisis,” added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.632%, up from 3.827% on Friday night, while the 30-year-old yield fell to 4.161%, up from 4.357% the day before.
Obama in favor of first TV duel
After Friday’s first debate between the two candidates for the White House, I’m giving a second to find out who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign’s headquarters proclaimed the respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of American families.
Political scientist David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, while meritorious, was not brilliant enough to allow him to curb the decline in polls to five weeks from the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, of which a poll published Saturday gives Obama a five-point advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat has had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of undecided voters, found that 39% of them believe Obama to be the winner, while 25% point to McCain.
An excellent performance by his list mate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm on Thursday Obama’s advantage.
“Underestimating it would be a mistake.
It has a good intention,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, stressing the opponent’s “ingenuity” with regard to the issues addressed during the first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that,” he said on multiple occasions.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president,” he said.
This, since yesterday, has been a continuous target for the Republican television campaign.
Obama, for his part, stressed how his election would represent a new future.
Without going too far, it proved to be concise and precise.
He promoted his readiness for the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
“McCain never understood, unlike Obama,” he said, rebutting a Democratic spot this weekend, reprisaling the Republican for not taking the necessary measures to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, in a thunderstorm, for an election meeting.
He did not even pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers". The financial crisis goes in favor of Obama, considered by Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the brink of collapse.
“Next week could be a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s economic intuitiveness to that demonstrated by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse “is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain.”
Reiterating the intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street’s suggestions, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of any energy independence in the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a healthy insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
With caution, the two candidates shoved the 700 billion dollar (470 billion euros) financial bailout-focused questions passed by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, “Did you not notice that there were elections?”
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to contest the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the close of polling stations in central Minsk square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still awaited, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign".
Some admit that they didn’t even vote: “For what? They will do as much as they want, of my vote,” says a boy.
They do not believe that the regime that has made a good impression on foreign observers in the past with the aim of resuming dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
It was not, according to the opposition.
“We have been distanced from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the poll,” said Youri Potemkine, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties.
"It's a change of face," said Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former presidential opposition candidate and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the cards and in this case the executive.
If opposition MPs enter Parliament, it is because they have been nominated, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can involve a television space, regional meetings, and legislative proposals.”
The opposition therefore has a duty to enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters a crisis, and we do not make any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the organisation for security and cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process recognizes the validity of the vote.
It underlines that the participation rates seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has given way to all kinds of manipulation.
“Did you not notice that there were elections?” asks social democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the most convenient to power."
The nightly silence falls on the square in October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission are pleased with their success.
The encounter - The blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, as Héma-Québec became one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it has regained the public’s trust, seriously shaken by the blood scandal infected in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
Faced with such drama and population protests, the Government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public inquiry, led by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to spread recommendations to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was late in drawing up a report, some provinces set up a committee with the aim of designing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) to all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, just 38% of people declared that they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to ongoing efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and field research over the following years, we have regained the public’s trust,” he explains before saying proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec’s population now had confidence in Hema-Quéc.
However, Dr. Décary is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were many cases of the human variant of mad cow in Europe, a new manifestation of the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of its foundation.
“And we didn’t know at all whether that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It was based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when you have doubts and could achieve a serious disease, in this case the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob that manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, are taken measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was refused.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that without any doubt this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has shown us so much that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow to recognize directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
TANs have reduced the window period, i.e. from the moment the person contracted the disease to the one where the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
It was possible to reduce that period to a duration of less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and therefore not being able to identify them has decreased significantly.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone gets infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion is found.
I believe that today one can feel calm in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the management of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
It is never known which pathogen will emerge in the system.
No later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on Réunion Island, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
We must be constantly vigilant", Dr. Décary continues before stressing that in addition to having safe resources, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient resources.
“Needs are increasing as the population ages.
Being the most aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the number of donors, which on average makes up only 3% of Quebec’s residents acceptable as donors.”
However, all healthy people who have reached the age of 18 and meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
“With this 3% we are able to maintain an inventory capable of meeting the needs of hospitals.
Cases of penury are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this group of donors as they age and can no longer make donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today, life is so frantic that it’s hard to find an hour to donate blood,” says desolate Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, ocular globe heart valves and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited at the Héma-Québec which manages the only public blood bank of umbilical cord in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, there is abundant blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our 1,000th cord blood sample and expect to pick up more than 1,000 each year.
You should start proposing them for transplants at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of cord blood removal as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access you", as Héma-Québec does not have the necessary means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - The Impact in the Semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-finals of the A-series qualifiers, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during a second decisive quarter-final match at Stadio Saputo.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro, scored the decisive goal at 90'.
After a goalless first time on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the following networks for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
We remember that on the first game of the return on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semi-finals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thundler filled a first 3-1 in the return game winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semi-finals.
The Impact will have to face the Whitecaps both Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed in the day.
In short - Kovalev's Decisive Network
The Canadiens and their axes are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first meeting, scored a goal, made two passes, and picked up a pass for the victory, in the fourth of the Hab preparatory games.
The only network signed by Kovalev was decisive for the victory.
"I'm not ready yet," he warned the Russian.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
"He tried to cheat in the first period," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a nice ovation.”
Charest to the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
After the General Council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to get elected on the occasion of today's partial elections.
“Expanding the boundaries of our last great northern border”: this is the long-term ambition of Jean Charest, presented yesterday in Levis, by means of tools with a strong visual impact, on the occasion of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "Image mill".
On three maxi screens, they were confused by the spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great means as in the full electoral campaign.
During the press conference, the prime minister declined to rule out the start of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labour, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the most recent speeches of the prime minister, the opening of the northern territory to the 49th parallel had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, has limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but has not spoken about timing or investment quotas, nor has he explained what the precise priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
More than anything, he has merely pointed out what he considers to be a priority: hydropower, forests, but above all the mining sector, which, as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure, has experienced several improvements.
According to Charest's list, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "large territory doubles France" is here, it's Quebec.
Not only is he here, but he is instilled in us,” he insisted, as if to urge a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold fever in Abitibi, the national engineering, the Bay of James.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
"It is a position traditionally maintained by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been in place for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I will reiterate that position in the name of the government," he said.
Moreover, "considering climate change, we must reassess the North," he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will be open all year round due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.”
What about the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very careful in this regard and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the PQ of Hungary), have already given way to the consultation of some thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position, has begun work.
The prime minister does not rule out a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a time when "common visions will be provided."
The development of the North would also follow the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerned, orderly and will respect the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we know how to stand out to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage as leader of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
“From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who nationalized hydropower, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he used another conservative reference, this time, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the project related to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, Charest specified that its commissioning would be scheduled for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel we will do it," he told his militants, raising applause.
In fact, the prime minister, who in April said there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not waste the opportunity to start a poll in the fall, which could happen in accordance with the law.
It underlines that I am certainly very committed, particularly in a federal council mission to China and in the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform for nationalist resolutions, in particular the "constitutional aspirations" that have gone smooth as oil: the PLQ demands above all the recognition of the "Quebec specificity" in the Constitution.
He also hopes that Quebec will have the names of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that the latter will have a veto over the decisions made in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the outline of the North Plan was received skeptically.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, has dusted up Quebec’s Northern Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had done so, "we would have made progress today," Marois said, alongside Jean-Talon's candidate, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ has said it supports the adoption of the Northern Plan by the government.
“What we hope is that this is not simply perceived as a show,” said Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont’s replacement, in a statement.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (Irony of Fate) of Harper's Cabinet, to allow himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the Prime Minister’s entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated a citizen held in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account at all the fact that Omar Khadr was a simple teenager at the time when the facts accused him took place.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets march a child-soldier in in inhumane conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, for information purposes, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, call for the return of Omar Khadraffin to be subject to a regular trial in Canada.
It is precisely the same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not care that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of oppression.
We don’t realize it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and “democracy,” a word Harper continues to ostracize and that sounds so senseless on his lips.
Here we are at a time when there is no morality left: you can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen at the discretion of a head of government until now a minority (see what will be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches the Virtue, the Respect for the Law and the Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
This is where shame lies, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwellian speech of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter states that the world’s largest gold company has played a defamation lawsuit by six million against three authors and a small publishing house quashed with the intention of launching a “transparent public debate”.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a defamation lawsuit, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this substantial difference is completely hidden from Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own.
No matter the outcome of the process, the writers and publisher of the book Canada Black will have to spend a large sum of money in order to organize their own defense and fight, with weapons you will definitely learn, against an army of lawyers funded by the mine company’s practically fund-free pockets.
Moreover, in these arms struggles he learns, the tactic is often to destroy the convenant in order to impose a consensual regulation that impoverishes the opposition as well as scares anyone who dares to speak again on the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is up to the public to present their own view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada debates are usually held with the exchange of views and not with manganese shots.
It would therefore be sufficient for the company to open its books, its documents, and establish a genuine debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have too much confidence in public opinion and mispronounces petitions and letters in support of the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate when his contempt for the same public is well evident?
In the world of the vice president, this word seems to indicate only the perfumed lawyers and not the whole of Canadians; here is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even the denigrates have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Canada Black does so primarily because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in view of what many perceive as a kind of squabbling (researching the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada an ultimatum that is intimate to them)
Beyond Garver’s surreal discourse, Barrack Gold’s squabbling is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in every democratic society.
It denies in block the right to citation of authentic sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss uncomfortable topics at the world’s wealthiest companies, regret multiple lawsuits, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific rules as the authors of Black Canada do.
You have a right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, has been able to manage debates and disagreements and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s excessive measures clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is at the expense of the university world, as is the case with the same public debate in Canada, and it is now time for governments to take measures to limit abusive lawsuits.
Operation - Rescue for Wall Street - Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and the heads of Congress, representatives of the Republican and Democratic divisions, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest bailout plan after the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has been raging on Wall Street for months, is yet to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
It provides in particular: checks on its actual implementation by the elected leaders, new mechanisms guaranteeing the refund of public money, new provisions to contain the number of houses pinned for non-payments, as well as a right of inspection on the salaries paid to your employers.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an effective agreement on markets,” said Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson.
"Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the current crisis on Wall Street," he said.
“It’s the crucial point: if we didn’t act in this way, priceless inconveniences and disturbances would spill over into the daily lives of Americans,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The agreed time limit corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
Joining later in the negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidency have shown themselves quite in favour of the agreement, without, however, avoiding expressing their dissatisfaction before the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama deserves to have added some provisions to the agreement, particularly the one that will allow owners to maintain their home and the one related to the pay for state-backed business executives.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on the American television screen.
Interviewed on another channel to find out if he will vote in favor of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I'd like to analyze the details, but I hope so."
“Being on to what I’ve read, it’s something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward.”
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to reacquire with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky and unsold assets of U.S. financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the outbreak of a real estate bubble that led first to the collapse of mortgages at risk (mutui), then to extend to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and lead to the freezing of liquidity and bankruptcy.
It was a group of Republicans in charge of airing the first draft of an agreement, last week.
It seems to have been pulled out of that blind alley since Democrats accepted that the “toxic” asset of some struggling companies is only protected by the government, rather than bought.
In order to meet everyone in Congress, a provision was added that if the government were to deal with losses over the next five years due to this program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of $250 billion to which another $100 billion can be added if the president refuses to do so.
The payment of $350 billion is expected to be ratified by a further vote of Congress.
In return for his help, Washington will get stakes in the protected companies that will clear his dividends in case of profit and that will be able to resell when the waters calm down.
Under the plan, the federal government will have the option of delaying ping-pong procedures relating to real estate loans and setting limits on the remuneration and severance payments paid to the executives of the companies involved.
As of today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that the free way will be given to their plan.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both at the Republican and Democratic level.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told reporters.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
Not sure how to take advantage of taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed "the caucus of skeptics", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent economics professors, including three Nobel Prizes, have written to us to say, ‘We ask Congress not to draw hastily conclusions and to carefully examine the way forward,’” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, we were once again witnessing the global nature of the crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would give up the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) for the crisis of loan loans to the EU.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is part of the 20 largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It's not the money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, influence and voting rights in banking matters are taken into account.
It’s certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that times are announcing uncertain.”
During this period, at the other end of the Mancha, the British government seems to be nationalizing another bank on the brink of the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all of the loans currently under way at the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will be her to buy the UK bank’s branches and customer accounts.
From the beginning of the economic crisis Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an engaged icon
The beauty from the blue eyes was for a long time its axis in the sleeve, for others its weak spot.
Had he gotten rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor from the ambulatory smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity, and evident talent would have driven him out of that circle of powerful devotees to true sacred monsters.
What a constant!
Paul Newman, who passed away Friday at the age of 83 in his Connecticut ranch following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the 1980s.
Less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled and of which he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious visions of the American dream.
A humble ego, the last mark of quality.
Because he recognized himself as an unguarded country of safe made man, a warrior of the Pacific War, proud of combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, he later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television and early cinema.
The same civil rights activist was also the car driver who qualified for the 24 Hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow zones of a private, discreet, committed, allergic star go with him to the scandals of the show-business, of which you will never be able to fully reveal the mystery.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the term.
This weekend Paul Newman’s disappearance was a heart-wrenching blow to the movie stars, while his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is re-proposed through its interpretations.
The fascinating cowboy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and the boy who is unable to wish for the focused wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Roof, adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that didn’t keep as much promise.
Many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Lass<0xC3><0xB9> someone loves me, by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean and reprised after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar as best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in The Spaccone, Robert Rossen's magnificent film (1961), The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which earned him the only Oscar in 1987 on 9 nominations.
That face through the years, it was his.
He's still here.
The epochs happen through its path.
He is best known for the cult movie Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, the Coen brothers.
The circle had closed with a final role as the godfather of the Irish mafia in my father’s era, in 2003.
Unlike the more glamorous film legends that soon abandoned the craft, Newman will remain in the theaters for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its splendor, parties, and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, called it, with a hint of irony, "a living underplaying challenge", judging exaggerated its performance.
The profession has not always been a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, to which the roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, alcoholics or desperate, of whom he expressed blandness and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, pudic sensibility.
Jennifer's first time in 1968 (based on the Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward as the protagonist, drew a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott for an overdose, dedicated in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tributes rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old fellow gunman Robert Redford (who had played together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite sadness: “His presence has made my life and this country better.”
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a career as a legend, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a challenger of the Hollywood drift, is thus shut down.
We would have missed her face sticking on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her a choice of bad taste, though born as a gag.
The proceeds of those sales were, however, destined for his struggling Children’s Foundation.
Instead of laying on his myth, Newman chose to commit himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that said, "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege.”
And it was equally a privilege for us to follow the path of such a clean and generous American artist.
Citizen model, then, and much more.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & Partners invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and its members will be discussed.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed within the framework of a criminal association that caused considerable damage, and of other crimes, including forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecution the money obtained from tenders, it was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the execution of the activities by means of false invoices.
The state and municipal money, a total of 65 million florins, ended up partly in the boxes of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, made known by the investigating authorities, they have withdrawn the money obtained from tenders on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never fulfilled the obligations assumed.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To do so, the invoice blocks were purchased at the market of J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros, the circular stamps instead were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue the invoices, it was established, among other things, during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag had sent Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados.
According to the confession of the latter, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for consumption, on the model of these, the invoices were prepared to be forwarded to the contestants, among others, those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are work by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, has written mainly the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of the "journey studies" of Lados was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its members in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Association Biztos Pont S<0xC3><0xB6>léet.
So many people, however, according to the restorator, would not all enter the room together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 at the Fondazione Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>rét, later renamed Eg<0xC3><0xBC>tt to Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, a bundle of formal errors and content.
A guest house in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there, however the bill included 130 guests.
But the compilers of the imaginative invoices exaggerated when they reported the Pigal Kft., which also deals with catering, in which accounting - according to the information released to the judicial authorities - did not even appear the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s administrator, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and they showed him the invoices, he immediately realized that they were false documents.
"On the stamp the name and the Iva match of our company were at the wrong point."
He added: in addition to the formal reasons, the fact that according to the invoice were accommodated a hundred people did not return, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
By the way, the bill was for catering and their restaurant is no longer in operation for a long time.
Assiduous invoice compilers did not bother to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, organizes only trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with cash travel in Hungary, which did not agree with the practice of issuing invoices of the company.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, VAT was also included on the invoice, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also wrong on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p Kft. in favor of the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation. In fact, on the services offered by the company you have to apply the VAT to 15% and not to 25% as indicated on the invoices, moreover, the employees of the hotel only issued the invoice.
In addition to this, the "issuers" have damaged other invoices, in the case of a company they indicated as an activity carried out the transport of goods on the road, as is known from the procedure of the Prosecutor's Office, an activity that was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
In addition, due to formal defects - non-compliant invoice format cause, false stamp - it was found that the invoices issued in favor of Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt in the Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, of the XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Cultural Association and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Sports Field of Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3>, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért S<0xC3><0xB6>giet lunched you, which is why the liquidation curator of the company, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They have consciously issued invoices.
Another group of invoice issuers is made up of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny has issued an invoice at the request of Young Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Sozialist<0xC3><0xA1>k in favour of the foundation Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt in Third <0xC3><0x89>vezredért of almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
Together with Zuschlag and its partners, Biogate Kft has also collaborated in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million florins to the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, the Atlasz Association and the V<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>sfeny<0xC5><0x91> Association, as a real economy.
Neither movement of money because the prepared invoices were then cancelled, but the associations forgot to include this in their documents.
In the following group of companies releasing invoices belong those that are connected with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to address the general manager of the Delta Trio Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, who deals with the trade in fuel and automobiles.
The company issued various invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer equipment, for a value of about 18 million florins.
According to the data of the investigation, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since September 14, 2005 has purchased these invoices.
The general manager of this company was a Romanian to which between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would forward the documents concerning the company.
As far as we know Kubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> and Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt to Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny and the counter-value was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian bricklayers founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received a job.
However, the companies were useful to him because at the request of the co-defendant lawyer Zsolt Szente, the editor of the founding documents of the companies, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations related to Zuschlag: the Atlasz and the Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3>n<0xC3><0xB3>.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued to the various entities 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million florins.
The prosecutor believes that Kubatov has collected 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition tender.
Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> e Sz<0xC3><0xB6>vetség for Modern Hungary in January 2006 presented a petition for the public utility agency of the Socialist Party, T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny (TMA).
They also won 500,000 flowers per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the appeal.
In order to prevent this from happening, they presented five fictitious invoices received by Works Team Kft to the TMA.
These invoices were found during the search of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei’s office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants, as they have already done in procura, will probably report on the progress of invoice production.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the defendant number one, J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag, decides to lift his veil over everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed, and although he has promised to talk about everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
It must be seen whether it is in his interest, it may also be that the socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to make the scapegoat.
Zuschlag could now also be offended as his requests for relief from his prison conditions, i.e. the granting of house arrests, have not yet been exhausted.
While the perpetrators of irreparable commercial crimes and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of bidding in excess: why spend more money?
At auctions, buyers are likely to spend more, to overvalue the goods.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, men don’t want to stay behind in a race like the eBay auction, so they’re willing to pay even a higher price.
The research sought to trace the nervous pattern of this "partition" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played at the lot, the other group of players participated in a auction while with the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method they examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could win money, but in the auction game, where the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the body stretched under the cerebral cortex comes into play intensively when you lose the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the “self-gratification” mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise in price is explained by scanning the vehement reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group conducted a financial follow-up investigation.
In this survey, three groups tendered against a partner under different conditions.
The control group reported the actual value of the product in question and they made their bet.
In addition to this, they promised that in the event of a win they would receive another prize of $15.
The third group would instead have received $15 before the auction, but the group members would have lost the money in the event of a loss to the auction.
The difference between the two groups was that for one of them was highlighted the win, while for the other the loss.
By checking the neuroscientists' hypothesis, the members of the group playing "against loss" were willing to make higher bets than the control group or "winning".
“These results are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, these so far explained the phenomena that can be found at the auctions with the joy of winning and with the avoidance of risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image helped resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so we came to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Almost half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, but in Hungary, among the first causes of death, chronic liver disease is mentioned.
In Hungary, the number of patients with hepatitis amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7,000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of infectious liver diseases caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and itterial, but their pathogens and diseases caused differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: Hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected foods), Hepatitis B, C, D and other blood-borne viruses and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal discharge, saliva).
For those who travel it is useful to get vaccinated against the virus A and B, against C there is no vaccine.
Hepatitis A symptoms appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellow spots are formed on the skin and on the white of the eyes, the stool become clear and the dark urine, the healing takes place within two to three weeks.
One million people die every year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receives a pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancers.
Most infected people do not know they have contracted the disease because pathogens subdolely destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and carry out regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, addicts and tattoos.
In the world today, the number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus stands at 200 million.
Because even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease is worth addressing your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, organized for the first time in 2004 worldwide by associations of patients.
The aim is to draw attention to viral chronic hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the results of a recent investigation, the religious faith functions as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the sensation of pain, the British Telegraph reported.
As part of the somewhat bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out on 12 Catholic believers and on as many atheists, while all who observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploratory technique of the human brain it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for controlling pain.
The test is the first in a series of research in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from the University also take part.
The test was carried out exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked the participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci’s ermelino painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would give rise to a sort of religious status among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from each other and considered it to be a calming effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and in this time frame received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
The Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care of them" and "they calmed down and were pervaded by peace".
Looking at the religious-themed image they accounted for 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the test himself, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but you need to find the right image.
“We need to look for an image to which they feed very positive feelings, like a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the results of the search.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality,” Wright added.
After the excellent results remains only the question if the painting of a Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber is presented to the faithful, what effect could it have on pain control?
Would the vision of a quality Virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the day of the tenth birthday, Google can claim to be in people’s pockets as well as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent the holidays, what kind of outpatient they attend and what interests them.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s directors, this is not enough.
As for the skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not see the very substance of the web 2.0.
Recently, Eric Schmidt told the Financial Times that Google’s primary purpose is to collect as much personal data as possible from its users and this is necessary to stick to the original goal of Google’s founders that was: “Let’s put all the information in a system of the world!”
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
Asked what would happen in five years’ time, Schmidt said: “I’d like Google to know how to answer questions like ‘what do I do tomorrow?’ or ‘what would be the right job for me?’ but the software doesn’t know how to answer seemingly simple questions because they don’t know enough about users.”
Not all Internet users are aware that during their internet searches exactly the words searched are recorded, from which IP address are searched and on which page the interested persons stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can store their browsing history, they can relate to what they have searched for and clicked, these then long to go will generate much better tailor-made results; on this same logic it is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services according to our preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I’m dealing with? – concerned users of Google’s data monopoly are asked.
In most cases, the counter-reactions of Internet users are caused by the fear experienced by the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, by the fear of punishment, by the desire for freedom or even by the rebellion to power.
A fact is confirmed, however, and that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of Internet users.
Perhaps the most striking example of this in recent times has been the coordinated action against paedophiles in Brazil, in which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify paedophiles from the page of the Orkut community maintained by Google.
Internet users concerned about personal rights, on the other hand, were sighing of relief in May when the company – in agreement with the EFF’s association of electronic legal protection – successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: even later, you can’t force Google with any information at any cost.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully scrapped nearly 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms obtained in reference to the child protection law confirmation approved years earlier, but still failed to get the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords.)
Google’s judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data are suffocating Google because they believe that this is how their intimate sphere and private life is affected by starting to use their services and rising up with the rebellion watching multinationals stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of fans, activists and computer users appearing in many countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as the conqueror of the world because of Windows, while both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code is always kept up to date and the package of programs is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official software colossus practice.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, the web 2.0.
The web 2.0 speaks only of collaboration, of intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: show ourselves.
A young medium can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can link them to other services such as Twitter or Last.fm that list its musical tastes, all of which can include them in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs about which appear automatically on the most scary photos of its branches.
In the meantime, we read about numerous examples from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common tour of friends, comes to know easily with who spent the night his treacherous boy or a company can fire his employee because he has written a sincere opinion about the truth of the matter:
Those who live an online life make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that lies behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid Google’s monopoly can do it (starting with, for example, Scroogle using Google’s search system but at the same time does not voluntarily leave traces).
Not a few people who don’t purposely sign up for community pages to not be found, Google’s online applications, from text processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions that aren’t linked to huge server parks and that don’t make up our best existing profile yet.
Public opinion doesn’t even wait so long in secret for the moment when Google will pull out its claws.
Currently, the company with its $156 billion worth of value is also worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten Microsoft's revenue from advertising agencies, but software services are only recently introduced.
However, critical observers along with all this find all the alarming points: the corporate summit, for example, has completely rejected the protest of employees after doubling the right of business asylum, has considered the repeated restaurant to be too expensive and the daily pleasure of all employees
A company’s internal rules seem to be not to advertise this new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is certain, that the foreseeable problems of the next months and years will move the world at one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and archiving of books and magazines will take place on the basis of Google
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scrooged account of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached alarmingly.
Two minors helped <0xC3><0x93>zd's double killer to make the tracks disappear
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, who were thoroughly suspected of having helped clear the traces of the crime - said on Tuesday the spokesman of the Police Questura of the Borsod region.
The young people have admitted the crime to their defendant, they are currently accused of favouring.
The two minors, two girls according to the information of the MTI, defend themselves on foot.
The promotion is punishable by up to 5 years of imprisonment.
The suspect in the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was put in pretrial detention on Sunday.
He's suspected of premeditated murder committed for profit.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old had a huge debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off the debt, which is why last Wednesday he lured his creditor into a yard in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI information the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the advanced offer by the Poles despite the Czechs having previously ruled out the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state that intends to sell in a few months more than 60% of its securities.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 says that the offer of Poles represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, they have so far presented an offer to the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all concerned the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, almost 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Banca <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%.
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second September 11".
The global financial disaster came thanks to the American president, who was not able to compact his party behind a law that was quickly scrapped, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire superintendent Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second 9/11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy on the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is growing, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush’s plan was not perfect but as a result of the congressional vote there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to leave the threat - mentions the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a lifesaver to bartering financial institutions and taxpayers’ money can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks fail as in a domino effect then neither the financial means nor new improvised solutions will be sufficient.
In the long run, Member States of the European Union need to overcome their national egoism and concentrate control over dismembered financial markets.
Only on Monday the weakened financial institutions got more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, according to which they seem more and more real the anxieties that European taxpayers, like those in the US, will have to put into their wallet to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not been much concerned about the crisis that has crossed the old continent as a tsunami.
The “salvators” do not have to immediately flood the 100 billion euros, however it would be better if they settled in which case it is appropriate to touch taxpayers’ money to prevent greater damage.
The intelligent machine mimics the flight of the Calabrian
What could be the best way to develop anti-collision technologies if it does not mimic the obstacles sensors that are found in nature?
For example, bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the calibers gave Nissan engineers the initial strategic clue as to how to build the next generation of anti-collision systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic robot, a robotic mini-car with bee properties, with the ultimate goal of creating a system capable of scanning all collisions.
Flying bees form their own oval personal space that is very similar to our protective shield - explained to the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of PR technology and research and development.
Important is the role of the bee’s view, capable of a 300-degree view in each direction.
The engineers came up with the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the bee's view.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels to the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This avoidance maneuver, unlike the current system, takes place in a completely instinctive manner.
“If it weren’t for that, the robot car wouldn’t be able to react quickly to avoid collisions,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaging and more internal layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in a blink of an eye.
But unlike bees, the deviation cannot go upwards or downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steering of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as the possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lithium polymer batteries, lighter and high energy density, which means that their lifespan is higher than that of lithium ions.
According to Andoh, the instantity of the intelligent reaction is important, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store them.
This robot needs to process some inputs in a few seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so use only a few tens of Kb memory.
There is no need for a memory of gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions, which Nissan predicts will be able to be installed on standard vehicles within 10 years.
Additional application possibilities can be represented by unification with the GPS satellite navigation system which by avoiding obstacles on the road leads to destination.
They also found the baby’s name very expensive.
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout law was drafted for the purchase of disproportionate loans, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the sum is spent.
In the new deals protracted until midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders decided on the $700 billion bailout plan after a debate that lasted for days, Reuters reported.
“We have taken serious steps forward,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said it was only a matter of putting the deal on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, speaking of the compromise result, said: the program will work and be effective, but there is still a lot to do. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street but about the reversal of the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets at 8 a.m. Washington time (2 p.m. Central European time Monday night), but did not bring much stock market growth.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the draft economic stabilisation law of 2008 regarding the program, then it will reach the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, then welcomed the White House with joy the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight and we greatly appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
However, the program differs from the original Bush administration proposal, which predicted that the $700 billion would all be spent on buying securities with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now as a first step you can spend at most half of the sum of $700 billion, 250 billion immediately after the vote Monday of Congress, with these the Treasury will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind them, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will decide the president.
A special college will oversee the program to which the President of the Federal Reserve also participates.
Spending the other half of the $700 billion depends on a new congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy credits, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" credits.
The purchase can be made through auctions and in a direct way - the ministry's experts have announced.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the Ministry of Treasury guarantees the means that give concern, for which the companies will pay a price appropriate to the likely damages.
Henrz Paulson said: “The law gives the means necessary for $700 billion to arrive for the urgent needs of the U.S. monetary system, whether it is the purchase of wrong financial means, or their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
“We will take all necessary steps to get us ready to introduce the newly signed law,” he added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think instead that the government will limit their prosperity, defined by the overseas slang simply as gold parachutes.
Payment limitations will only occur in some cases, as well as limitations depend on how the Treasury will offer help.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys within the scope of a auction, it will impose a surcharge on the gold parachute, if they do not send the deceased bank manager into retirement.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate credits, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the directors’ money is not overstated.
In addition, the existing contracts of the gold parachute will not change, the limitation is only valid for new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in the U.S. history of a legal limitation on the remuneration of general administrators - said the measure Democratic Barney Frank chairman of the committee responsible for the financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to own a share of the banks participating in the programme, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also earn us if the economy, and with it the bank saved, will recover.
The bill understands that in the next five years the president must submit to Congress a proposal on how to return to taxpayers the expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their doubts about the project.
“This is not what American citizens have asked us not to defend taxpayer dollars,” California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa said.
Her Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, believes the measures were taken by those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
The prices of the industry continue to rise.
The prices of domestic industrial sales in August 2008 increased by 0.1% compared to the previous month, by 12.9% compared to August 2007 - reports the Hungarian Central Statistical Institute.
Industry export sales prices reported in July 2008 were higher than 1.1%, but decreased by 3.9% compared to the previous year
As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial production costs were 0.7% higher than the previous month and 3.2% higher than a year ago.
Prices of domestic industrial sales related to the previous month increased only by 0.1%.
National sales prices in the processing sector also rose to a minimum of 0.1%, compared to July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 occurred in the leather and footwear processing sector (2.8%), especially bags and belts with 4.6% and the production of shoes with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price level of plastics and chemicals has caused a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the chemicals and products sector.
A decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.9%) and to a minimum extent in the processing of wood (0.1%)
The prices of paper production, publishing and typography have not changed.
In the other sectors of the processing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices rose by 0.3% in August in domestic industrial sales, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of the increase in the price of gas carried out by the authorities since July 1.
Compared to 12 months, taking into account national sales of the processing industry sectors, the biggest increases were in the processing of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacturing sector of products derived from metalworking, the increase in prices was 13.2%, of 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco, representing a decisive weight.
There has been a decrease in prices in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.3%).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, the rate of price increases has ranged from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In total, prices in the manufacturing industry in the past year have risen by 10.2%.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector exceeded last year’s 18.7%.
In national sales among the target groups of the sectors, the biggest increase in monthly prices occurred in August in the sectors producing investment goods (0.7%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices have increased by 0.3%, in the energy and future use sectors, prices have not changed compared to those of the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the increase in higher prices was observed in the energy and future use sector (16.8%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods, the increase was 6.8%, for investment goods a decrease of 1.4% was measured.
Prices of industrial export sales calculated in florins rose by 1.1% in August compared to the previous month, compared to 3.9% in 12 months.
The Hungarian florin in a month has weakened against the euro by 1.7% compared to the dollar by 7.1%, compared to August 2007 it has strengthened by 7.5% compared to the euro and by 15.9% compared to the dollar.
Next year in the U.S. without a visa?
Kinga G<0xC3><0xB6>ncz sees the possibility that by January 12, the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement could come into force - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago with the Hungarian representatives of the place.
In his opinion, "now everything depends on the fact that the sed-out ocean is built in time the electronic system of entry and control."
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be an entry permit, however before departure tourists will have to register.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy will continue negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will award the Cross of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and engage in talks with foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Even Barack Obama and John McCain have stood up in favor of the bank bailout plan
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, on Sunday secured their support for the $700 billion government plan to save banks, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Treasury Secretary.
Representatives of Congress and the administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, on Sunday night announced that they had concluded a principle agreement on the bailout plan of the banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package of the frozen credit market has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to be more suited than their rivals to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys with the focus on economic issues Obama has again recovered a bit of advantage, while McCain’s advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the appointment of Sarah Palin’s vice president, has dispersed.
In a speech in Detroit, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion bill.
He pointed out that the proposal contains those steps of consumer protection that have also been supported by him.
“Now we have to act responsibly ... danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability,” he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not allow himself to escape from defining McCain’s economic ideas out of reach.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained that “everyone we’re going to send down this situation with difficulty ... but doing nothing is not a viable path.”
The Republican Senator reported that the proposal included the creation of a committee to supervise the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outputs of the top managers, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a merit role in the agreements, instead he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole of the right is intact, only inside the pole the voters have become more self-aware - thus Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider’s party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the internet edition of the German magazine on the left, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian-Socialists have re-modernized Bavaria for decades and right now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, so is Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday a process that exactly ten years ago had been feasible ended: the indisputable hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, CSU had fallen to 47.7%, for the first time under the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag election in the period of the aforementioned Stoiber.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization in the region, which devours the parents.
Sociologists have already predicted it 40 years ago, but they have made a lot of mistakes in time. But secularization, the results of education, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the fidelity of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increasing possibilities and the political consequences are obvious.
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more self-conscious, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the CSU has moved away from the classical bourgeois groups: the free professionals, the artisans, the diplomats and the graduates.
Support for the CSU has fallen below 40%.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative newspaper Viennese "Who with whom?" in the article "The presidents of the parties are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confused domestic political situation created as a result of the elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> intends to deal with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the intervention of the SP<0xC3><0x96> in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
Elections have been held, now it revolves around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast by the public TV the leaders of the parties have just made the cards visible.
Werner Faymann, president of SP<0xC3><0x96>, has confirmed that he wants to deal with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists, is possible.
Faymann left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor.
As he stated, the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer has reacted cautiously to all red offers.
As he said, the collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
If his party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still something open in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, leader of BZ<0xC3><0x96>, said he was open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-and-black coalition, we are prepared to assume the responsibility of governing,” Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, organized this year by France with the rotating presidency of the European Union, has begun.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, MEP Fidesz of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenary as the main speaker of the congress, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and thus the most serious obstacle to their assertion.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC5><0xA0>pidla opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were the governments, the European social partners and the representatives of major European civil and rights organisations within the framework of equal opportunities.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, according to the press office of the parliamentary group Fidesz PE, recalled, in addition to discrimination in employment, that Roma are being eroded from the labour market primarily because of their low schooling.
“Most young Roma do not have a middle-level degree and as a result of poor quality elementary education only a ridiculous number of them can achieve a higher degree of study.”
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed the key role of education in upholding human rights as a fundamental human right.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to make these links more widely known between Roma and non-Romani people.
In fact, the sooner a Roma starts school, the more they grow their chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through the taxes paid for income and consumption they contribute to the nation’s budget.
"The European citizenship right of the Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools," L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
According to the honourable Member, the Union's unity of purpose and action is necessary to speed up the process of school desegregation, and that is why it is of fundamental importance that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be properly respected.
“The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be stopped, it is necessary to give Roma children the opportunities afforded by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens of the future of Europe,” J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
In the name of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the purpose of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised each year since last year's meeting in Berlin is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at European level.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the packed Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Despite the bad electoral defeat, the heads have not yet fallen, the discussion of personal issues has been postponed to the summits of the Bavarian CSU.
The party president Erwin Huber and regional governor G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Beckstein are still in their place, the question is as long as the mercy lasts.
The fate of the tandem that has suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes will decide the party’s extraordinary congress in the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have made it known in any case that they are not being attacked with all the strength in the chair.
So they tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that the day after the "Bavarian Tsunami" claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber then at the height of his career, the Christian Social Union got 60.7%, now after the coup against Stoiber they dropped to 43.4%.
For 46 years, the CSU has been an “absolute monarch” in Bavaria, giving 18% of Germany’s GDP.
However, there are always conservatives in the southern region of fundamental importance for the Hungarian economy, in the future they will be forced in any way to coalition.
As the first sign of the reorganization within the party, the vice president and federal minister of agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered to be the possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the narrow exploratory group that will start negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and with the Free Electors exponenting values of right-wing voters to a gove.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of Free Voters, Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity of blows by the Huber-Beckstein couple to then treat the woman with great ambitions without regard.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their strengths to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
Meanwhile, Stoiber will also play an active role, which was so far in the shadows. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU has defined September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber issued some statements to the CSU, saying they would have deserved more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be chancellor after the September 2009 Bundestag elections unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, is reinstated with common forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the CSU’s loss of ground will not have a negative impact on Berlin’s grand coalition.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, but the crisis of the Social-Democrats still lasts.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
Neither a representative of the opposition has entered the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of well-being and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but it is explained by the brogues made in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been unopposed for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition gathered under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) was seriously hoping that Lukashenko, with the presidential term renewed for the fourth time in the following election, would "represent"
The ODS thus gave up a previously assessed boycott.
Behind the opposition’s expectations was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which asked for a loan to reduce the import of Russian natural gas increasingly expensive and agreed to give the Russians the gas pipelines in possession of Beltransgaz that cross the country, could not be considered to improve the political relations with the EU.
It referred to an extension that the OSCE, when assessing the election campaign, placed emphasis on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on running for a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE’s quick report on Monday also criticized the campaign, during which the opposition candidates in practice could not appear on the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this, according to the opposition, there is a noticeable improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to a small confrontation with Moscow continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, even if Russia considers it to be a state with which Bielor
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the presidential candidate of the opposition in the 2006 election, it is desirable that it remains despite the fact that "the power was afraid of even a single opponent entering a weightless Parliament".
The opposition does not foresee actions of protest for the results but rather tries to get voters to hear the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course we have many problems, we have to print opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution local authorities raise difficulties, but also so I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly - Milinkevich said referring to the fact that even the chiefly aided ceto did not consider it to be the main aid, that of
Because of the country’s indebtedness and the rise of the economic deficit, it is only a matter of time that the breakdown of social security “reminds the burial silence” – Milinkevich believes.
Contrary to the opposition politician, Russian observers have judged the elections democratically.
Sergey Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from today this new measure is taken against the furbettes, against those who stamp and then go to drink a coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-fungal news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool for working better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," he said.
“Now a new season of responsibility and transparency is opening up.
This is reformism,” Brunetta said.
With Palazzo Chigi you complete the installation in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
There has been no resistance on the part of the employees, the secretary-general assures: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of everyone".
In other words, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and corner.
Brunette, who suggests, smiling, "a beautiful cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister said: “In three months, the absences for disease of public employees have decreased by 50%, that is, 60,000 more people at work in a year.”
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient
Italy, "whose wage dynamics - explained the minister - in the last 8-10 years have been twice as much as the private sector and well above inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have joined forces to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by joining the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Function today will spread numbers about the least absenteeism at work for causes of illness - writes the Consumers Association - the people of the 'Operating Fans' are constantly growing.
In fact, there are thousands of correct and productive public administration employees in Italy who have come together to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.”
In particular, the Tar will be subject to the exclusion of additional economic treatments for diseases dependent on service; the extension of the hours of availability of the sick worker, within which control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data confirm that the white deaths were around 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the leading causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw attention to institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday in October.
"The worrying data released by Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said President Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the president of Anmil, the National Association for the Disabled and the Disabled at Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "living appreciation for the constant associative commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
“Of course, an outraged ‘enough’ has arisen, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion, but the daily reality presents dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives promoted in the field of education are of particular significance for a more direct awareness by young people who are facing the world of work.
It is necessary to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to be on the alert about its social gravity, to apply and improve legislative rules.
For his part, the Speaker of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes a decisive commitment on all institutions to urgently end it".
“The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but that doesn’t take away from the fact that the number of white deaths is still impressive,” said Anmil Pietro Mercandelli, president of the company.
In fact, we would not want this "downtrend" to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when the attention is relaxed that the tragedy explodes.
“We believe that at the general level too little is still being done to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our view, more checks and inspections are needed, but also stronger intervention on the training of workers, starting from the school world.”
"There is a further effort - he added - in terms of communication and raising public awareness.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration in the levels of indemnity protection provided for the victims of work" and the "advantages of assistance to which the system has been pushing in recent years".
“The goal, then, is to give back to the worker the insurance guarantee because the fate of those who are injured should not depend on spontaneity or enlargement from time to time laid down by the legislator.”
Mp3 readers under indictment, put at risk the hearing
Listening to high volume music for an extended period of time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission reports, which cites the opinion of the EU Scientific Committee on Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risks (Csrseri) published today in a statement in Brussels.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day holding the high volume device risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and high-acoustic cell phones can unconsciously damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“From scientific findings,” the EU official continued, “a clear risk emerges and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is that we need to raise awareness among consumers and make this information public.
We must also re-examine existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology.”
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise from them.
"Scientists - concludes the EU's executive - confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now, together with the Member States and interested parties, examine what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from musical instruments and devices."
At present, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical equipment to 100 dB, but concerns are growing as to the hearing damage that may result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damages by using solutions such as reducing levels and the duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable music equipment if they listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for just 5 hours per week exceed the currently in force limits on maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods of time are at risk of permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
This would concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno gives way to the Commission for the future of capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the sums will be withdrawn.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the future of Rome Capitale", which this morning settled in its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once the batters are closed in March, the Junta and the Municipal Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present the Strategic Plan for Rome in June with the "official bubble" of the Campidoglio and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - it has to underline Alemanno - It will have to provide proposals for an idea for the development of Rome which the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the Municipal Council, will then be able to take advantage of.
There is no overlap of roles but only the desire to have a place where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March he will finish his work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise timeline.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital.
To those who accuse the Commission of uselessness, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If there is quality, as well as in France with the Attalus Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is crushed on the management of the newspaper and on the emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, from a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.”
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wishes to point out that “this Commission is neither a useless body nor a carriage: it is absolutely free, will not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences expressed by the Capital”.
For Alemanno, in fact, “it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immobile, in order to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, which it absolutely needs, thinking with a united spirit about its future.”
A future that, the mayor of Rome says, "will not be limited to the current municipal borders only but will look far beyond" not only in view of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but also in view of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who keeps us going independently: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
She wrote a Miami lady on a web site: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big toast face: he believes he will win the highest office in a nation that has had two governors and five black senators in all!”
In reality, there are attacks that don’t say much; they are clearly racial attacks and don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president? Then there are the polls; they all say Obama will win and with a good detachment.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the southern suburbs of the United States, wrote an editorial: once in the booth to vote we know well who will vote for the American patriot.
It comes out one side of the American mentality kept covered up to the last.
“Say what you want, then we’ll think about where to put the crucifix, whether it’s Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before, which almost certainly appears to be the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasoning, the winning weapon for Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
It changes America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to football in the saddle.
In Iraq, there are 4,500 soldiers who lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush’s weak point.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to perform.
Usa, the economic trail is also felt on journalists: in the newspapers it is time to cut. And many blame the internet, "murderer" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen did not openly state that they felt less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like they once did.
The problem for U.S. journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you don’t want traditional journalism as the general public thinks it is, to shrink substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that national journalism is going the wrong way.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The major publishing houses open a gap to the internet, for many views such as the "murderer" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that they “do something good” for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism today is between who runs the newsrooms – that is, the directors – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national executives are sure that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “work safety.”
Executives who think they lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% nationally.
For staff reporters it goes to 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of “take it or leave it”, take it or leave it.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can also earn $10,000 a month, in addition to pensions and insurance payments.
For the holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: all days after the first year, all after the third to arrive at 15 total days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, often “mistake” themselves during the year.
It is all about climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROMA, DANILO COPPOLA REST IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a dwelling in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the counterpatch investigation related to the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
During the course of the process at his expense, last week, he obtained the discharge from the housewives transformed into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent could travel from the provincial town to a dwelling in the capital.
According to the court, however, these moves (to which the PM gave his opinion against) would allow him to influence his company and access the evidence that accuse him.
The Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already emerged a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were, and are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by the New York Times yesterday informing us that the ongoing crisis is breaking the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old soul East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the other hand, conservative, hostile to “those of Washington” and to the financial center.
The soul, by the way, that has become too powerful alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
This just mentioned, however, is just an example of the changes, of the great changes, which the ongoing economic earthquake may pre-announce or already let you see: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not here alone.
Both in the US and Europe, the crisis seems to act as an accelerator of incubation phenomena for a long time, and in the new climate they solidify and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-upgradation, the extraordinary re-launch, of the dual category of State-sovereignty in relation to a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions, which, yes, have strong ties with abroad, but which, above all, see the balance sheets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of the question or not to have much to say: the flashy evidence is given by the European Union which divides as usual between the different interests and between the different state strategies fails to decide any common policy line.
And so it is from the government of every single state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all the provision of funds: since when it comes to the straits it is only the states that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in order.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incommensurable value, in certain circumstances, which probably no market and no international organisation will ever have in common.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the national-statutory element is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the growing importance that the latest developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of network, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized from a stretch that our future will have to do little to grow.
All things that, look a little, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are nevertheless absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So that those who find themselves to be sovereign, certainly possess many more cards than those who are not, those who have the misfortune of living in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novel that predicts a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective needs authoritative leadership, the request of someone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, especially economic ones, turns out to be so inadequate and full of shadow zones.
And together, something even deeper and in a certain way disturbing: a discredit, an intolerance, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of Western countries.
That is, it seems to be becoming more and more popular, in large areas of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far in the limelight, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall acceptance of the term, to have made their own time and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majors.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneanly feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in the sudden electoral "revolts" or in the sudden movements of the collective moods of these last and last times, from the British to the Croats, from the British to the Austro-Bertians, from the Croatsians to the Croats.
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it more and more difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not now taking shape in the deep layers of the economy of Western societies.
In the face of all this, talking about a “mass rebellion” on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes open is definitely not for nothing.
The super glue to walk on walls
Defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has gone very close to us.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers managed to keep a 100-kilogram body glued to a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scientists is an evolution of those existing that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the geese, covered by microscopic hairs that manage to ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
Tests carried out on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time “it easily disengages from the wall,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton’s Faculty of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use like the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
For now, I won't be a superhero.
THE OTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists presented an adhesive made of microfibers such as hair that self-cleans itself from dust while moving on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juices
Pay attention to grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in the summer because they are desiccant and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time to certain life-saving drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing depending on the case the effectiveness with consequences also serious for health.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with the intake of some medicines, David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in progress in Philadelphia launches a new alarm: it is enough to make a glass of apple juice.
The grapefruit juice had already ended under indictment because it was considered responsible for increasing to levels considered toxic the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological drugs.
RISKS - The same Italian Medicines Agency reported in an information bulletin two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mix and to pay attention to what you drink in case you take drugs such as Diazepam or Mezepad.
Not only grapefruit - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: "These findings are usually immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the leaflets of the medicines you are taking and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not make us impress but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification,” the expert told Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies of business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron failed, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked not a few controversies and that for years was re-enacted to the economist, but that now turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and also a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from public attention,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank’s executive committee, Krugman is a “high-value economist,” but also a publicist with a “very aggressive style, particularly critical of the Bush administration’s excesses of liberalism.”
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the personal productivity open source suite that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the best-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year’s work by volunteer developers, behind which SUN Microsystem monitors, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with several new features: to the welcome screen and to the revised interface and rendered less spartan, add other more substantial ISOs such as the standard ISO and the native compatibility for the new Apple OS version.
Also pay attention to interoperability with the 2007 Office suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx,.xlsx,.pptx).
Interesting some features specific to some forms such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by email, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphics processing form, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "Hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical Adobe format graphics with the elements of a spreadsheet or text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene with multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts over changes, in the word processor, each employee is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks should release the final result.
The English version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
Upon request, the installation CD can also be sent home or at work.
And if the theme of free time can be a drag for home diffusion, it is precisely in business that Open Office the suite tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects realized in public administration and in schools.
And there are not even the realities that offer an ideal training, consulting and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for Word's peer-to-peer video writing; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint emulo presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally graphing the module
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are almost 3 million and 600,000, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is also positive is the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the Gerolsteiner team, third ranked and winner of the best climber shirt.
To report the news is the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive runner at the Cera, the third generation Ep, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also he of the Gerolsteiner.
Analysis of blood samples from Kohl are among those carried out in the last weeks by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity in Cera, the Austrian will lose third place in the Tour and will meet the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positivity at the Third Generation Ep is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also earning himself the best climber pois shirt.
IMPORTANT: NEW YORK TIMES IS CHIED, ITALY IS RAZZISTA?
Italy "from a country of emigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
This is turning the Belpaese into a nation of racists? That’s what the New York Times asks in a long article that dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of biscuits.
This case highlights what the Nyt calls the "Northern Paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those that record "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
Confirming the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
The new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegals is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic stressed the trend: “Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism.”
Students victims of expensive-rents up to 900 euros for one room
The rental market for university students is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the union of tenants, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on very serious characters to the point that it excludes entire bands of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should support - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities also the strong demand from the students for re-education has been greatly increased.
In most cases, the rental offers then contain a number of violations: free, unregistered, no-canon contracts, sub-rents connected.
For the Sunia, extraordinary measures are needed that, through the revision of the tax, can calm prices.
Looking at the details of the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Black Bande area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in the Vittoria area).
In Florence a bed space costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 for a single one.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) are asked about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double room.
Values only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
You save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples it takes 300/450 euros for a bed, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas Polyclinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for one bed it takes 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the city economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of rents to non-EU students is most frequent, as in Perugia, there is finally another anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon demanded by foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradise, the cities cancel the historic rooms
Historical cinemas close in favor of the Multiplex.
“A city without movie theaters is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the big Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of large multi-seaters and the consequent death by consumptive mono-seaters in the central areas of cities, is one of those events that we find inevitable and incontrovertible but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and loaded with memory,"it is as if there were less a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of street and many emotions", observes the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, for a film that won the Oscar and the Grand Prize of the jury.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of performers, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed the beatings of 316 traditional cinemas, and to pay the most are the rooms in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally" observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures are being built but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all of its visitors are willing to move into the multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund in favour of the operators: the state's previous debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, they would need between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about the closures, decided to run to the stands with the signing of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote mono-sala cinemas both in the historical center and on the outskirts.
Among the rules provided are tax relief measures in favour of the operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for the stop and in some parking lots.
“It is an initiative that I like,” observes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by setting other measures.
It is certain, however, that in order to counteract the rapport of multiplexing, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Paradise Cinema", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the Rialto or the Quirinale National road now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so as not to see the signs torn by dust I turn the other way.”
Links between politics and 'drangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the Municipality's choices to the interests of the Piromalli shell".
The charges are heavy that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria address the mayor and vice-president of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in mafia association.
In addition, Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his nephew, the boss’s name, already condemned for association for crimes of mafia mold, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
“In the wake of any legal and moral norm, as well as common sense,” the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay advice to lawyer Piromalli.
“It would thus have been allowed to go into the municipalities officially, facilitating the already huge possibilities of control and address of the public administration,” the judges write.
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local bodies and organized malavita are many" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the ‘drangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean.’
Today’s arrests follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalli shell.
Since the end of April last year, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved but already in 1991, and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been elevated by the task of administering the Municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been elected head of a centre-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called in question the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having architected everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest warrant signed today, explain that the Piromalli shell had even come to ask for the change of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PMs write, it emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group famously close to the Piromalls, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the shell".
When energy is born from the waves now descend into the field the big
It is an extinct field, which occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have put their eyes, and now they are trying to put their hands, colossal like the Chevron.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmentalist instances and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by offshore wind turbines.
This amount would be twice as much as that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be currents and tides.
Colossus at the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy, there are more and more of these companies that have always been committed to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies - said the spokesman of a company associated with the U.S. oil giant in the Wall Street Journal - and is considering the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is needed to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It’s a signal not long ago, especially if you consider that just in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, there are New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power to follow the path of energy coming from the sea and the amounts invested so far, as far as is not known in detail, indicate an increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology still at dawn, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese or some in Scotland are small in size and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
In order to produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure rotates a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now, there are four such installations under design, pending only federal approval and part of the energy could serve for a military installation.
The Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The movement of water when there are tides causes the turbine blades to rotate, creating a rotational movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to take advantage of the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electricity, is now worth the potential of the tides.
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun or the waves and therefore more reliable as an energy source.
It is precisely on the energy of the tides that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others overlooking the coasts, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and predicted investments up to 35 million for 2009.
