Novak helped Trabzonspor to second place, <0xC5><0xA0>koda also hit
Defendant Filip Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k helped a goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor to the title of vice-champion.
His team won 2–1 on the field of Kayserispor and kept the third Besiktas behind.
Milan <0xC5><0xA0>koda scored the tenth goal for Rizespor after the January transfer from Slavia, who saved himself, even though he scored 1:3 on Fenerbahce.
Novak confirmed the excellent productivity of the defender with the seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63rd minute, goalkeeper Kayserispor only fired a sharp shot and Czech footballer from an angle fired the ball into the net.
The domestics managed to settle five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor, in the sixth minute of the setup, threw the win on his side when he successfully finished the four-on-one break.
The damage in the start of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce equalled the lead to 1:1.
Rizespor did not hold the indecisive position for a long time, but it did not have to hate him, because thanks to the results of the rivals, he remained three points above the descending belt.
The competition ends Sunday's match of the champion Basaksehir on the Kasimpasy pitch.
Well-hidden Cave near the deserter in the woods near Nové Bor was actually not habitable
In the north of Bohemia in the foothills of the Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ické Mountains, near Nové Bor in Czechoslovakia, in the forests that led the Tomb Road, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Both natural and artificially created.
And we're going after that human hand made.
The place is called Cave by the deserter.
In fact, no deserter ever lived there and the cave served as a hideout, more precisely, a hidden chamber apparently on the grain.
The cave is carved from the side to the rock guard and accessible from the stairs above.
But until the last moment, it is practically invisible.
It will reveal it to a narrow staircase leading to a rock gallery, from where it is just entering the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is far from human habitation, at the time of its formation it could be on the upper plateau, where today there is forest, field.
“The fact that the building has no window and is not even in a traditional place of heating, clearly shows that no deserter could ever survive the winter here,” explains historian Kamil Podrouzzek of the Faculty of Philosophy Jan Evangelista Purkyn<0xC4><0x9B> in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem.
A single-space object has only a stone bench in the back, apparently used to store containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podrouzzek.
On the walls of the cave are visible traces of the tools.
Cracking the sandbox with a tip was quite simple and quick for the devotee.
It was enough to properly use the frying pan and gradually deglaze the sandbox.
Depending on the length of the trail after the peak and the way of cutting at all, the period of the formation of the cave can be determined in a frame.
According to historians, this is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the disorder that appears in it, there is sometimes someone oversleeping there in the present day.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and you will be caught under the cave’s flowing path and near the county road, then you will surely find the path down as well.
And along the way from the forest you may still be caught near Havran<0xC3><0xAD> rocks.
<0xC5><0xBD>okay Mina<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k is in artificial sleep after a severe fall in Germany
"Philip is now in the best hands.
The Institute is equipped for similar cases, and fortunately we have a part of the family in Hannover.
This greatly facilitates the situation and also the care of Finja's daughter," the server Jezdci.cz quoted Mina<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k's wife Katji as saying.
“Everyone is doing their best, Philip now needs time to recover.
It makes no sense to make any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the problem of trauma to the head and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said the wife of a 45-year-old jockey.
In a tweet, Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot on Saturday, also called for the financial support of the injured Mina<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, equalising the legend of Lester Piggott.
To date, almost 70,000 euros have been spent on Gofundme.
The target is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000 (Crown 2.6 million).
Video referee took the footballers Sassuola four goals, lost 0:2
Sassuola's players, in Saturday's match in Naples, got four balls into the opponent's goal, but in the end they had to face off with a 0:2 defeat.
None of their referees conceded any of their goals after consulting with the video due to the offside.
According to the Italian media, this is a record disservice of the technology, so many interventions VAR has never done to one team.
"VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than road radar and punished him like no other team.
New technology is breaking records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a comment.
"Festival of unknown goals of Sassuola.
He’s never been so tough on one team before,” added Corriere dello Sport.
On Saturday, Napoli took the lead in the 8th minute, but after half an hour of playing, Sassuolo seemed to have settled.
However, Filip Djuri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>'s goal was not recognized after the intervention of the video referee due to the offside.
For the same reason, Djuricicic’s further intervention and the hits of Francesca Caputa and Domenica Berardi were not paid.
On the contrary, the home team added another goal.
The electric car has a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they have won the most in history.
"The growth has attracted both a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and a trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as an accelerated development of registration of new e-cars," said Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Chmel<0xC3><0xAD>k, head of clean technology department of the Czech Republic.
Other major players such as PRE and E.ON, Tesla’s electric car maker, as well as the Bill and Lidl supermarkets, are also reported to have their share on the market.
The operator of the classic pumping stations is again represented by the company MOL.
But he doesn't have the numbers yet.
“Our electromobility network has only just begun to build a wave,” said Jan Juskov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the company.
However, the editor of the Journal exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by the company <0xC4><0x8C>EZ.
It turns out that the drivers from the stations took an average of 13.5 kWh.
This corresponds to the passage of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If we miss a small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charge takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of the tanking then took place in a free tariff.
If the motorists were already paying for the pick-up, their typical expense was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility is especially prevalent in the capital.
On the territory of Prague, there are all five of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ’s most-charged receivers, which, with their popularity, also shade the entire regional city.
There is a little bit of Olomouc between the regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is for a remote station in the border, for example in Bohum<0xC3><0xAD>n or Prachatice, which often remain throughout the day without use.
More than 4,000 electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars arrived.
In an extensive survey of Czechs on the Move, 8 percent of readers said they are considering buying an electric car into the family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not only for better water retention.
Environmental activists protesting in Prague
According to the organizers, the government’s steps so far in protecting and healing the Czech landscape and solving the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called for a more robust approach.
The events called The Last Drop were attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Spirit Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local communities.
"We have here, for example, people who oppose long-term expansion at the bottom of the Tur<0xC3><0xB3>w, there are people who oppose the mining of screed near the island of Uhersk<0xC3><0xBD> Ostroh, there are people who oppose the construction of senseless dams," said the organisers Marika Wolfov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She said the main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan to conserve water in the countryside, a sweeping change in agricultural policy and a system of subsidies to support sustainable agriculture and the fastest transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not reckless and devastating business," she said.
On Malostranské Square, a stand with a petition calling on the representatives of the Czech state to bet on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of Czech soil and landscape was placed.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans like "The end of the sledgehammer" or "The mine of coal, more boats".
Jan <0xC5><0xA0>koda came to Prague from the association Za Vodka for the People, which is protesting against the plan for the extraction of scissors in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nsk.
"It's threatening a source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the gardens are the fifth most useful source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned excavation is only about 500 meters from the gardens and it is believed that the quality of the water will be threatened.
He came from the village of Vale<0xC4><0x8D> in Karlovarsk Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> for so-called agroecological farmers.
He pointed out the stakes of small farms, which do not marry for income and profit and supply the inhabitants directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population completely normally, on top of that they do not do such damage to the shape of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people were killed when a plane crashed into a house in Germany.
Three people were killed and two others injured in the crash of an ultra-light aircraft into an apartment building in western Germany today.
They reported on the local rescuers, according to which there are probably two crew members and one resident of the house between the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The ground floor apartment, which was one of the five apartment units in the house, subsequently ignited the fire.
Firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
A spokesman for the local fire chief, Robert Meyboom, said both members of the aircraft's crew had died.
The third victim, according to police, is a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) newspaper, referring to Mayor Wesel, wrote that she was the mother of a self-employed woman whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with light injuries.
In the vicinity of the accident, an emergency parachute was found, which apparently served as a landing brake.
Police say he's from a plane crash.
There was room for two people on the plane.
The machine started from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post newspaper, referring to the obvious witness, said that before the crash, the plane collided with a hot-air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, with reference to other witnesses, wrote that the plane had crashed into the air before it hit the ground.
On Saturday, the Czech Savings Bank mistakenly charged some payments with a card twice.
The error has already been removed
On Saturday afternoon, the <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna mistakenly charged some payments with a card twice.
According to bank spokesman Lukas Krop<0xC3><0xAD>k, the problem could have been related to thousands of transactions.
The error has already been carefully removed and the money returned to the clients.
The problem with the doubling of card payments was noted by the savings bank on Saturday afternoon.
"Yesterday (Saturday) night, we made an update of the system and immediately returned all these duplicate payments to our customers.
At this point everything is working smoothly," Krop<0xC3><0xAD>k said Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients that the bank has read out money from card payments twice, the bank’s spokesman does not know, according to his estimate, was less than a thousand transactions.
The causes of the problems are carefully identified.
"It could be a combination of several factors," said Krop<0xC3><0xAD>k.
<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
By the end of March, there were 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.

We are working on this together with epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," said Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch in <0xC4><0x8C>T.
It will be called semafor, individual regions will be marked green, orange or red depending on the risk of coronavirus.
The Minister added that the inclusion of individual regions will be further discussed with epidemiology.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian region would have the orange color at the moment and Prague would be close to it.
The map will also show individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to address this at the regional level, because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.

Bridge autodrome launches new e-shop
Customers of the bridge motorway can use a new e-shop on its website.
It will also buy coupons for free and test rides by car or motorcycle on a large racing circuit, which was previously only possible in person at the highway worker in the starting tower.
“We’ve come to improve the e-shop so that it’s user-friendly, and at the same time we’ve expanded the portfolio of products and services that can be acquired through it.
At the same time, on this occasion, we have prepared a bonus for our customers in the form of a discount of 1 000 kroner for all safe driving courses from our offer.
Discount coupons can be found at www.autodrom-most.cz," explained the business and marketing director of AUTODROM MOST Jan Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>.

The course of most diseases is mild, only three percent of infected people have to go to the hospital
Either the milder form of coronavirus is spreading in the Czech Republic, or the summer sun has significantly improved our immunity.
The infectious wards of hospitals are semi-empty, although the numbers of infected grow.
"This situation today and in April is quite different and it is given mainly by the number of hospitalized," says Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch.
It is worth recalling that on 11 April, when the first wave of epidemics erupted in our country, all the clothes were worn, the army was picked up, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfection for a year in advance.
Ten people died every day.
Today, daily increases in the number of infected people are higher, but every day with COVID-19 a maximum of two people die.
The highest number of infected per capita still has Karvinsko, similar numbers already have Jihlava due to a fire in the local Alzheimer's Center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for seniors closed the hygiene in <0xC4><0x8C>erno<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87>i on Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovéhradeck.
The disease has been confirmed by tests in one of the nurses.
"We're tracking, we're restricting movement, we have all the hygiene measures," says Martin Sch<0xC3><0xA1>niel, director of the retirement home.
According to him, none of the clients at home have symptoms of the disease yet.
Flat-screen testing will start on hygiene tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
An increase in the number of infected patients is also reported in hospitals.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will know if people are wearing a suit at the entrance.
The record is reported by South Korean hygienists, who have recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them made up of foreign employees of a pragmatist company.
In total, 131 infected people arrived on Saturday – half of the Friday number – but less tested on the weekend.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh wrote a short story, Anderson threw
The big surprise of the tournament named after Dimitri van den Bergh showed excellent performance even in the battle with the player who won the second most prestigious company within the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was bilaterally balanced, the break came at a level of 8:7 for the Belgian batsman.
Van den Bergh took the breech with a 13-barrel leg and has been on top ever since.
He literally shook his opponent’s game and the much more experienced “Flying Scotsman” was barely getting to the doubles.
The way in which he had the "Creator of Dreams" in his chest also testifies to the fact that the tried-and-tested Anderson played his first maximum until the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian managed a great high checkout.
The last time he lost in the eleventh leg, in an unfavourable condition, he "catched a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the match, Anderson was shown a huge frustration.
Rather, he was just throwing the arrows, and his triumphant rival was doing himself perfectly sovereign.
Van den Bergh immediately changed the first of three dart matches and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
The profit of the trophy named after Phil Taylor is more valuable to the Belgian batsman because it is his first major to win.
The last player to defeat Van den Bergh is Karel Sedl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
In Nantes, charges were dropped over the cathedral fire, which the man confessed to.
The Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original stained glass windows of the 16th century and destroyed the Varhans.
Suspects of arson were being investigated because the fire occurred in a temple from three different locations.
At the same time, the police at the entrances did not find any evidence that anyone was getting into the cathedral by force.
The accused is a volunteer at the local diocese, a ninety-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without initiating a criminal prosecution.
Now, the prosecutor’s office has reported that, based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces charges of arson.
In case he is found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a high fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regretted the crime and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch: On Monday we will present "semafor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is to fulfill the role of the pandemic plan, due to which the government and the Ministry of Health are facing criticism.
"The steps will be according to the strength of community dissemination," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian region or Prague would reach a medium, orange degree.
The system is designed as a regional system, as the situation in each region varies significantly, he added.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiology and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (<0xC3><0x9A>ZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be imposed at individual levels, whether it is the obligation to wear uniforms or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
To create an epidemiological plan in the Prime Party television series, Interior Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) called for clear information on what measures can be expected if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch commented on this by saying that there is nothing significant happening in the place of the declaration of an emergency or the resumption of the crisis staff.
The government, given the growing number of infected people since Saturday across the Czech Republic, has again introduced the obligation to wear clothes at internal events over 100 people.
As of Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1,000 people.
The procedure of the government, where it was not clear until the last moment what measures were to be taken and when they would start to pay even when they would be announced, was met with criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main factors should create a sense of security on the contrary, and the confusion on the contrary should be leveled," Senator Marek Hil<0xC5><0xA1>er said in Questions.
The measures may now vary by region, for example in Prague from Sunday the obligation to wear clothes also applies in non-resident medical facilities, i.e. in pharmacies or waiting rooms at a doctor.
The obligation to wear underwear when visiting medical and social facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced since Friday in Liberec and <0xC3><0x9A>stek region.
In the Highlands of Jihlava, it is necessary to wear underwear in internal public spaces, in the MHD and in medical facilities from July 14.
On the contrary, in the Moravian-Silesian region, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed, as in the Central Bohemian region of Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called "semafor" for Europe, which distinguishes the degree of risk of infection in individual European countries and thus regulates the rules valid for entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
In low- and middle-risk countries, since June 15, the authorities do not require a negative coronavirus test for Czech citizens or instead they do not order quarantine.
These are mandatory when the Czechs return from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU Member States are now in the low-risk category of infections.
Technoparty in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovska continues.
Plays at a third capacity, should finish at noon
Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota (Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsko) Technoparty at Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovska continues on Sunday evening.
He still plays a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to evening police estimates, there are about 500 people left after 20:00, the original rough estimates talked about three hundred, they were 900 in the morning, police spokesman Lucie Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Originally, the technoparty was supposed to end on Sunday at noon, at that time part of the music systems was really quiet.
"Some have already left and others are going to leave.
Music production is in part ongoing.
We expect that there will be a gradual disconnection and decommissioning of music systems," Novakov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
“Police officers are consistently monitoring departing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo preventive breathing tests before leaving," she added.
Dozens of law enforcement officers oversee the event, foreign police, transport and law enforcement officers are on the scene, and there are also service dogs in the emergency room.
"During today, police officers checked 470 people moving at the scene of the action and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, six of them sitting behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for the presence of ominous and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Police have also dealt with 14 traffic violations.
At the request of the technoparty participants, the police conducted 300 preventive breathing tests and four preventive tests on the presence of ominous and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene.
Prime Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) said on the TV show Prima Partie.
However, the number of participants decreased to less than 1000, the police assessed that the intervention was not necessary, and neither did the hygiene station or the Ministry of Health request it.
Czech TV (<0xC4><0x8C>T) said on Sunday that the technoparties had expanded to surrounding areas, whose owners did not agree with the use for technoparties.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation for the damage.
Techna supporters on the pitch at Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota arrived on Friday evening.
The police initially watched the meadow in Bla<0xC5><0xBE>ima, Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovska, where the technoparty took place last Friday.
Bla<0xC5><0xBE>im is located about 30 kilometers from Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota, where technicians actually sit.
According to Novakov<0xC3><0xA1>, no one came to Bla<0xC5><0xBE>ima.
Snake bite: The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"This year's first case was recorded in Norway.
The snake stabbed the girl in the foot there, the year 2010, which the parents themselves brought to the base of the rescue service, "said M<0xC3><0xA1>ria Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, a regional spokesman for the medical rescue service, with the child being taken to the hospital in Klatov.
Snakes are the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in <0xC5><0xA0>umava that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to pay attention when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that a snake will bite you isn’t too high, when you’re in regular contact, you’re afraid of yourself.
And if he has room for it, he likes to get away after a loud whistling.
They attack only if they feel very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
Its bite, however, is not a tragedy, its venom is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism, or suffers from allergies.
Therefore, the risk of danger is mainly in children, seniors and allergy sufferers.
"A person often has a feeling of vomiting after sneezing, sweats, has an increased temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, in weakened individuals and especially allergic people can cause anaphylactic shock," she wrote.
The man threatened to throw the babies out the window.
After the policeman lil wine and a bowl of dishes
After 23:00, the intervention unit entered the apartment and the man was detained.
Kojence immediately took care of the doctors, said in a press release the spokesman of the regional police, Markéta Janovsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, after the police negotiator threw the dishes, knives or poured wine from the window.
He strengthened his threats several times during the negotiation by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
Once, he even climbed up to the parapet of the window where he was lying.
Police are still investigating the man.
Further information is not yet published.
Stosurov<0xC3><0xA1> will give preference to daughter before tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur won’t make it to the coronavirus-influenced season this year.
Sixty-year-old U.S. Open 2011 champion, who became a mother in June, but still does not want to end her career.
He plans to return to court next year and believes that thanks to his family and his daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Two weeks ago on social media, she announced that her partner Liz Astling gave birth to her daughter Genevieve in mid-June.
“I’ll stay home, spend time with my family, be with all the little milestones that our Evie will experience in the next six months, and just enjoy it,” the former world champion said on the Australian League’s website.
The WTA Tour will resume the interrupted season from March 3rd with an oncology tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Once discovered meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the area transported 1,320 pieces of turtle eggs of unknown origin, in addition to inconvenient conditions.
Also, these eggs will be disposed of in the asana business," the State Veterinary Administration said.
During the inspection of the stand with live fish, it was found that the seller has no proof of origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problem from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
For example, in autumn last year, veterinarians discovered an illegal food store in it, with almost half a ton of unlabeled food without proof of origin.
For the most part, the date of consumption could not be ascertained, some of the products had a past shelf life and were damaged.
At five kilograms of sepia, the expiration date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians with police officers in the market area detained 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, olives or frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.
Putin called Zelensky ahead of the start of the ceasefire in Donbas, the Kremlin criticises planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbas, where he is due to start paying a new truce from midnight.
Putin, according to the Kremlin statement, among other things, criticized the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
On Wednesday evening, the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia agreed to support the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The truce is to begin at midnight on Monday, be "complete and general" and open the way to further provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin said in an interview with Zelensky that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections is against the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian parliament last week decided that the upcoming elections to local representatives would not take place in the territory controlled by the pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement foresees that Kiev will regain control of the borders of the Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after providing these regions with broad autonomy and holding local elections there.
According to the Union Agency, the Green Office stated that both States agreed on the benefits of the forthcoming ceasefire in Donbas and the need to take further measures to support the peace in the region, such as demining the fighting areas or withdrawing some of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called for the release of Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, on the occupied peninsula of Crimea and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped to stop the fighting, but in occasional shelling and artillery attacks on both sides of the front, people continue to die.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed more than 14,000 deaths since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky made the end of the war in Donbas his priority, but there has not yet been a major breakthrough in the negotiations.
The unexpected master of the decade is Rykl, the seventh master of Novotn<0xC3><0xA1>
The defender of the last two titles Dole<0xC5><0xBE>al did not reach the conclusion of the Saturday program of the four-stroke, Kopeck<0xC3><0xBD> did not jump the base in the pole on Sunday.
Tenetiboji was long ruled by the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing for the group coach Josef Karas, but resigned after the disc.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs so far, this time he was the only ten-year-old to get across the seven-thousand-thousand-thousand-thousand border.
Other medals were won by Vilém Str<0xC3><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> and Petr Urb<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
After the competition, Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> S<0xC3><0xBD>kora.
“It’s a shame that there weren’t guys here and Kope didn’t put up because that would look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I gave myself a person about 30 centimeters away.
Then the stick made me happy and the most disappointing was probably the disc, there I was under-average," he said on his Facebook page.
On the first day of the seven-fight, she won with more than a hundred points, despite being afflicted by a wounded ankle on the reflex leg.
However, in the long-distance sector, she recorded only 570 cm, did not pass 40 meters and did not enter the final eight.
Novotn<0xC3><0xA1> collected 5878 points and won 241 points ahead of Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
It has come a long way, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around the 630s.
“Yesterday I started to get pulled over, but I’m so glad that I didn’t feel it at all and that it didn’t limit me at all,” Novotn<0xC3><0xA1> said on her Facebook page.
Organic LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its significantly lower price than petrol or oil, given a significantly lower consumption tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre.
Like gasoline and oil, it also has its environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
However, this is entirely new - on the European market there first appeared curtains and, according to the press report of the Czech Association LPG, arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago.
"These days we received the first fifteen tonnes of organic LPG, which will be distributed to our pumping station in combination with the classic fossil LPG," says the association Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Karl<0xC3><0xAD>k from Primagas.
However, organic LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or bionaphtha.
According to the association, it is chemically similar to the classic oil LPG, which many motorists are now tanking in their cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions arbitrarily.
"The only difference compared to the classic LPG is the way of production," says Ivan Indr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, president of the association.
This is said to be one of the great benefits of organic LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and also the distribution infrastructure is relatively good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced targeted, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. wood waste.
On the other hand, classical oil LPG is partly produced as a by-product of refining oil, partly by separation in the mining of natural gas.
As a result, depending on the technology of production and sources, the operation of cars for organic LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation of oil LPG and up to 90% compared to oil.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the so-called "well-to-tank" part (Czech "from source to tank").
One of the largest producers of organic LPG currently includes petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M), Unipetrol is also investigating the possibility of production in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to estimates of the association in the Czech Republic, about 170,000 vehicles drive on LPG; the Ministry of the Environment reports in NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M a slightly higher number, about 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 LPG-powered car conversions were carried out last year alone.
In the Czech Republic, LPG can be refueled at about 950 stations of different operators.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch reviewed the number of infected, the number dropped by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for the UN) ordered the ministry to revise the number of coronavirus infections.
New statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The number fell from 5,254 to 3,479 on Saturday afternoon, down from 1,775.
Currently, there are 3,422 patients in the Czech Republic.
“With the number of people being cured increasing, there is a review of data that has not been able to update hygiene recently,” said Jaroslav Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people were infected with coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 were cured and 371 Covid-19 diseases unfortunately succumbed.
Mobile Electoral Units or Correspondence Choice.
Political scientist and sociologist looking for options for the pandemic
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), the law needs to be changed to allow people to vote in quarantine in the October regional and Senate elections because of the coronavirus.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He said it on Sunday in the Prima TV Party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions at the ministry with representatives of the parliamentary parties.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hama<0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the framework of the current legal rules.
However, the minister said that the provisions of the law will need to be amended, according to which people in quarantine cannot vote because of the state of health.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop in the OVM series stated that the possibility of correspondence elections has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then counts on its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, the breakthrough considers the concerns of the ANO or the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather record to other types of parties) of the correspondence choice to be overvalued.
He is personally opposed to the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Kl<0xC3><0xAD>ma said that now it is necessary ad hoc to devise mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out already this year and with as little health risk as possible.
The main thing is to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
Correspondence choice (whether in a foreign country or in the Czech Republic) is considered one of the functional methods.
As others, they see the aforementioned electoral units or perhaps the possibility of a proxy vote within the family.
He added that there is an opportunity to learn how similar situations - the elections in the time of the coronavirus - were resolved in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of coronavirus, various types of elections have already been postponed this year in 67 countries of the world.
Protests in Bulgaria: Pig ears thrown at government building by protesters
The participants of the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyk Borissov and his cabinet shook their ears at the government building.
It was another of a series of protests against the "Mafia style of rule" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, the DPA agency said.
According to Radio Svobodn<0xC3><0xA1> Evropa/Radio Svoboda, the protest, which took place on the 18th day in a row, had a weaker participation than the previous one.
At 20:00, about 300 people met, some streets had to be closed for transportation.
Protesters in front of the government building played a stage in which they symbolically closed the prison cell of Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Ge<0xC5><0xA1>ev in connection with the arrest of two advisers of President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the government.
Renunciation of both is one of the basic demands of the protestors.
They also demanded the repeal of the announced health reform and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organiser of the protests, Nikolai Hadjigenov, said Wednesday that the "top of the escalation" in the form of "a nationwide demonstration in Sofia and a blockade across the country."
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the postponement of early elections.
The correct ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov had previously said that he did not intend to resign.
He justified, among other things, the need for Bulgaria to carry out the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, although the resignation of the protesters did not calm down.
Earlier this week, Borisov’s government stopped voting in parliament on confidence in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovic no longer wants matches without spectators
Football coach Boloni Sini<0xC5><0xA1> Mihajlovi<0xC4><0x8D> already has enough matches of the Italian league without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that from the new season fans will return to the stadiums.
“What we are doing right now is not football.
I've got my teeth full of matches without spectators.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
These games are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I don’t think I’m the only one who thinks so,” Mihajlovic said ahead of today’s match against Lecce.
After the coronavirus break, the Série A matches follow quickly, and although they are played until the evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in a terrible heat.
Under such conditions, he doesn't even know how the teams are on it.
Let's get this season over with.
These measures had to be taken to win the competition, but I hope fans will be back from September," said the coach, who also led Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovic, this season is also unusual because he missed four months on the bench due to the treatment of leukemia.
“Despite my illness, the suspension of the league and everything else, our team has managed to move up the level.
We want to continue to grow and we need to make the players mentally stronger,” he said.
We have become the target of cyberattacks by foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and enterprises.
Some Iranian officials said the fire, which broke out this month in an underground nuclear operation in Natanz, could have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mussavi told Iranian media that the Islamic Republic’s infrastructure is facing “thousands of cyberattacks” every day.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them manage to bounce back.
In recent months, according to Mus<0xC3><0xA1>v<0xC3><0xAD>, several broader cyberattacks have been recorded, which according to the analysis were "certain governments and groups".
However, details of possible perpetrators were not disclosed, according to Reuters.
Musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in the summer.
An article by Iran’s state agency IRNA this month argued that Iran’s enemies, such as Israel and the United States, could stand for recent incidents.
None of these countries, however, were directly accused of the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-term strained relations between the two countries intensified in 2018 after Washington stepped down from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the world powers and imposed sanctions against Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi Muhandise on January 3.
Then on January 8, Iran fired at the bases in Iraq, where the Americans operate, the amount of rockets.
The U.S. admits that dozens of U.S. soldiers have been wounded.
Israel considers Iran its main enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop a nuclear bomb, which Iran denies.
The TPCA car has extended the production stop, now until May 25
The carmaker Toyota Peugeot Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n Automobile (TPCA) has again extended production suspension due to the coronavirus.
Production lines are due to resume on Monday, May 25th.
The attack will be accompanied by dozens of hygiene measures, car spokeswoman Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Paroubek said.
The production is due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
The company originally planned to renovate it on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extension of the break is the closed border and the closed dealership, according to Paroubka, so no one has to sell the car.
According to Paroubka, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, i.e. two exchanges.
The coronavirus affects the company’s key markets, such as Italy, Great Britain or Spain.
Mayor Michael Ka<0xC5><0xA1>par (Change for Cologne) said that the withdrawal of production in the TPCA is not signed on life in the city.
"From the beginning it was known, in the city it was empty.
But the street is gradually filling up, especially now since Monday, when it has been a lot of fun.
So the city is full," said Kaspar.
According to him, there are no complications even with foreign workers who stayed in the hostels.
"We didn't have to solve almost any problem in those two months," Ka<0xC5><0xA1>par said.
For example, <0xC5><0xA0>koda Auto, which also stopped production due to the coronavirus crisis, renewed it on Monday 27 April in all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Not one of the cars has a 100 percent capacity.
The restoration of production in <0xC5><0xA0>koda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, the third night shift took place in Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav and Kvasin<0xC3><0xA1> for the first time after the restoration of production.
About 2,500 people are currently working at TPCA and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time employees in Cologne.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: Leave a message to the family
For more than two years, she had been battling cancer of her own, Gemma Sisson, and when it appeared that she had been battling cancer, the disease began to reoccur.
A 19-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding eventually ended up in bed in a hospice, where she was still able to take her love of life.
Unfortunately, the disaster has subsided.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her social media account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from English Leeds, loved bodybuilding.
With his friend Ricky Moore, with whom he lived for more than 16 years, they traveled around the world.
A 19-year-old woman was sporting and living healthy, but she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began an exhausting treatment, radiation therapy, in the hope that she would recover.
After months of treatment, it actually seemed that Gemma managed to win over the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked the spine.
A bodybuilder and personal trainer reportedly underwent a ten-hour spinal surgery, according to the British daily Mirror, and then she began a drastic treatment again.
Of course, it was all wasted.
At the beginning of this year, on her fiftieth birthday, doctors announced to her that she had a few months to live.
Finally, in April, a handsome blonde decided to join a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged a wedding to her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky last took Gemmu to the restaurant for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
A few hours after her death, Gema posted a post on her social media account for her family.
"If this has been made public, it means I've finally died after weeks of too long a fight.
Although I will have a broken heart that I leave my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can’t thank Ricky enough, who has been by my side the whole time and has given me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time,” she wrote on social media that the pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
“I’m also grateful for all the support I’ve received from all my followers on social media,” she wrote, adding that everyone should value their life and live it fully.
Machines for the art sell a travel list, mushroom amulet and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, the next handicraft will be obtained by most beginning Czech artists.
Images and other creations create directly for the artmat, so they know in advance that they must fit in the size of 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always a curatorial text about the artist in the package and then the work itself," said project curator Petra Wid<0xC5><0xBE>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer can thus be surprised what kind of artwork he gets.
Currently, she can become the new owner of fantasy illustrations by Alexandra <0xC5><0xA0>toplov<0xC3><0xA1> or mini-views by Teresa Bonaventure, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23 in collaboration with Dora Dutkov<0xC3><0xA1> has prepared a pexeso associated with the Prague walk.
The cards need to be paired with the home signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrov<0xC3><0xA1> and Juliana Chomov<0xC3><0xA1> sell handbags of spirituality: the first of the artist offers a protective amulet from the wedding dress and hanging card, the second series of illustrations based on her comic Spiritistka.
Health care salaries will increase by a maximum of five per cent next year.
According to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch, the increase is unrealistic.
Healthcare salaries could rise by a maximum of five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for the UN) said in V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Moravce’s Questions in Czech Television.
The demand of experts for an increase of up to 15 percent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in the provision of protective equipment.
According to him, the hospital now has their supplies.
"I think that the increase in (payments) can be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation in which since March it has intervened in the selection of the coronavirus insurance pandemic and the government regulation against its spread.
The incomes of the insurers fell at that time.
"I think 15 percent of the increase at the moment is unrealistic," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.
The average monthly income of doctors in acute bed care according to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (<0xC3><0x9A>ZIS) is likely to reach 88 312 crowns this year, sisters 47 498 crowns.
The difference between the pay of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The <0xC3><0x9A>ZIS data also shows that the loss of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average salary in the Czech Republic was CZK 34,125 in 2019, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Representatives of experts already in June said that for 2021 they will require a minimum increase of ten percent, ideally by 15 percent.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the income of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be managed by pay tables, and contractual wages in hospitals of cities, regions, or private individuals.
Therefore, they also require that the paytables be uniform for healthcare professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns per month.
For example, in the case of doctors, wages grew faster than wages last year.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber Roman <0xC5><0xA0>muclera, experts should see how this is currently happening.
The House recently approved an increase in this year’s state budget deficit to a record 500 billion kroner, of which 1.75 billion is to go to hospital and social services for health workers.
According to <0xC5><0xA0>muclera, the health care provider’s board disagrees with the flat-rate increase in wages next year.
According to him, the compensation should be decided by the hospitals and medical facilities themselves, and in addition, the money should go to them through the payment declaration.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Pavel <0xC5><0xA0>vagr, the chairman of the State Reserves Administration (SSHR), said this week that the administration does not currently have any protective medical equipment in the property.
Waiting for the selection procedure to be completed.
According to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were bought out.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
They could take over the soldiers with a swirling smart quarantine.
We're ready, they're sending
“A smart quarantine works, there’s something to improve, of course.
We're going to discuss this with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and it is a question of whether they should not run it all over again," the prime minister said on his Facebook page on Sunday.
According to him, it is not possible to connect enough IT systems and hygiene stations, which gradually have to switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were according to the Prime Minister in the Moravian-Silesian region, where they are one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he has no information on Sunday’s negotiations and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
According to him, the army is ready for this step.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until that time, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central command team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, led by former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
The project was criticised by Interior Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) on Sunday.
And he hoped that the army could catch him again.
The shortcomings in the project were previously admitted by the government’s IT and digitalization official Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Dzurilla, who is in charge of it.
“The system works, but it’s still working.
Twenty years it was created independently and unsystemically, now we are trying to unify it in a few months.
It's not a fight.
People on the go, the poor on the hygiene on the go adapt those new systems and actually pick up those mistakes," he said.
Ostrava's Prime Minister Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "crazy in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Macura (ANO), will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the effort to "get lost in politics," he told the server Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the presidency of the UN, has been Prime Minister of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, it won almost a third of the electoral votes of the leading candidate of the UN movement in Ostrava.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
“I thought I was going to last one functional period, and with that business experience, I can turn everything around and stand on my feet,” he said.
He added that in the second election period, he was allowed to negotiate to a certain extent.
"But for me it's the maximum.
I don’t want to fool about politics,” added Macura, who described himself in the interview as a difficult introvert who doesn’t have frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, there has been speculation for a long time about Macro's possible end in the ANO movement.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the ANO movement, for example for allying with the SPD or for supporting Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few UN figures, he supported anti-Zeman candidate Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Draho<0xC5><0xA1> in the elections.
From the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017, Macura is not planning to leave.
“As long as I have the feeling that I can change something in the movement, that it’s not a completely empty fight, and that no one cares about it, I don’t have the immediate motive to end it,” he said.
Sixty-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Prior to becoming the mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served, among other things, as the director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also worked in other companies.
Uber to return to Brno, offering transport services
Uber, which offers transportation services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is the result of a change in the law, said on Thursday in a press release by the City Council of Brno for Transport Petr Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>l (ODS).
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as the designation as a taxi or a taxi meter.
However, the change in the law has changed the conditions for the operation of regular taxis and alternative ones since July.
In the past few weeks, he has held several meetings with representatives of Uber.
Based on them, this company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows this company to operate legally.
The city has been made aware of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>l said.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him for not identifying vehicles as a taxi or a missing taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary injunction that prohibited Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but at the end of last year, Mayor Markéta Vankov<0xC3><0xA1> (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to a later court ruling, Uber was able to drive in Brno, but the company did not use it.
He will now return on the basis of a change of law.
Since July, it has been the case that, in addition to classic taxis with a light bulb and a taxi meter, it is easier to operate the transport service ordered and paid exclusively through the mobile application.
Too noisy a celebration in Brno: the flying chair fell a meter from the man on the sidewalk
From the fourth floor of the apartment, the office chair flew out in Brno on Saturday evening and hit about a meter from the sidewalk.
At that moment, there was a walker who immediately called the guards.
Immediately after arriving at this address in the western part of the city, the guard noticed an open window, under which the chair was still lying and next to it several boxes and non-smoking.
"The hand, which was carried from the room on the fourth floor, indicated that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
The guards walked out of the hallway to the apartment and asked three young men present from the age of sixty to ninety years for an explanation," said a spokesman for the guards, Jakub Ghanem.
Request for Rafaje to speak to Babi<0xC5><0xA1> with the Czech SSR
Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> (ANO) plans on Monday to discuss with the coalition social democrats the request for the resignation of the head of the anti-monopoly office (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS) Petr Rafaje.
Rafa’s appeal was called by non-profit organizations to the anti-corruption council of the government and also the <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj.
Social democrats state that the exchange at the head of the office is in place.
According to information <0xC4><0x8C>TK Rafaj was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second term ends in the middle of next year, according to the law he cannot be appointed a third.
His appeal is within the competence of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman.
In addition to the challenge of non-profit organizations, the prime minister also received a letter with a similar request from the <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> region.
Among other things, Rafa's recent cases should be the reason.
Last week, the Prime Minister declined to comment on the request, saying that he would be familiar with the materials and that the government parties would be interested in "some opinion".
He also said that he has not yet negotiated the challenge with the president, and that he has no meeting with him in the near future.
According to the UOHS statement, there is no reason to appeal because Rafaj was not charged with anything.
The servers of IHNED.cz and Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz last week wrote that the police were interested in Rafa's meetings with the heathman Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC4><0x8C>unk.
The meetings put into context, among other things, with the decision to compete for the project of the controversial new Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n hospital for eight billion, which <0xC4><0x8C>unek is pushing hard.
He admitted that the tone of the meeting, according to him, dealt with his "senate activity" together.
The same is true of Rafa.
The representative of the <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> region called on the government at the end of June to appeal to Rafa.
It also calls for reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the Office.
The decision of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS regarding public procurement according to the Deputy Head of Transport Jaroslav Kom<0xC3><0xAD>nka is not transparent and has its own marks.
In March last year, police intervened in the anti-monopoly office because of a tendency to choose a tortoise.
In June this year, the server Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz pointed out that Rafaj is using apartments written on the company of influential backside player <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Alexandra <0xC4><0x8C>uby.
However, a deposit of 3.5 million per apartment in Brno was paid from Rafa's account.
The President of the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition is Rafaj from 9 July 2009, for the second term of office the President of the former Member of Social Democracy appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafa's second six-year term will expire.
The Anti-Monopoly Office Act states that the President may appeal to the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may be revoked only if it does not perform a function for more than six months or seriously impairs the dignity of its function or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the library, the employees were snorkeling.
Helps with air conditioning
The new technology will cost 740,000 and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
With three children we go to the library in the center of Blanca on a regular basis.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to endure.
There was terrible heat and bad air.
Winding didn't help.
That’s why I like the air conditioning,” said one of the Blaenna readers Petr Novotn<0xC3><0xBD>.
According to the director of the library Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Dlapa, the temperature in the building often exceeded 30 degrees.
The southern wall of the object is glassy and in sunny days it acts as a greenhouse.
"In addition, thanks to the curvature of the building, the sun rests on a large part of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem for individual departments to ventilate, because during the night the windows must be closed for safety reasons.
We often have from morning in the library to thirty degrees," Dlapa said.
The worst part was the studio and the library on the third floor.
And about the floor above then the exhibition room and the director.
The uncomfortable climate was also in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
Several times it happened that the librarians at work were collapsing and ended up in job incompetence.
The problem also occurred regularly in the cultural room at lectures, which are attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, I couldn’t breathe anymore,” Dlapa said.
Originally, the city’s representatives wanted to do air conditioning this year in all areas of the library.
In the end, there will be only three out of five circles.
“Because of limited funding, air conditioning will have only the most problematic spaces.
Studio and library on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children’s department are up the floor,” said Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Svoboda of the Blanen Investment Committee.
He added that in the first phase, workers already installed air technology in the above-mentioned areas in the autumn of last year and adjusted the electrical installations.
About 360,000 crowns.
The City Library of Blansko has almost three thousand registered readers.
That's about nine hundred to fifteen years.
Chicago's defense has eliminated the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game.
Not all of the infected athletes will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to a player from the NHL who is silent about the health of the players as a tomb and does not disclose anything at all.
As one of the few, he emerged from the Crawford series.
A 15-year-old Montreal native was only present in the first training session, since then he has been missing in the squad.
"I would like to inform you all that I have been tested positive for Covid-19 and because of this I have spent the last fourteen days locked up in my house," he said.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to jump back into a full load.
"It's amazing that I'm back.
I will do everything I can to get into shape as soon as possible," he added.
The experienced goalkeeper has won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the pitch being the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks are first waiting for a pre-season duel with St. Louis, then they will face Edmonton in the lead.
Thousands of Israelis protest against Prime Minister
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country have protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is handling the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstrations took place in front of Netanyahu’s private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been taking place regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
Their participants demand the resignation of Netanyahu because of the process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as because of how the government is tackling the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one of the protesters wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's widely known nickname.
"Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes," he said.
Seventy-year-old Netanyahu is Israel’s first prime minister to be tried in office.
He is charged in three cases of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He rejects all charges and calls them witch-hunts.
According to local media, the trial can last up to three years, more than 300 witnesses are summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in Israel, which has a population of about nine million, has been confirmed by nearly 60,500 people.
455 people have died in connection with the infection.
In March, the Israeli government introduced a quarantine measure that helped reduce the daily increase in infections.
After the gradual release of restrictions from the end of April, however, especially at the end of June, the numbers of infected again began to grow significantly.
Critics of Netanyahu claim that the government has not sufficiently helped, for example, nutritionists affected by quarantine measures.
The protestors are also concerned that the government, in the fight against coronavirus, is issuing places of disparate instruction.
The driver smashed the car into a tree and died.
The body had to cut off the firemen from the wreckage.
The tragic accident occurred at about 23:00 at Neveklova in a narrow district leading from the Slapsk<0xC3><0xA1> dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the forest at a considerable speed and smashed the car into a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be freed from the wreckage by firefighters, among other things, cutting off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are checked by the police.
They ordered a court drink, which should explain, among other things, whether the man did not drive under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
End with wasting and squeezing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is deserting a fundamental change in strategy.
It cancels the discounts and no longer wants to tick one collection after the other.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the largest polluters of the environment is nothing new.
Billions of pieces of clothing end up in incinerators and warehouses every year.
The view of slow fashion, often a neglected approach to clothing, but in recent years it has changed quite rapidly.
About half of Pietro Filipi’s goods were sold at full price.
The second half, which was sold thanks to discounts, simply won’t buy.
The company does not want to spoil one collection after another and at the end of each season products discount below their production price.
In addition, according to the owner Michal Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka, the era of new and old collections and the blind following of rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most discounted traders already count on the purchase of goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it’s actually a bit of a scam,” says owner Pietro Filipi Michal Micka.
In addition, the company wants to support local businesses with its approach.
“Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality materials and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothes that are timeless and seasonal.
Worldwide, the segment of premium brands without any discount is typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary,” adds Micka.
The Great Graffiti presents the flight of RAF Kurt Taussig
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remember our fighter pilot, who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal was liked by the management of the city," said Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
At the same time, he consumed about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish background, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp where he was held for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid a concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig arrived in the United Kingdom, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and subsequently underwent pilot training in South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He was involved in combat operations at the beginning of 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Kamil Vacek, a sixty-year-old who has been known by people in the street graphic arts industry as Camo, has been working on spraying in the warm streets for over 20 years.
Graffiti began on the surfaces, which were separated by the then prime minister Jaroslav Kubera (ODS) for these purposes.
Hurricane Hanna arrives on the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the southwest coast of the U.S. state of Texas on Saturday afternoon (before midnight SEL<0xC4><0x8C> tonight).
He hit Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of the town of Port Mansfield, and as he moved above the fort he weakened to a tropical storm.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought with it a strong wind and intense collisions; along with local floods, according to the AP, there are reports of power outages and various material damage, among other damaged ships.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Saturday declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas and recommended people to voluntarily evacuate.
The strongest warning was received by people from the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but he has lived to strike an area nearly 500 kilometers long before moving gradually over northeastern Mexico.
“Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, strong rain and wind, rising levels, dangerous flooding, and a unique tornado can pose a threat,” warned the National Hurricane Center (NHC).
This morning local time (afternoon SEL<0xC4><0x8C>) the storm was moving in the area of the U.S.-Mexico border and accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
On Saturday, Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season.
It was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour over the Gulf of Mexico, but it gradually dropped to 112 kilometers per hour as it moved to the mainland, which once again drove Hanna out of the hurricane category.
Local authorities have called for storms to pass at home and not to forget the sanitary measures associated with the prevention of the spread of coronavirus.
Texas is one of the U.S. states that is the most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Given the current security measures and the need to comply with the derogations, evacuations are also a major challenge.
Provisional shelters have been opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In the Hidalgo district of Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter after being evacuated, who had a positive coronavirus test or were otherwise exposed to the infection.
Local authorities have called on all evacuees to take their clothes and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter, if possible.
“We don’t have it far behind us yet.
We expect catastrophic flooding," said AP agency Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in Brownsville.
Forecasts say that in some places, in just a few hours, up to 300 millimeters of precipitation could burst, in some cases at least 500 millimeters, which together with rising sea levels could flood a number of coastal sites.
Zeman to lend general value to Colonel Lipk
On Wednesday, President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman will lend the general value to Colonel Pavel Lipkov.
This is based on an overview of the Ministry of Defence's expected events.
The reason for renting the value of the Brigadier General is the August arrival of Lipka to the post of deputy commander of the alliance’s multinational division in north-eastern Poland.
Lipka still acts as a representative of the commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
Zeman's elevation at the end of June was proposed by the government.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karl <0xC5><0x98>ehk as the representative of the commander of the Multinational Division of the Northeast in the Polish Elblag, which commands the units of the alliance's forward presence in the territory of Poland and the Baltic.
In March, she became the director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NUKIB).
The government has proposed to the president to lend the rank of Brigadier General to Lipk.
Under the Occupational Soldiers Act, a higher value may be leased to a soldier for the period of performance of the function chosen or for the period of performance of the service task required by the lease of a higher value.
The position of the representative of the commander of the alliance division corresponds to the general value.
The soldier to whom the value has been leased has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that value.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that would correspond to that value.
The lease of the value shall take into account the reason for which it was granted.
"Lieutenant Lipka demonstrates a high level of professional readiness and is a role model for subordinates.
In a significant way, it participates in the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the defense ministry said in June on the proposal to increase.
The Wednesday promotion will take place at 12:30 in Prague Castle, will be attended by Defence Minister Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Metnar or Chief of the General Staff Ale<0xC5><0xA1> Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
The European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for aircraft travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is compliance with the departure or wearing of clothes at the aircraft and at the airport, but the intermediate seats on the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
She informed the Reuters news agency.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to meet these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement was concluded by officials and that it still has to be formally approved by the ministers.
The agreed measures include a requirement to cover the mouth and nose of passengers from six years of age, to comply with the recommended deviation during security checks and take-off at the airport.
Ample fresh air must also be guaranteed on board the aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
The airlines will also be able to occupy the central seats.
The common rules on which officials have agreed to comply with at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards have caused a lot of confusion.
On the Arctic peaks, the temperature record fell, measured there almost 22 degrees
“A 41-year-old record fell in Longyearbyen,” the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the afternoon, the temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, surpassing the record for 1979 by 0.4 degrees, he added.
Longyearbyen is the largest city in <0xC5><0xA0>picberk<0xC3><0xA1>, located about 1300 kilometers from the north pole.
Spicy peppers heat up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers arising from the warming of other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies last year.
According to him, the average temperature in <0xC5><0xA0>picberk<0xC3><0xA1> has increased by three to five degrees from the 70s of the 20th century.
By 2100, it could even rise by ten degrees, if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced in the atmosphere.
The increase in temperature in <0xC5><0xA0>picberk<0xC3><0xA1> may result in the erosion of permanently frozen soil, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can also cause a greater amount of avalanches and droughts of the soil.
The warming of the climate also threatens Arctic fauna, such as ice bears or tulips, which are dependent on the ice cover of the ocean.
The British, who will return from Spain, are waiting for mandatory two-week quarantine
The UK’s cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all roads to mainland Spain that are not necessary due to the risk of spreading COVID-19.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are thus not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people have to isolate for two weeks.
The new rules enter into force at midnight.
“Protection of public health is our top priority.
"We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," the British foreign ministry said in a statement.
“We’ve always made it clear that if it’s needed, we’ll immediately remove a certain country from the list of safe ones,” she added.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Spain.
Among other things, the British are concerned about whether they will be paid sick leave in case they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after their return from the holiday.
Neil Hunter of Sittingbourne, for example, had a ten-day holiday in Lanzarote, scheduled to depart on Tuesday.
Check-in has been ordered since December.
“We were supposed to go all the family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don’t know what will happen.
I work as a car driver and I don’t think my employer will agree to be quarantined after returning from a two-week vacation,” said Metro Hunter.
In connection with Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
During the last two days, there have always been over 900 new infections in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening up coronavirus measures, for example, Catalonia is trying to curtail all night life and prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has again warned of the increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, Basque Country and the Madrid region.
Dukovan's Electricity Purchase Model Talks Government
On Monday, the government will discuss a model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new block of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill is based on the fact that if the purchase price is higher than the price of electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer will be the opposite.
Power is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for the customers.
The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek (for the UN) and the energy company <0xC4><0x8C>EZ have previously stated that the more likely option is that people will be saved by the construction of electricity.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, which has shown developments in the past several times.
The plan has previously been criticized by environmental organizations.
“The wholesale price can be both below the market price of electricity and above it.
The final impact at the time of applicability of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the fuse - at lower consumption or according to the consumption of electricity - at higher consumption of electricity," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in a statement.
Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek said in May that he expects the wholesale price of electricity to grow and people on the Dukovan building will make money.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns per year per family, which is far less than people pay annually in bills for electricity in support of so-called backed resources.
Previously, he estimated that the purchase price could range from 50 to 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal for the amount, it is to be included only in the redemption contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, which is now the most available to traders, is currently around 45 euros (about CZK 1190) per MWh.
"The difference between the purchase price and the market price of electricity in the amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 could make the average household supplement with consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - can correspond to four-member households, equipped as standard with electrical appliances, but not with electrical appliances, including electric appliances, but not with electric appliances.
“We are living in a very turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a speculative matter," said Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Voltr, CEO of the Energy financial group.
The proposed law takes into account the fact that the redemption would be carried out by the MPO, or the legal entity entrusted by it, owned by the State at a pre-determined price.
The agreement between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, including repeated, but not longer than the end of the operation of low-carbon production.
The low-carbon production design defines as the production of electricity with a nuclear reactor connected to an electrification system with an installed capacity of a minimum of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek previously stated that the new Dukovan block should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to dozens of expected Czech consumption.
The block is expected to go into operation in 2036.
The funding model for the new Dukovan bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the state without a year-on-year, with an interest rate of two per cent for the operation.
She disagrees with the funding model of the opposition, and is also concerned about the possibility that Dukovany would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The state is expected to contribute 70 percent to the construction.
The rest should be paid by <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which will also cover all possible additional costs.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ Director General Daniel Bene<0xC5><0xA1> in May <0xC4><0x8C>TK said that the expected sum for the building of the block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Agreements between the state and the Czech Republic on the construction of a new Dukovan bloc will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has withdrawn material to support tourism in the media for two billion
The material, according to which the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to spend in the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising for holidays in the Czech Republic, was withdrawn by the authorities from the commemorative proceedings.
Minister Kl<0xC3><0xA1>ra Dost<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> (for ANO) of the server SeznamZr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>ty.cz said that she is still working on the material.
The document in the eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) was alerted on Friday by the server Zdopravy.cz.
The ministry's plan justified the collapse of the travel traffic due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, there was a decline in revenue and the media.
The proposal sparked criticism from the opposition and representatives of the tourism movement.
According to the proposal, which is now to be viewed on the website hlidacstatu.cz, the MMR planned to give money to advertising in televisions, radios, print, the Internet, billboards or platforms on the stations through the state agency to support the CzechTourism tourism movement.
The biggest part of the money, that's 700 million kroner, would get TV.
Most of them would get private TVs Nova and Prima.
Printed journals and weekly newspapers would receive $400 million and the same piece would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive $350 million for the media campaign, most of them private stations again.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces at stations or on the subway.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was to start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still being worked on, definitely not in the form that should be presented," Dostalov<0xC3><0xA1> said without further details of the server.
The material criticized the opposition, according to the head of the TOP 09 Marketa Pekarova Adamov<0xC3><0xA1>, the media would benefit from the advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this shown contempt will get in the fall in the election of the morning between the eyes," she wrote on Twitter.
It is quite clear that this is in fact a media aid crisis.
"It may be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support at all," she said on Friday.
According to him, the budget is two billion oriental.
“Of course, we’re still calculating it, it can be less and more.
It’s work,” she added.
On the initiative Save Tourism does not give the media campaign the sense to support domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for travel companies, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Bar<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k, president of the initiative, said on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
Starting from life, brewing beer and death as a grass stem
A death is also the third album called A death is the trunk of the grass of the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher of Jaroslav Erik Fri<0xC4><0x8D>e, who also left a year ago, on May 24.
In Fri<0xC4><0x8D>ov's discography, he is the fifth item and, like in previous titles, also here is the main emphasis on Fri<0xC4><0x8D>ov's poetry, which is itself an excellent interpreter.
Frich, born in 1949, was of course influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration came from his own personal experiences and also very internal manifestations of faith.
However, there was some agitation at the stake, whether he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
I think in that context of Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast, perhaps to Jan Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek), the master will pass.
Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s album offers recordings of the 2006 author's reading, as well as performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was the cellist Josef Kl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>, or Honza Barto<0xC5><0x88> and V<0xC3><0xAD>t<0xC4><0x9B>zslav Holata.
I will help - I like - the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka about Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s long poems.
"It sent pride and unending bitterness out of them," writes Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka, "over the condition of our world threatened by extinction.
The world, which is increasingly falling into a bloated consumption of vanity and greed, is increasingly moving away from what its soul was created from - the mystery of faith, humility, and human closeness.
In them was called the rod of the one who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest, but who also knows that it is only because of the general disinterest that they cannot be dropped.
These poems reminded us that a person may have to miss everything expensive, but it doesn’t matter in what way he gets it.
If he sells himself to a general slump, he sceptically resigns, intimidatingly shuts down, or remains until the last moment in a quiet and proud persistence in what he believes and what he loves.
“A parody is not my adviser,” Hama<0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
The former prime minister and president of the Czech SSR Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek is not a paid social democracy adviser.
The party president and Interior Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hama<0xC4><0x8D>ek said it today on the TV show Prima Partie.
The fact that Paroubek should be Hama<0xC4><0x8D>ka’s advisor was reported on Friday by the server SeznamZr<0xC3><0xA1>hy.cz.
"We write an essay from time to time, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it," Hama<0xC4><0x8D>ek said today.
However, he added that it is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD does not have the means to waste it for similar purposes.
"Sometimes I read his opinion, so there are a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana <0xC4><0x8C>ernochova, the Minister said that many ODS members are still “indiscreetly listening to the views of V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus”.
According to him, this is okay, because it is an experienced politician and a former party president, which is also the case of Paroubka.
The fact that the media is making an affair, he called the mark of this year’s cucumber season.
Server SeznamReport.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek is acting as Hama<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the party's fourth-place candidate in the Utsk region is headed by former cell president Petr Benda, who is linked to Paroubek and has served as deputy chairman of his party LEV 21.
Hama<0xC4><0x8D>ek said today that the composition of the candidate will not comment until it is finished and approved.
Duplantis has a mile jump, it's a kick in the ass, annoys the Swedish challenger
The 22-year-old American bullfighter has the ambition and potential to be one of the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it’s like to beat a two-year-old Duplantis, who beat him last year at a meeting of the NCAA University Association.
"We had a battle a year before, then he won and I was second, then we went through it.
In both cases it was a very good fight," says Nilsen, who secured the victory with a performance of 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has since fired a steep upward shot and is currently isolated in the highest barbed wire spheres.
In just 20 years he became a world record holder, this year on 8 February in Toru<0xC5><0x84> he surpassed the latka at 6.17 meters, a week later in Glasgow he added another centimeter.
"He's been jumping six metres since he was 18 when he graduated from high school," Nilsen told the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that as soon as he got from a boy to a man, all of his potential and talent multiplied by ten.
“Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump the world record,” he said.
Although Nilsen’s success count is slimmer about knowing than Duplantis’s pride, an American sets himself similar goals.
He indicated his chances so far at the NCAA races, which he regularly won, this February he improved on one of them an internal personal record to 5.93 m. Last August he won a gold medal at the Panamerican Games in Lima, already in 2017 he fought in the U.S. Cup World Cup.
The nearest milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
“It’s definitely my priority to get to the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because there you can make a name for yourself,” he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly lead as well on events such as the Olympic Games, the World Cup or the Panamerican Games."
Due to the pandemic, however, these top holidays are postponed, giving Nilsen and other rodents time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five laps into a mere silver fight?
“Everyone is trying to reach it, but I don’t think it will be possible in the near future,” Nilsen thinks.
"That kid's been jumping for 16 years, and he's got a mile jump over all the other guys in training."
And before Tokyo 2021, he will want to increase it even further.
A woman has spent hundreds of thousands of years on a disability pension for a disabled child.
The court is waiting for her
The money a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is intended primarily to improve the quality of his life.
A woman faces up to eight years in prison for treason.
Because of his poor health, the court acquitted the sick man of his own free will, and established a guardianship for his mother, who was to manage his son’s money, among other things.
“A woman from mid-November 2013 to January this year used part of her son’s disability pension funds for her needs and prepared it for 440,000 crowns,” police spokesman Dana Ladman said, accusing the accused woman of having to beg for bail.
A woman, according to the court order, set up an account for her son, but her pension was sent to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with the son's stay in the medical facility and the reimbursement of the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to buy a vehicle, electrical appliances and for the running of the household," the complaint reads.
That he can't use his son's money for his needs, the woman admitted.
She argued, however, that she helped with the family expenses.
“We had problems with our incomes to tighten the pace of the household.
We've never bought anything super-standard.
It was always about the things that my son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," she told the police.
She promised to give the money back to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding tools
Findings from the Chiquihuite cave in Mexico’s Zacatecas state include 1930 limestone tools, among which are fine blades that could be used for cutting meat, and pointed objects that could serve as spikes or spears.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the instruments date from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
“There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and the lead author of one of two studies published on the subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments reach the age of 12,500 years.
According to experts, the people of the Chiquihuite cave, located at a great altitude, lived for 20,000 years.
So far, the widely accepted theory has been that the first representatives of the genus Homo sapiens crossed the mainland bridge from today’s Russia in Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including the unique spikes used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this Clovis culture subsequently spread to much of North America.
However, this model has suffered a break in recent decades, when several ancient sediments were discovered that were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, describes 42 different locations across North America that prove a human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could have come to the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some of them were able to get to the United States.
"It is clear that people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture," said Ruth Gruhn, an anthropologist at the University of Alberta in Canada.
The interest in tickets is so far filled with an optimistic scenario, the sellers say.
Prices are also falling gradually.
Flight sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
In contrast to last summer, interest is still about half, but demand is growing by up to 20 percent each week.
The post-crisis development thus, according to the sellers, fulfills the most optimistic scenario.
The prices of the flights are also gradually falling.
Among the most sought after destinations are, according to the sellers, especially the South European countries.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
At Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz, flights to Split are the most sold.
From other countries, the UK is the most sought after, which, of course, has always been one of the most sought-after destinations.
The average price of the flights is also reduced.
At the Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz portal, about 6250 crowns were moved in the middle of the month, annually by 3000 crowns less.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for a European destination, which now accounts for about 85 percent of sales.
However, the prices themselves are falling in some European places, for example, in Spain or Italy, they have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behavior of customers who are now buying tickets much less in advance than before, as they fear the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to previous information Kiwi.com, the ticket purchase time before departure has been reduced by about ten days each year.
“This is confirmed by the future trend where people will order flights with much less advance, require more flexibility, take less risk,” said Michal Shindel<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>, vice president of Kiwi.com products.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with sales growth, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
At Prague Airport, there are currently regular routes to more than 60 destinations.
In the summer season, it is about half the destination.
The big finale is tonight!
Watch the Battle of the Arrows live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization has entered the grand final.
It features experienced 19-year-old Scottish sprinter Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then bumped into his neighbor in the table top.
However, he also managed with James Wad, and in the quarter-finals he made good contact with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home a world number one.
"Flying Scott" was almost in the semifinals when he faced Michael Smith.
At the last moment, however, he escaped the graver from the shovel, dominated the extension and after the result 18:16 he fought a place in the final of the tournament, which he controlled already in 2018, when he defeated Mensura Suljovi<0xC4><0x8D> in the amazing battle 21:19.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent enjoys the tournament and perhaps knowing that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on a completely fantastic wave.
The six-year-old batsman first surprisingly knocked out the world's sixth Nathan Aspinall, in a dramatic battle they overtook Joa Cullen, and in the quarter-finals after a sharp start, he defeated Adrian Lewis.
The big test was the semi-finals.
Glen Durrant immediately showed his strength at the start, but in the calm playing Belgian he then gained an excellent series, which he then held on to more or less without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in the high-scoring, occasional uncertainty of doubles.
Coronavirus cases have come at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the discovery of the new coronavirus in the Czech Republic in early March, 15,212 people have been infected.
Nearly 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
There are currently 5,254 patients.
This is according to data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded four times two hundred in a row.
The maximum number of cases was 281 on Friday.
There were 235 positive tests on Thursday, 246 on the day before and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, 169 people were infected.
In the Czech Republic, 9,590 people have been cured of COVID-19, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.
For the most part, the disease had a mild course.
In the hospital, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with coronavirus, 19 of whom are considered serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days, in excess of 100,000 inhabitants, are still showing Karvinsko, which is almost 59.
Following is the Jihlava district with 56 and Fr<0xC3><0xBD>decko-M<0xC3><0xAD>stecko with 36 infected per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people in the Czech Republic, a new measure against the spread of coronavirus has been in place since Saturday.
People must wear underwear at indoor mass events of more than 100 people, it is a cultural and sporting event, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
As of Monday, the capacity of these actions will be reduced from the current thousands of people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have been proven to be infected with the new coronavirus has exceeded the limit of 16 million.
Johns Hopkins University of the United States is monitoring the development of the pandemic globally.
The death toll from COVID-19 is estimated to be close to 645 thousand people.
The latest million people infected came to the statistics in just three days; the limit of 15 million fell on July 22.
The United States, which has recorded more than 4.1 million cases in recent days, has had the largest share of rapid growth in the number of cases, with Brazil accounting for 2.4 million and India accounting for almost 1.4 million people.
The infected are now at a record pace.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday that there have been more than 284,000 new cases worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily rate since the start of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at the top of the list in countries like the US, Brazil or India, according to Reuters, but the number of new cases in the past week has increased in almost 40 countries around the world.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.
The accident has already occurred in almost all countries of the world, the first case officially announced today by the KLDR.
The air in the home is up to five times worse than the outside.
Health harms air fresheners and deodorants
Health threatens not only bad air quality in outdoor spaces, but also at home.
This was pointed out by the Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, who was quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who earned the creation of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is necessary to focus on household pests right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham cited research by the U.S. Environmental Agency (EPA), which found that the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than that of foreign air.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 3.8 million people die prematurely each year from poor air quality in their homes.
“Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced many and still has to work from home, people have to spend more hours at home than before, so it’s time to focus on the air quality in their homes,” Abraham said.
In Israel, according to her, almost no one deals with the quality of the "home air".
At the same time, dangerous things can be things that a person usually comes into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The poison gas also emits clothes that we regularly wear to the cleaners," Abraham said.
According to her, children, elderly members of the household and people with respiratory problems are most at risk.
Even otherwise, the health of individuals may begin to suffer problems such as headache, dizziness, nasal irritability, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
During long-term exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and the central nervous system can be damaged.
Not all pests but come from objects inside the house, the source can also be the material from which the houses are built.
Question about V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada came due to a coronavirus infection in the team with a chance to move to the top Spanish football league.
The management of the competition cancelled the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the men could secure participation in the playoffs.
Fuenlabrada on Saturday reported another 12 infected people, bringing the total number of positive tests for COVID-19 at the club to 28.
Due to the injury in the team, a Monday duel was postponed against La Coruni, in which Fuenlabrada scored a point to get into the playoffs.
The management of the competition said today that the duel against La Coruni definitely withdrew in view of the higher power because it was never played again.
Fuenlabrada made the decision.
La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, on the other hand, storms against the unbeaten match.
In the end, due to the results of their rivals, the victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save, but he considers it unfair that the last round did not play out as usual complete in a single term.
The leadership of a former elite Spanish club is threatened by a fall in the third league by a court.
The first two teams of the Huesca and C<0xC3><0xA1>diz tables have the certainty of the procedure between the elites.
The remaining third place in the playoffs will be Zaragoza, Almer<0xC3><0xAD>a, Girona and Elche.
Karel Gott didn't like V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel?!
Dominic's Daughter Revealed It
"Daddy didn't have to have him for many years," said Gotta Dominic's eldest daughter, with the fact that the Master couldn't come to Havl's name and whenever she spoke to him, Karl said it was always annoying.
It’s hard to say what they did, but according to Dominica, the dispute started sometime in the mid-1990s.
“In an article after the revolution, Dad said he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could have written in a cave in the dark, but if he had resisted somehow, his career would have ended,” says Gott.
In the end, however, he adds that the Czech giants finally found their way to each other.
"I know Havel couldn't hear the word in his sixties at all.
But then the president congratulated him on his birthday and suddenly his father’s relationship with him began to change,” recalls Dominica.
Ten years later, even Gott invited the then-former president to celebrate his 70s at the Ambassador Hotel in Wenceslas Square.
"And there began a new era of their relationship, because Mr. Havla's father called home regularly at Bertram," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavika also said she hated the fact that V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel never received a state award.
However, he only met him in 2009, although it was already in the hands of his successor as V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus (79).
Other honours are given in memoriam, the current President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman (75) is to grant him the Order of the White Lion and thus honor his memory.
Since Tuesday, the Czech Republic’s winds are threatening, meteorologists warn of fires
The warning of meteorologists against high temperatures is valid for Tuesday afternoons for all Czech Republics except the Karlovy Vary region and also for South and Central Moravia.
"Exceptionally, temperatures can exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in the central Czech Republic," they say.
People are advised to adhere to a hot drinking regime and limit the body’s load in the afternoon and afternoon.
Due to the warm weather with the minimum rainfall, there will be a risk of fires starting on Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
The warning of meteorologists against the risk of fires concerns the Central Czech Republic, including Prague, Libereck<0xC3><0xBD>, <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD>, Karlovy Vary and Plze<0xC5><0x88>sk<0xC3><0xBD> region.
The fire warning will be valid until appeal.
"We do not expect more significant collisions that would mitigate the danger in the north-west and west of the Czech Republic at least by the end of the week," the Czech Republic said.
The Prague Magistrate has responded to the warning of meteorologists by banning the distribution of fires at risk sites, which is due to be paid from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be able to set open fires, for example in parks, gardens or forests, up to 50 meters from the edge of the forest.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also prohibited in these places.
The measure will apply to appeal, Prague magistrate V<0xC3><0xAD>t Hofman said.
