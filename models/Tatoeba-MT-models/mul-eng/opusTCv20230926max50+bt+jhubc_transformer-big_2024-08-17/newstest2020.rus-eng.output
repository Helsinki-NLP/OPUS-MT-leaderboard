China strongly opposes U.S. adoption of the "Thailand Bill"
China strongly opposes the U.S. adoption of the so-called "Thailand Bill", which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of the three China-U.S. joint communiqués.
This was announced on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China on Taiwan's affairs Ma Xiaoguan.
The approval by the U.S. Senate Committee on International Relations of this bill is also a serious violation of international law and fundamental principles of international relations and gross interference in China's domestic affairs, Ma Xiaoyuan said.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China, and related issues relate to China’s internal affairs.

China has to be and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by any and no forces, Ma Xiaogwan stressed.
TikTok Hides Uncomfortable Videos from Users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
Imagine China / Reuters
China’s TikTok social network is censoring videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet’s independence, or the banned religious group Falun Gong, The Guardian reports.
The documents, which appeared at the publication, say that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) with the help of the app promotes the goals of China’s foreign policy abroad.
The main part of the violations concerning China’s policy falls under the “inflammation of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok places unpleasant posts in a context that is appropriate under the general rules so that the actions of the social network do not look censored.
For example, the ban on criticism of China’s socialist system falls under the general ban “criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.”
The ban on the mention of incidents in Tiananmen Square or the genocide in Cambodia falls under the “story of China or other countries”.
The document also lists the banned names of twenty "foreign presidents or state officials", including the North Korean documentaries Kim Jong-un, Kim Il-sen, and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, U.S. Presidents Donald Trump, Yajong Trump, and Bar.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by the social network administrators and may result in the user being blocked.
Not too strict violations fall into the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance representatives told The Guardian that these rules were outdated and no longer applied: “We are now using a localized approach to moderation, as well as attracting independent local experts.”
Russian users of TikTok do not have specific restrictions on publication, says co-founder of the “Producer Center” Rustem Bogdanov.
“Producer Center” is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All the advertising materials of the bloggers "Producer Center" agree with the representatives of the social network, but the user materials can be placed without consent, Bogdanov reports.
Asked if TikTok could comment on the policy or Putin, Bogdanov replied affirmatively and said that he had seen such publications.
Bogdanov agrees with the founder of the agency Our Didgital Roman Zaripov: “The basic rules for users of TikTok are listed in the user agreement: it is not possible to post shocking content, discriminative statements and so on.”
But under these rules you can bring down any content that moderators don’t like, notes Zaripov.
Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
Under the user agreement, TikTok can only be used by persons over 13 years of age.
The administrators of the social network check their age with artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes the face and determines how many years a person looks, says Bogdanov.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, its account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork coworking.

The Russians have warned about fake calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudsters has increased, which replace the bank’s phone number.
This is reported by Kommersant with reference to the data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator transmitted information to the operators about more than 2,5 thousand numbers, from which customers of various financial organizations were called.
In 189 cases, the operators discovered the replacement of the number.
A further 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases, restrictions on the use of financial services were imposed.
The deputy head of the information security department of the Central Bank Artem Sychev said that the replacement of the number faced a wide range of Russian banks.
He explained that the operators do not always respond to the Central Bank’s warnings about fraudulent calls, referring to the absence of such a duty in the Law on Communications.
In the bank "Opening", Rosbank and Alfa-bank confirmed the information about the increase in the number of fraudulent calls with the replacement of the number.
As reported in the press service "Bilaina", part of the information about fraudulent calls that the Central Bank transmitted was incorrect: the lists got numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would lead to disruptions in the organization’s work.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of numbers of fraudsters, to which the operator of the communication will contact at each call to check the number.
He explained that it would be necessary to amend the legislation to create such a base.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky discussed Ukraine’s membership in the alliance on the grounds of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
This was reported by Gensek during a speech at Columbia University in New York.

According to him, any country that would like to join the North Atlantic Alliance is required to meet certain conditions to meet specific standards, writes RT.
In the Crimea offered an alternative to the Zelensky course in NATO
President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky, instead of a course to join NATO, should be engaged in establishing good-neighbourly relations with Russia.
On Friday, September 27, the co-chairman of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea, Roman Chegrinets, reported about this.
"Mr. President of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of the predecessor, but should listen to the advice of [US President] Donald Trump, whom he listened to with a sour face, and establish relations with the President of Russia," Chegrinets told reporters at RIA Novosti.
Chegrinets noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian president will be able to remain in power only if relations with the Russian Federation are established.
Earlier on September 27, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that he had held a conversation with Zelensky on the issue of the country's accession to the alliance.

"Barcelona" blackmails Neymar
Spain's Barcelona and its former Brazilian player Neymar are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose after the move of the striker to the French Paris Saint-Germain.
The case almost came to trial, but the Catalans offered the player to settle the dispute without the intervention of Femidia.
Otherwise, they refuse to return.
Neymar and his clever father, who is also an agent of the Brazilian, had an interesting focus: according to an agreement with Barsa, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.
However, literally a year later, the forward was in the PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take away the remaining 18.
Not to mention, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him even interest on the late payment.
When in the capital of Catalonia it became known about the claims of Neymar, "Barcelona" sent a meeting suit.
“Blue grenades” insist that the bonus was relied on for the fulfillment of the entire contract – from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was credited only a quarter of 40 million euros and require the return of a proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer, Neymar and Barsa almost agreed on the return of the "wild" player in the line of Catalonia.
True, the deal was broken, but the hope for the forward's return remains.
And here, according to Sports.Ru, referring to insiders, the club’s lawyers told the players that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in a pre-trial manner, it will exclude the possibility of returning the Brazilian.
Neymar himself wants to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans would buy him back.

The "Moscow case" against the participants of the summer protest actions further, the more noticeable it breaks down into individual fragments and loses political fill.
Evidence of the very fact of "mass disorder" does not stand the test, but in the absence of a political decision to put this case on hold, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of charges.

On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining defendants in the case under Article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass disorder) - Alexei Minaylo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligation, and a few hours later he was released from prison.
Minajlo had been under arrest for almost two months, followed by several professional communities: historians, priests, writers.
After that, only two accused remained in the case in the participation in the mass riots (the original accused was 13): Sergey Fomin, transferred on 3 September under house arrest, and Samariddin Rajabov, to whom the court extended the arrest until the end of December.

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
One of the most famous is pine pollen.
Phytoestrogens are well studied and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain age-related diseases (among them cardiovascular, some types of cancer).
Known sources of phytoestrogens - all beans (the most popular - soya), hops, flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such BADs cannot be a complete replacement for natural hormones.
It is not possible to exclude the possible harm from such supplements.
For example, against the background of their intake, the production of their own hormones can be reduced due to the fact that too many analogues come into the body from the outside.

The Hydrometeorological Center has named the true folk signs
In Russia, there are many folk traditions that people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometer Center has checked all the signs that allegedly work.
Meteorologists have come to the conclusion that only two of them can really be trusted, however, in the short-term time frame.
As the head of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center Roman Wilfand said, if the sun is red during the event, then the next day will be really nice, as our ancestors pointed out.
If the sky is clear, it will rain the next day.
The second working note is based on bird-watching.
It’s more often said about butterflies, if they fly low, then it’s usually rain.
This is explained simply - when the humidity of the air is high, mosquitoes suck wings and feathers are forced to lower to hunt insects, writes TASS.
On different continents there are folk signs.

Unrecognised oil stains have been found on the beaches of northeastern Brazil
Oil stains of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
Estimates of pollution have been scattered over two thousand kilometers of the coastline.
Reports of the first oil stains discovered began to be received on the second of September.
However, with each day up to Thursday, their number, as well as territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Institute of the Environment conducted a chemical analysis of the detected samples.
It turned out that all of them are identical and it is about crude oil.
The state oil corporation Petrobras, which was transferred to the analysis of the samples found, said that according to its composition they do not correspond to the oil extracted from the fields in the territory of Brazil.
"It's a thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And it is most likely to have come into the ocean current,” — told the Brazilian news portal G1 the coordinator of the union of workers of the oil industry of the states of Pernambuco and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to dispose of waste in the open sea.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the north-east of the country, environmentalists found nine sea turtles, completely covered with oil film.
Only two of them survived.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environmental Institute, together with the company Petrobras, will begin cleaning contaminated beaches.
And so far, the experts of the institute recommend tourists and locals to bypass the oil stains and warn about all the detected points of pollution.

The Russians have nothing to put off for retirement - V. Matvienko
The speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko believes that the Russians do not have enough funds in order to fully earn a bill on a guaranteed pension product in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions due to personal accumulations in the world is quite common.
It’s another matter of how timely it is for us to introduce it.
“In my opinion, a significant part of the population now has incomes, from which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pension security in the future,” Matvienko said.
According to the speaker, the Russians cannot understand the mechanisms of formation and the calculation of pensions, as “permanent changes in this area have finally confused them.”
That does not mean that I am against the improvement of the pension system that regulates its legislation.
“Russia is a social state, and we have a duty to do everything we can to improve pensions, improve the social protection of citizens.
But the steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account domestic realities," Matvienko told RIA Novosti.
The head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the bill on a guaranteed pension product) is to be developed, several basic principles must necessarily be provided, including volunteerism, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and accountability for the state.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced the sending of a draft law on a guaranteed pension product (GPP).
Among its main elements are the exclusively voluntary procedure of citizens joining the system of accumulations, ensuring the preservation of long-term pension accumulations of citizens by the state, registration of savings accounts of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.

One of the most famous comic book characters - Spider-Man - will remain in the movie-like Marvel.
Disney and Sony Pictures have agreed on the rights to use it in the film franchise.
This has become known from Sony’s press release, which says that the third part of Spider-Man with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
Earlier it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not come to a consensus on revenue sharing, which is why Spider-Man will leave the movie-themed Marvel.
The rights to the movie are owned by Sony.
She rented them for Marvel films, which is owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony received revenue from movie theaters, and Disney from souvenirs and toys.
As it was reported, at some point such a situation ceased to govern Disney, and the company wanted to revise the agreement.
Marvel Studios President Kevin Faygie said he was delighted.
Surprisingly, the Spider-Man’s journey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue.
“We are all very happy at Marvel Studios that we will be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a significant figure.
This is a hero whose story touches all generations and audiences around the world," he said in a statement.
At the same time, Faigi recalled that Sony is also creating its own movie theater, built just around Spider-Man.
“So it happened that he was the only super-forced hero to have been in different movie theaters.
So as long as Sony continues to develop its own Spider-Man universe, the future can bring unexpected surprises,” he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently, commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram account a excerpt from the film "Wolf from Wall Street" in which the hero Leonardo di Caprio shouts "I'm not cool!"
Information about the contradictions between the companies appeared in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to receive half of the cash proceeds from Spider-Man films provided that both companies would pay half of the cost of producing the paintings.
But that didn’t work out for Sony.
The news of the possible departure of a beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has sparked anger among many devoted fans.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been announced.
According to CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the deal, but said: “We’ve worked well together for the past four years, and our shared desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many [ Spider-Man] fans.
We’re happy to be able to move forward together.”
The film Avengers: Finale, which brought Spider-Man, Thor, Halka and other Marvel superheroes together, became the most box-office film in the history of the world, putting Avatar in first place.

The expert explained why it is worth giving up tea in packets
A team of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found that when brewing a pack of tea in a cup in five minutes, more than ten billion microplastic particles fall into it.
The packaged drink can also be added to the ashes, said Nation News food safety expert Elizaveta Tikhonov.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer can add there ingredients that will not be indicated on the package.
The bulbs at the end of the season are not thrown away, so they can be in the tea.
“Moreover, the packages do not always include tea plants,” Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to refuse to use such a drink in favor of tea for weight, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaged tea is not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - microparticles heat up to high temperatures, which is why they can begin to secrete harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - in such a drink there will be less additives," - said the expert.

It is time to establish interregional ties
The Economic Policy Committee of the Council of the Federation summarized the information received from the regions on the current programmes for the development of business and the legalization of self-employed persons, as well as on the results of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions told senators about the problems of ISP development and made proposals to improve the current legislation.
“To date, communication between regions is not sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the visit by senators has been identified as the lack of information about regional programs of development of entrepreneurship in the country as a whole,” said Andrei Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a summary of the positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and aggregated data from the regions with proposals and issues (available to the Editorial Board).
In addition to the profile ministries, aggregate data from the regions is also sent to the heads of the regional executive bodies.

Self-employed continue to emerge from the shadow
According to the regional authorities, a number of changes to the current legislation should be made to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region has proposed replacing the term “self-employment” with “entrepreneurship” because it is “most appropriate to the content of the public service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to amend the list of activities carried out by self-employed citizens, including the types of activities for the decoration and repair of residential premises, house buildings, physical training classes.

And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions, the concept of “social entrepreneurship” and the directions of support of social entrepreneurship are being strengthened in the normative and legal field.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills," - assured Andrei Kutepov.

The supply of “sanctions” to Russia fell 100 times
The Russian government estimated that the supply of agricultural products and food to Russia from countries that fell under the Russian food embargo has decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to the President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin, in the first half of 2019, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from the sanctions countries versus 3 million 442.2 thousand tons for the same period of 2013, reports Interfax.
At the same time, the value of imported products decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion to 975.5 million, respectively.
We are talking about deliveries of goods that did not fall under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the lapsed volumes of the prohibited products were compensated by the increase in imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
Recall that at the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from importing into Russia as part of counter-sanctions.
The document, posted on the official legal information portal, noted that the rules have been extended for another one per year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the effect of the decree on the destruction of the sanction was extended to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, since August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein have "attached" to this list, since January 1, 2016 - Ukraine.
The decree signed by Putin on the destruction of illegally imported “sanctions” (products that fell under the food embargo, which Moscow introduced in response to anti-Russian sanctions of the West) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the government has allowed the destruction of “sanctional” food in any lawful way.
As Western sanctions are maintained, the Russian Federation has also extended its response measures.
At the same time, on products that citizens import for personal use, this measure does not apply.
The ban does not apply to imports of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation for the development of civil society and human rights Mikhail Fedotov previously called it “just immoral” destruction of food products, and this, he said, negatively affects the education of people.
Moreover, with the initiative to ban the destruction of food products suitable for use, Rospotrebnadzor spoke in early June.
After that, a similar recommendation was made to the government by the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.
And Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Alexey Gordeev said that destroying food products is wrong, and you need to think about how to use them on purpose, evaluating the quality.

In Chile began to build a telescope worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 billion
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, this week officially began the construction of a dome of the building, where the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) will be located, the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project so far.
Its total value, according to ESO, will exceed one billion euros.
Much of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-sized mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be collected from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two supporting reflecting surfaces in diameters of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT get the first detailed photos of planets outside the Solar System, stars in other galaxies, as well as search for Earth's doppelgangers.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory for observations around Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome is only started, mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory, scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, the total cost of which was about 400 million euros, was received by the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
