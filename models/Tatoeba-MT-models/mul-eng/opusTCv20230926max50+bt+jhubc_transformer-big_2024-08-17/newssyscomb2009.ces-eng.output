Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, combined with 29%
The significant weakening of the two sides of the so far large coalition and the significant strengthening of right-wing populist parties have led to the first preliminary results of Sunday's early parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP) suffered a particularly severe loss, which severely upsets the position of the current President Wilhelm Molter.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the Croatian hetman J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider is about to triumphantly return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, it remains the strongest party in the country Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8 percent of the vote, but loses 5.5 percent of the vote against the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the <0xC3><0x96>VP lost by 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote.
These are the worst results of both of these major parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially among the people who called early elections, a literally catastrophic result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP emerged from the coalition, the people had a considerable jump in their preferences before SP<0xC3><0x96>.
The voters, however, apparently punished them for letting the government go bankrupt.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party's chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molter.
Observers are of the opinion that this could happen as early as Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the party's presidency.
Such a development would apparently facilitate the path to the increasingly likely outcome of the election, i.e. to the restoration of the large coalition of SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Due to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Free (FP<0xC3><0x96>) won 18 percent and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> eleven percent of the vote in advance - but the social democrats at the same time expressed concerns about the resumption of 1999 when the people of Europe agreed with the populists (then it was only in 2005)
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and expects to return to Vienna for a full-fledged policy.
The Green Party, which lost easily and collapsed between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place, was still in parliament.
None of the other parties apparently crossed the four-percent border and did not get into parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If the problem could not be solved with Czech scientists who were accused in India of illegally collecting strawberries, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it didn't work out, then yes, then there would be some cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the hearing that the executive branch can be difficult to intervene in court matters.
However, he said that in the case of Peter Swachy, who was acquitted and punished by the fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government in D<0xC3><0xA1>rjiling, whose jurisdiction the matter falls under.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>er sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherjee said it would be best to appeal to a higher court.
He can then ask to be released on bail and wait for the verdict to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the negotiations.
"He recommends appeal to the higher court, then it would be possible to favor him," the Czech diplomat said.
The only way the Czech party can get into the whole matter is to provide "competent legal support" to the convicted, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance is already being provided by the Indian side.
"We are keen to maintain the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, he stressed in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider the deep mistake of arresting and prosecuting these Czech scientists," he said.
The answer to the question of whether he received a pledge from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister avoided.
"I've made quite a few promises," he said.
Czech Judges Fight for the Seabed
It will come up with a wall-mounted electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and, along with it, the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-member team of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and Maritime Law.
His boss, director of the division, Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, monitors the interpretation and occasionally adds it.
There's a working elan and a passion.
The seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Oil, ores and other non-growing raw materials can be found here, but also unknown living organisms, which carry the key to the development of the cure for cancer.
The bottom is larger than the solid
Today, coastal states have begun to vehemently pursue new subsea territories.
According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
According to the Convention, it has the exclusive right to all resources of the continental shelf.
"Simplifiedly, behind the continental shelf is this part of the seabed and its base, which is a natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the coastal sea, often beyond the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the definition of the outer borders of the continental shelf must be evidenced by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
“One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far dealt with five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only three of these countries have succeeded," Mikulka adds.
The World Report recently noted the success of Australia, which was the first to substantially expand its submarine states.
But New Zealand has also won – the stretch of the seabed, which the commission admitted to him last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profit that will accrue to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other States will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do so for up to ten years from the time they ratified the "Convention of Montego Bay".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, a convention declared a "common heritage of mankind".
No state has an exclusive status here anymore.
The mining right in this area shall be granted by the Convention established by an international institution.
"The bottom of the sea is not a Klondike," Mikulka said, adding that his "individual areas are properly defined and their regime is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are being discussed with other countries of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it was granted the status of a so-called pioneer investor under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other countries.
It is authorised to exploit the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, lying between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is glued there, it is a kind of subsea replica of the Tater.
“It can be used on an area of a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer Ind Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian worker of the division Rober Sandev brings to the demonstration one such concrete.
It resembles a small potato or, in a bit of fantasy, a wonderful schema that, according to legend, revived Golem.
The German Special Operations Units were liberated from the hostages.
The Egyptian government has asked for help from Germany in solving the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation deteriorated, the special units were ready, but there was no deployment.
The public is gradually receiving further details of the circumstances surrounding the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue.
According to the statement of the ministries, both experts of the Federal Army and members of the anti-terrorist group of the German police GSG9, the Federal Police Wings, the Federal Criminal Office and also experts on logistics from the Service of the HilfTechnik (Technical Assistance).
However, according to a statement from the two ministers on Monday afternoon, there was no need for German forces because the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government said the aid offered by Germany was accepted as a support force for the on-the-spot action.
"Fortunately, it didn't happen," said one of the Federal Ministry of the Interior's spokesman.
The attackers took a group of five German, five Italian, one Romanian and eight of their Egyptian guides to the south of Egypt on September 19.
After the abduction in the desert region of southern Egypt, hostages were moved to the border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
At present, the rescues are already in order in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said the release of the hostages was under the care of the German embassy.
The details of the release were not disclosed.
There is currently no information available in Berlin on when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the letter "Bild", all five tourists should also fly with special forces one of the Airbuses of the German air force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the bailout package.
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress allowed the $700 billion bailout package to fall by the wayside.
The Dow Jones index fell sharply.
In a ratio of 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected a government bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the challenges of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both sides, the majority did not find a program to alleviate the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic move, supporters have desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called before the vote of the MP for a consensus, although, as he put it, the plan is not popular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the voting, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
Investors were concerned that the government's bailout package might collapse.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose to fall sharply again after the notice of loss of the package.
Experts are now counting on other serious turbulences in the international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, the consent of the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Travel agents are recording an increasing number of bookings
It seems that winter will be good for German entrepreneurs in the tourist traffic:
According to one study, travel bookings for the next month increased significantly compared to the previous year – in the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic growth, the desire of the Germans to travel remains unshakeable.
When booking for the winter season, travel agencies saw a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reisverband, DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin.
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, there are already an increased number of reservations available for the autumn months.
Thus, according to the DRV’s statement in October, the turnover was about 11 percent higher compared to 2007.
The basis for these results is the GfK numbers, which evaluates the booking data from 1200 German travel agencies each month and interpolates them to the overall market.
This result included bookings for trips that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak exchange rate of the dollar, travel to the United States is mainly requested, the DRV said.
With these routes, the booking increase is about one-third.
In addition, in Germany, the objectives of Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic water, are particularly sought after.
Above all, organized tours are on course, said the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
Given the rising energy and food costs, the costs here are "slowly affordable for the client than for individually organized vacations".
Laepple explained that money can be saved by consumers, among other things, by using a discount for a timely reservation or an all-inclusive offer.
Even in the summer months, the number of bookings was very good, so a higher turnover will again be recorded compared to the previous year – although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip has declined compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
An endlessly repeated ashtray, beer from tupl<0xC3><0xA1>k and prominent in the circles from well-known designers.
For the first time in beer.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She's a blonde, a TV presenter, and she's wearing a tailor's crown.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: we’re not even three minutes on a beer plate, and we’re already being thrown in by photographers and they’re filling up with memory cards – that’s what makes me tick, because I’m at the Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can be friends.
It seems that my cheap circuit has fulfilled its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage plain, and so my sense of comfort in the county was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a woman’s crown or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassedly touched – everything is completely normal.
A special look at the stand with bananas in chocolate picks up only my veil.
One of the monks reminds me that I tied her up badly: "To the left you are free, in the middle of the womb, to the right, to the back of the womb."
Secrets I'm going to move, they're going from left to right.
"All right," he said, laughing.
Others with subtle flirting techniques don’t care so much and wear simple braided hats with the inscription “To drink to get dressed!” and exhale on the next naked ass.
The young man with such exhibitionistic tendencies is named Bob, he is from England and came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He thinks it's "gorgeous", with an extended "owl".
That's what he's telling me after he's been sniffing around on his just-sniffed stomach.
Right next to one of those hydrants everyone thinks they're garbage cans.
Bob is, therefore, one of the feared "Wildbieslers", as is commonly called in Bavaria in public by people who are free to pee.
Others are lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening they run around the square where the Oktoberfest takes place, horrendously health professionals who have to take care of the poor drinkers.
Doctors always appear in the hens - in the four carries a covered carrier from the tent to the tent.
They function like most beer beers visitors: empty there, full back again.
Whoever lies under the cloak of this coffin of mercy, is not seen.
"It's the salt that can't go on," one of the doctors calls me in response to my question and disappears in the crowd.
Police have released the name of the victim of the accident
The name of a 36-year-old woman who died in hospital after being hit by a car in Essex was released.
The accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon hit Carole Paulson off Chelmsford Road.
She was transferred to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, an 11-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He's already been released to police custody.
Turkish diplomatic horizons are expanding.
Long before Turkey began to seek entry into the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish border.
On the east coast of Bosphorus, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this unsuccessful imperial ambition.
The Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Con in a non-renaissance style.
This is what the tourist guide will tell you.
The building sits round at the end of the staircase with a tower on each corner of the front, looking unobtrusively from a provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once a person gets into the vaulted vaults, he can no longer doubt the size of the enterprise, the westernmost gate of which was the station.
In August 1908, the station was opened by the German consortium of the Anatolian-Baghdadi Corporation.
Germany, which was involved in the late game of empires, intended to realize its ambition to take control of the Middle East by means of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad and further on to the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But German imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their gangs were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
The relative isolation from the surrounding areas, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial troops marched from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And bad news has also come for the station Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a.
In 1917, the explosion of the ammunition train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was a matter of sabotage.
Since then, they have been gradually collapsing and history has been surrounding them.
Today, however, this gateway to Anatolia and further east is used – at least symbolically – to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding territories, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
A new policy is now in place - Turkey is committed.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I set off on a night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I had to meet one of the leading experts of the AKP on foreign policy, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a screeching ride on the tracks that reminded me of the ancient world rhythms of the well-known document The Night Post, I arrived in the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for the secular state, which was about to pass to its Ottoman minaret.
However, the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a shift in the paradigm of the Turkish consensus.
In the West, she raised suspicion, especially in Washington.
The taxi brought me to the main state of AKP, an ultramodern stone and metal building, purposefully built on a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-detached commercial houses and power dealers, where the middle managers in the business shops - men and women - shopped as well.
Suat Kiniklioglu could quietly be a centre-right politician from almost every other European political party.
Saco, tie, I'm sure he had Blackberry, too.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate vicinity.
“The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its borders.
Today we have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
He had to do both.
"But surely there will come a time," I asked, "when may Turkey have to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not wish for such a decision to take place."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to was almost remembering: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea region are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, travel along these tracks to East Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1> station, after the next mostly waking night, I thought of the two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Con, who were watching how this building was built a hundred years ago.
How would they be surprised if they found that European ambitions in the Middle East could now be, to a large extent, in Turkish hands.
And as I waited in the port for the ferry back over Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt that the continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologist, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and choir.
As part of the district musical plan, he founded a year for it an excellent group of young Proteus.
He was supposed to be 21 years old, but by the time Proteus sang the last time in 1979, a few of us were almost 30 – we just refused to give up the band.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shapeshifter) represented the choir's willingness and ability to indulge in any music that was presented to it - whether it was madrigals or Messiaen, either independently or with an entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often stunning, always exciting, and all thanks to the inspiration of the one man and the enthusiasm for the music that remained completely unchanged throughout.
How often did only Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in that music.
Then sing it! "
His tactile technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor Mayan.
No matter where the music standard was, he always picked it up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If there was to be a conductor strapped to a knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in two decades when he was conducting the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed with any of them – and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "tightened the world with one or two punched sacks".
Many of us will be missing.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary William Woodruff (25 September) claims that "in 1946 he returned to economic history in Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... and at the same time studied at BSc, MA and PhD."
This is based on Woodruff's comment in Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time he did a dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as a publication of the British rubber industry.
He spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resina's exhibition Flamenco and Life, because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was seduced by the simplicity and the strong charge with which he acted on the audience, and by the attention and respect of the photographers.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotion.
Resino is able to capture magical moments.”
Honda will attack its bestseller for the second time
In November, Honda will start selling the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the predecessor of this one-storied vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
To this end, improved engines are added, which increase the comfort of driving and allow for greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view, the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes on this single-seater car.
It is necessary to mention, for example, innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes on the market six years after the introduction of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing to note is the fact that Honda needed to rejuvenate this model for a shorter period of time than other manufacturers.
Although Jazz is a less well-known model in Europe, it has become a phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
In Japan, almost a million pieces have been sold since the launch of Honda Jazz.
The second market became an old continent with about half a million pieces sold in six years.
Honda, however, aims to increase sales of the new Jazz in its category.
That is, while in 2007 this Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 pieces of Honda Jazz, in 2009 an estimated 100,000 cars are expected, which would mean a 17% increase in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 pieces of the Jazz model since 2002, which means 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
When it comes to the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 pieces throughout the year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly mitigate the decline in sales in Spain.
The management of the carmaker thus de facto expects the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007 and a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its share in the Spanish market to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% from last year.
In 2010, this Japanese company expects it to reach 2%.
In order for Honda to achieve this, it relies on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-door hybrid of compact size with a length of 4.37 meters, from which the Japanese company promises to sell approximately 200,000 units per year worldwide.
In terms of markets, according to the Japanese manufacturer estimates, 50 % of Insight is sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will split between the old continent and Japan.
Honda Insight is expected to launch in the first months of next year, as soon as it will be presented to the public in January in Valencia.
In contrast to the first generation, all the dimensions of the new Jazz increased.
Its length has increased to 3.9 meters (by five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (by two centimeters more), and clearance to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
There has also been an increase in the size of the interior.
However, this advantage was achieved by using a new platform, but by storing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
Also, the volume of luggage space – which has a double bottom system – increased to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the volume of luggage space in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions occur in the version with the 1.4 engine, since the volume of the luggage space at Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Another improvement, apart from external elements - such as rear LED lights or the option of glazed panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow an opening angle of 80 degrees versus 67 for the first Jazz model.
In the second generation of Honda Jazz, there are new engines.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines of 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions, and brings excellent performance improvements to the drive system at the same time with a high torque in the full range of engine speeds.
The first 1.2-litre engine has 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine – which had the previous generation of the Jazz 78 horse – consumes 5.3 liters and emits 125 grams of CO2.
In contrast to the previous engine, which reached 83 horsepower in the previous generation, it will now reach 100 horsepower.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with 100 horsepower has a combined fuel consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"Car Bee" Prevents Crashes
This time, Nissan was inspired by nature, specifically by bees, to advance the development of technologies to protect against accidents.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the bee flying pattern and thus prevents collisions.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which is the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Center for Technical Progress Nissan Motor Co. Robot have developed in collaboration with the Center for Advancement in Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhira Doie, General Director of Public Relations for Technology, Research and Brand Development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four safety shield zones.
The task of the robot is to strengthen the ability to prevent collisions in vehicles of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
However, the most important are complex bees of the eye, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, allowing the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
When creating this visual feature, the engineers proposed what they called the Laser Range Finder (Laser Range Finder).
It records obstacles up to a distance of two meters in a 180 degree circle before BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns it into a collision warning.
"The moment an obstacle is recorded, the robot mimics the bee's movement and immediately changes direction by turning the wheel to a right or even greater angle to prevent a collision.
The biggest difference compared to any existing system is the fact that all moving maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move upwards and downwards or diagonally, its movement is limited only to two dimensions and to the direction in which it is allowed to rotate its wheel, but not in an infinite number of directions and options as with bees.
In addition to speeding up and slowing down, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent a collision.
"The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and behave according to this data.
It does not require the retention of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with just two dozen kB of memory.
You may be surprised, but we’re not talking about gigs or megas.”
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology where Nissan predicts the use of serial cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit into the GPS system of satellite navigation, which would lead the driver to the destination and avoid obstacles on the way.
Enjoy the fear before you take a mortgage
It should be acknowledged that the U.S. Department of Finance, in addition to having enough capital to distribute injections, does not lack ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from taking risky mortgages at banks with questionable solvency, created a popular-science game "Bad Credit Hotel" online.
Not "The Hotel of Bad Credits"... or a complicated hotel.
The hotel, and especially its reception, look cloudy so that one can think once, twice, and three times about whether it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, even if not too detailed.
This site is more suitable for young people than space for the whole public.
What happens when the game ends?
Inside the hotel there will be a dream room.
At least something, because I'd rather not talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley Opens MUFG Capital
Morgan Stanley has announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s largest bank, will spend nine billion dollars to raise 21% of its capital. The adoption of this report led to a significant decline in its stock market price.
A week after they revealed their preliminary deal, the two banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s common stock at a flat price of $25.25, representing a total payout of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19 % lower than the carrying amount of securities as at 31 August.
MUFG is investing an additional $6 billion to acquire convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and whose exchange rate is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley clarified that the entire operation will be carried out on the basis of the average unit price of $29, i.e. 28% below its current rate.
Morgan Stanley’s shares lost 6.79 percent and rose to $23.07 at around 17.00 Greenwich time.
“This strategic merger represents an important opportunity on the way to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to a banking holding status,” said John Mack, CEO of the group.
The new statute was adopted by Morgan Stanley last week, allowing him to diversify his activities, but at the same time it is placed under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with the MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest axis to take a far more cautious approach than before.
The terms presented on Monday show, among other things, that the deal has changed over the past few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that he was selling up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
“We thought a week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, the MUFG’s executive director, told reporters in Tokyo, “that our participation will consist solely of common actions.
However, given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and also cover up.”
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay 7% less for Morgan Stanley securities than their carrying amount.
And the operation will result in a 20% reduction in the profit from the share.
The agreement foresees that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares in a year if they are last named for a certain period of time at a price of 50 % exceeding the exchange rate, i.e. at approximately $ 47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital brought by MUFG will enable him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his cash.
However, the group refused to provide detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should boast about 15% of Tier One’s ability to pay, which is one of the best in the industry.
Morgan pointed out that since the end of August, he has "citly" reduced his balance.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, as its stock exchange rate has fallen by half, while the insurance costs against the risk of non-payment associated with debt have sharply increased.
On Monday, these costs took the opposite course, but remained high, at around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced that it had chosen $15 billion, in part from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
Re-establishing a republic around 21st century socialism.
Such is the joint project of Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez, Bolivia’s Eva Morales and Ecuador’s Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third nominee put to the vote, on the model of his counterparts and friends, the proposal of the new Constitution.
And his mission is fulfilled, as 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the vote, voted "yes" in the referendum.
According to these results, "No" obtained 28 %, 7 % of the votes were invalid and 0,7 % of the ballots were empty.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two surveys carried out at the exit from polling stations and the non-governmental organization’s estimates predicted a clear “yes” victory on Sunday, ranging from 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa called for the victory of his proposed constitution on Monday night.
"The Constitution has won on the whole line," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at the seat of the Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quit.
It is clear to herself that Rafael Correa received a blessing from Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), took place peacefully, concerned the text of 444 points building "new socialism" promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy by providing it with the "planning of development" of a country living primarily from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and from the currency sent by its emigrants.
The Correou-protected proposal, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, who will be able to carry out two consecutive four-year mandates and be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that it will exercise this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
Among other things, the constitution establishes the principle of free health and education, which the president began to introduce in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also counts on banning the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Washington and Quit on the use of the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
19 hostages were released in Chad.
The Egyptian commando attacked the kidnapping of eleven tourists and their eight-member escort, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were detained for ten days in the desert, were taken alive and well to the Egyptian capital on Monday.
In the morning, an Egyptian command was liberated in Chad.
The hostages arrived around 3.30 p.m., apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft at al-Maza military base, close to Cairo’s international airport.
They were immediately transported without the opportunity to express themselves in the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, the outskirts of the residential district of Cairo, to be subjected to medical examinations there.
“They are completely healthy” and “no ransoms have been paid to the passengers,” Egypt’s tourism minister Zohejr Garrana said on the airport’s runway.
Since its capture on 19 September during a four-wheel-drive safari in a vehicle at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages has been dragged from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard director of the Aegyptous agency, safari organizers.
A senior Egyptian security official indicated that 30 members of the special forces, who approached the scene on board two helicopters, had set off on a run during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shooting, half of the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said the source, who wanted to remain anonymous.
He pointed out that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the lightning unit were sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is located, mentioned the role played by the secret agents and components of the Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and effectiveness of people from our secret services, from special forces," he said, without further clarification.
He also denied that the ransom would be paid.
On the eve of the day, the Sudanese army said it had detained the vehicle with the four-wheel drive on which the hijackers were on board, six of them including the Chadian commander and two of them arrested.
The army claimed to have been linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement - Unit (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
Letters - The Silent Majority of the Cultural Resort
The debate on the financing of culture fills the pages of the newspaper with thumbprints and is the subject of an ongoing pre-election campaign.
I'll be fine.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise up to loot the poor sums that are provided by small museums, archives, archaeological digs, and national memorials that will starve?
Which politician would like to remind the federal government that they will forget their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don’t have laws that would actually protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors it is written in the Constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organizations, in cooperation.
In Quebec, in the Quebec History Society Federation, at least 40,000 volunteers join 211 history, monuments, archives, and genealogy societies to cover history, preserve a collection of private archives, and protect archaeological remains for a few minutes.
Often, these societies are the watchdogs of our monuments, who are driven by hopelessness protest when promoters and leading figures throw their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When do we finally meet the tribunes for history and monuments?
Benelux’s government is a state-owned part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which is the first in Europe to get into trouble due to the widening effect of the U.S. mortgage market crisis, partly by nationalization: three countries will support the monetary and insurance institution, which has a capital of 11.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed to this at the highest level with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Economic Competition.
Fortis is the first bank in the euro area to be hit by a major crisis in the context of the crisis of international financial markets, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year, and the decision taken in this regard could be seen as a precedent.
In the sense of the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy out almost half (49 percent) of the bank’s assets there.
The bank is definitely selling some of its equity stakes, especially then - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
The shares of Fortis Bank began to decline sharply last week, and in the second half of the week serious signs of the crisis appeared in the institution.
Analysts agree, however, that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it fail.
The company’s securities fell 12 percent on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the stock value has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Due to the current stock prices, the total market capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but this is unrealistic, according to the company’s executives.
The company’s management is blamed for the fall in the shares of Fortis’s uncertainty in the overseas market related to the adoption of the $700 billion plan of the US package.
The stock rose slightly on Monday.
On Friday, a new general manager, Filip Dierckx, was appointed as head of the bank.
The Monetary Institute was also looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has signed up yet.
The Belgian government has previously announced that investors do not have to worry, they will not come for their money.
There has been no panic among the bank’s clients and the branches have not been the gateway to the attack.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate branch and has also acquired several leasing companies.
Liska in a chicken
Life and health insurance companies in the United States, based on people’s data on the purchase of medicines, often reject the option to conclude an insurance contract with the applicant.
Data protection experts are concerned that the data market will become unchecked.
“There is a data protection program that binds the use of data on prescription drugs in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
It must be in the hands of someone who is independent, otherwise we entrust a spoonful of leeks," quotes the Washington Post's Richard Dick, author of a program designed to monitor drug prescriptions.
Insurance companies make insurance and the amounts paid in the case of insurance events depending on the health status of the interested parties, and if the risk is assessed as too high, they will not even close the insurance with it.
Previously, they sent the relevant medical examinations and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number of the customer from the pharmacy, he can easily find out which drugs he bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself explains what the disease is, and what its health status is.
For example, if you regularly buy a large amount of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it suggests that it has virtually uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which immediately puts it in the category of higher risk.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of which determine the risk factor at the same time, so there is almost no work left for insurance companies except for paperwork, although minor problems arise.
Disadvantages include that medical drugs can also be used for several purposes, some compounds, for example, can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but are also effective against depression.
These represent, from the point of view of commercial insurers, a significant factor increasing the risk, whereas the abovementioned difficulties are not.
In order to request and process the data, special companies have been created, which before they would have received the necessary information from the pharmacist, ask the patient for permission.
They are now being forced by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their negligence so far.
Some companies are already processing the results of laboratory tests, which are associated with data on the drugs used, so that they can provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, while at the same time controlling their use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness only applies to providers of health services and insurance companies.
The bill, which gives the authorities the power to control companies specializing in the provision of data, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: therefore, his program has developed such that the transmission of data is linked to the explicit consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is that the permit in question can hardly be denied, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with it.
So, after all, the chicks are just a little bit tied to the leaves of good will.
The Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India will double trade turnover
As the European Union and India are each other’s leading trading partners, this theme has led, in addition to other, mostly global issues, to the agenda of the ninth meeting at the highest level.
A French-Indian summit will also be held today, which will focus primarily on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is a developing democratic power, which should be given a greater opportunity to speak on international issues, but the Member States have not yet succeeded in finding a common denominator in the question of supporting the permanent membership of the UN in the New Deal.
This question has not been further discussed at yesterday's, already ninth summit, held in Marseilles.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, and European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, respectively, and Javier Solana, the High Representative for Foreign Policy, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed to double the trade to five billion or more years.
Since between 2000 and 2007, the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious goal.
In this sense, from a legal point of view, twenty-six existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation were harmonized, so that the green also got into the future air transport.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised that negotiations would be expedited.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi ranks among the EU’s partners in ninth place.
The summit also focused attention on global issues as well.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism, respectively, were condemned by both parties in all its forms and called for the accelerated convening of the UN conference.
They also urged the end of the round of business negotiations with the Dawah, although both have a large share in his failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will continue on its energy and climate programme, as it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India has also agreed to this, as well as the need to conclude a global agreement at the climate conference next year and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 per cent by 2050.
Both sides would also like to prevent food prices from rising and support the convening of an international conference to deal with the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is on his way to the French capital today, where he intends to close a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that the mandate to build Indian nuclear reactors worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion will be acquired by French companies.
According to the agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
A large participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will take part in the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expected to host more than 7000 exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries, who will take 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as host.
The Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inauguration ceremony in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a press conference at Room Structure Buchmesse in pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present the numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors in relation to the overall Italian production is still decreasing, mainly due to the literature for children and adults.
Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The rest of the plane was found by Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying across the desert in Nevada.
The debris was discovered on a single plateau at an altitude of three thousand meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Nevada, on the California-Nevada border.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
"The plane was found, we sent a team there, and now we're sure it's exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he told a news conference.
The sheriff said no human remains had been found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
A 63-year-old millionaire has been dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) announced that a team of investigators had been sent to identify the plane several hours after the debris was detected: it was precisely the Bellanc 8kcab, unknown since September 3, 2007, when Fossett landed from Yering.
Yesterday, still in California, near the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal belongings were found by a couple near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents with Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and one suit.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire has gained a place in history thanks to a long collection of championships.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a trip around the world in an air balloon: a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, he flew the world on a plane without landing.
His many records also include a flight at an altitude of 15,445 meters, above Andami, although with a copilot.
Look at the advertising you don’t expect.
One unusual Suv with an original design and precisely defined decision lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the "compact" Jeeps of the Star House, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to bring the faith of the novelty to this sector.
It is thanks to its non-traditional processing that there will be unexpected and unconventional communication, which will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk and will be available in the showrooms of Mercedes-Benz from October 17th.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which will accompany the debut of the new vehicle, will also start the unofficial way of communication thanks to the futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is thus used for the first time in Italy for the automotive brand.
The maxi poster project, divided into three different phases, will be dominated by Milan’s main business class, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication begins with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and with the help of special glasses, which will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different moments in all its little ones, then reassembled into a single image.
Mercedes is no doubt trying to bring something new to the stereotypical area of automotive communication with this ad.
Will he be able to stimulate the interest of future customers in this way?
So we already know who the Italian Chuligans are.
From Trivenet, they risk Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been watching the Nazionale azzurra for years and which, to be honest, has never made excessive problems.
She's never even met her opponent's fans.
The group's orientation is right-wing.
The founders are from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padovy, Terstu and Udine.
In Sofia, they were joined by groups (in fact, few groups) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-coloured flags, on which the cities of origin of the participants appear: on Saturday evening they were removed so that they were not recognized.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they found real Nazi fans, Levski.
Figc has made 144 tickets available to Italian fans for the match: all in name, i.e. easily controllable.
And Viminale really checked them all out: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the running Dasl, no one who would be banned from visiting the stadiums.
The four blue fans, who had previous violations from the stadium, were denied a ticket and the match was banned.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports coming from the Bulgarian police, then take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo at least five years to fans who have been arrested or those who have been identified during the outbreak.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also throughout Europe.
Our chuligans, in short, will no longer step into a single stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is a fear of emulation: this means that more than one hundred and fifty are added to the others.
“We must immediately put out this fire and not justify those who behave in this way,” Viminalu said.
So, "well-opened eyes, mainly because of the national game on Wednesday in Le<0xC4><0x8D>a."
In Puglia, there is a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday, Casms, which can count on one part of Aise, is a secret service that is taking care of the problems in the stadiums.
"The Struggle Leader-Leader and the strained arm during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
This is the idea of Domenica Mazzilli (expressed in a really unlucky way) who is a few weeks director of the Vimin<0xC3><0xA1>l Osservatorio (achieved a place that was previously Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferrizzi).
Mazzilli was previously a quaestor in Terst, where the core of the Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002, is located.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate a leader, but, of course, that the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
“I’m not a sociologist,” adds the Observer Unit, “but crimes are attributed to the country in which they took place.
So far, this group has remained within the bounds, now we will take a good look at what happened and evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about fishing at Mamel’s anthem: it’s not a crime either, but if you allow it, it’s uncultivation.”
